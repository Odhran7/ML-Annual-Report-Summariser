purchasing 

we believe our substantial buying power and our flexibility in making sourcing decisions contributes to our successful purchasing strategy which includes targeted merchandise margin goals by category we leverage our merchandising team to source products that can be sold in both dollar tree and family dollar stores we also believe our ability to negotiate with our vendor partners allows us to minimize the margin impact of economic pressures such as tariffs we buy products on an orderbyorder basis and have no material longterm purchase contracts or other assurances of continued product supply or guaranteed product cost historically no vendor has accounted for more than 10 of total merchandise purchased by us

competition 

our segment of the retail industry is fragmented and highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future we operate in the discount retail sector which is currently and is expected to continue to be highly competitive with respect to price store location merchandise quality assortment and presentation and customer service including merchandise delivery and checkout options our competitors include singleprice dollar stores multiprice dollar stores mass merchandisers online retailers discount retailers drug stores convenience stores independentlyoperated discount stores grocery stores and a wide variety of other retailers in addition several competitors have sections within their stores devoted to “one dollar” price point merchandise which further increases competition we believe we differentiate ourselves from other retailers by providing highvalue highquality lowcost merchandise in attractivelydesigned stores that are conveniently located our sales and profits could be reduced by increases in competition there are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector 

government regulation 

we are subject to a wide variety of local state and federal laws and regulations within the united states and canada compliance with these laws and regulations often requires the dedication of our associates’ time and attention as well as financial resources in fiscal 2021 compliance with these laws and regulations did not have a material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk any failure to meet market expectations including our comparable store sales growth rate earnings and earnings per share or new store openings could cause the market price of our stock to decline you should carefully consider the specific risk factors listed below together with all other information included or incorporated in this report and other filings that we make from time to time with the sec including our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes however the risks and uncertainties that we face are not limited to those described below and those set forth in our sec filings additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also arise in such event our business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected 

profitability and operational risks 

our profitability is vulnerable to increases in oceanic shipping costs domestic freight and fuel costs wage and benefit costs and other operating costs 

future increases in costs such as wage and benefit costs ocean shipping rates domestic freight costs fuel and energy costs the cost of merchandise including the substitution of higher cost domestic goods duties and tariffs merchandise loss due to theft damage or errors and store occupancy costs would reduce our profitability we expect material increases in wage rates and labor costs as well as in shipping rates freight and fuel costs in 2022 we have incurred additional costs as a result of recent minimum wage increases by certain states and localities and we expect additional minimum wage increases by states and localities in 2022 in addition the federal minimum wage may increase depending on the outcome of legislation proposed in congress and the current administration may consider raising the minimum salary for store managers who have exempt status under the fair labor standards act separately government or industry actions addressing the impact of climate change may result in increases in merchandise or operating costs 

in our dollar tree segment we raised our primary price point on merchandise to 125 in fiscal 2021 in addition we continue to implement our dollar tree plus initiative which provides our customers with discretionary categories priced at the 3 and 5 price points although we have increased our price points at dollar tree stores we remain dependent on our ability to adjust our product assortment to operate more efficiently or to increase our comparable store net sales in order to offset cost increases supply chain constraints and higher commodity costs could make it more difficult for us to obtain sufficient quantities of certain products and could negatively affect our product assortment and merchandise costs we can give no assurance that we will be able to adjust our product assortment operate more efficiently or increase our comparable store net sales in the future although family dollar unlike dollar tree can raise the price of merchandise customers may buy fewer products if prices were to increase please see “ item 7 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” for further discussion of the effect of economic factors on our operations 

we are experiencing higher costs and disruptions in our distribution network which have had and could have an adverse impact on our sales margins and profitability 

our success is dependent on our ability to import or transport merchandise to our distribution centers and then truck merchandise to our stores in a timely and costeffective manner we rely heavily on third parties including ocean carriers and truckers in that process we may not anticipate respond to or control all of the challenges of operating our distribution network additionally when a shipping or trucking line fails to deliver on its commitments or our distribution centers fail to operate effectively we could experience increased freight costs or merchandise shortages that could lead to lost sales we are experiencing ocean shipping disruptions trucking shortages increased ocean shipping rates and increased trucking and fuel costs in the last several years we have incurred higher distribution costs due to a variety of factors some of the factors that have had and could have an adverse effect on our distribution network or costs in 2022 are 

• shipping costs we are experiencing unprecedented increases in shipping rates from the transpacific ocean carriers due to various factors including higher demand a continued increase in spot market rates and the limited availability of shipping capacity in fiscal 2021 we found it necessary to rely on an increasingly expensive spot market and other alternative sources to make up the shortfall in our shipping needs when contracted carriers were unable or unwilling to execute on all of our annual contracts import and domestic freight costs will present cost pressure in the first half of fiscal 2022 due to the annualization of fiscal 2021 rates in addition diesel fuel prices are expected to be significantly higher in fiscal 2022 and may increase further because of international tensions there is a risk that our estimated annual freight costs for fiscal 2022 could be higher than we expect if our carrier contract rates for 2022 exceed our expectations our carriers do not fulfill their contractual commitments to us and we find it necessary to increase our use of the spot market andor the spot market rates during 2022 are higher than anticipated a significant increase in our freight costs could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations changes in import duties import quotas and other trade sanctions could also increase our costs 

• shipping disruptions there is currently a shortage of shipping capacity from china and other parts of asia and as a result we are experiencing significant delays in importing our goods we have also experienced issues with port congestion and pandemicrelated port closings and ship diversions our receipt of imported merchandise has been and may be further disrupted or delayed as a result of these or other factors delays could potentially have a material adverse impact on future product availability product mix sales and merchandise margin especially at dollar tree if the delays do not improve these and other disruptions adversely impacted transpacific shipping in 2021 and are expected to continue to affect shipping from china where we buy a significant portion of our merchandise and we cannot predict when the disruptions will end in addition our supply chain may be disrupted as a result of other international events such as armed conflict war economic sanctions or acts of terrorism 

• efficient operations and management distribution centers and other aspects of our distribution network are difficult to operate efficiently and we have experienced and could continue to experience a reduction in operating efficiency resulting in delayed shipments of merchandise to our stores as a result of high associate turnover and challenges in attracting and retaining an adequate and reliable workforce although we have offered signon bonuses enhanced wages and other inducements in certain markets to address the shortage of labor at our distribution centers such measures have increased our costs and are expected to continue to increase our costs which could have an adverse effect on our margins and profitability there can be no assurances that such measures will be adequate to attract and retain the workforce necessary for the efficient operation of our distribution centers 

• trucking costs we have experienced significant increases in trucking costs due to the truck driver shortage and other factors the truck driver shortage has also required us to increase our use of more expensive surge carriers to transport our merchandise we expect our trucking costs to continue to increase in the future 

• diesel fuel costs we have experienced volatility in diesel fuel costs and are expecting increases to continue in fiscal 2022 and may worsen for example because of the impact of international events such as trade restrictions on russia on oil prices 

• vulnerability to natural or manmade disasters including climate change a fire explosion or natural disaster at a port or any of our distribution facilities could result in a loss of merchandise and impair our ability to adequately stock our stores some facilities are vulnerable to earthquakes hurricanes tornadoes or floods and an increase in the severity and frequency of extreme weather events and patterns may increase our operating costs disrupt our supply chain change customer buying patterns result in store closures and impede physical access to our stores 

• labor disagreement labor disagreements disruptions or strikes including at ports may result in lost sales due to delays in the delivery of merchandise to our distribution centers or stores and increase our costs for example the union collective bargaining agreement that governs the wages and benefits of a large number of longshoremen at ports in california oregon and washington is scheduled to expire on july 1 2022 unless extended or a new contract is negotiated if the parties are unable to agree on a new or extended collective bargaining agreement there could be additional shipping delays and disruptions which could adversely affect the availability of imported merchandise and increase our costs 

• directtostore deliveries we rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain consumable merchandise including frozen and refrigerated products in fiscal 2021 we purchased and delivered approximately 14 of our merchandise for our family dollar segment through our relationship with mclane company inc which distributes consumable merchandise from multiple manufacturers we also rely on third parties to deliver frozen and refrigerated product as well as chocolate in the summer to our dollar tree stores to the extent that supply chain disruptions and higher costs affect our suppliers we may be subject to delays or reductions in deliveries and higher costs for merchandise a substantial disruption in our relationship with or in service levels from these suppliers could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

we may stop selling or recall certain products for safetyrelated or other issues 

we may stop selling or recall certain products produced by certain manufacturers for safetyrelated or other issues including product contamination product content such as lead spoilage or other adulteration improper manufacturing processes improper testing product mislabeling or product tampering we may also stop selling or recall products if the products the operations of our suppliers or our operations violate applicable laws or regulations including food drug and cosmetic safety laws or raise potential health and safetyrelated issues including improper storage product mishandling contamination or other adulteration or when our suppliers’ products cause injury illness or death on february 18 2022 following a prior fda and usda inspection of family dollar distribution center 202 in arkansas “dc 202” and subsequent issuance by the fda of form 483 observations primarily regarding rodent infestation at dc 202 as well as other items that require remediation we initiated a voluntary retaillevel product recall of fda and usdaregulated products stored and shipped to approximately 400 stores from dc 202 from january 1 2021 through such date the “recall” any recall may require significant management attention and could result in significant and unexpected costs lost sales compliance or enforcement actions by governmental authorities andor product liability claims or lawsuits in addition our sale of adulterated products could subject us to claims of false or deceptive advertising or other criticism a significant product liability or other legal judgment against us a related regulatory enforcement action or a product recall could materially and adversely affect our reputation financial condition andor results of operations moreover even if a product liability consumer fraud or other claim is unsuccessful has no merit or is not pursued the negative publicity surrounding assertions against the products we sell could materially and adversely affect our business reputation andor profitability additionally the pending recall has led and any future product recall may lead to increased scrutiny of our operations by regulatory agencies requiring further management attention and potential legal fees and other expenses also see “ litigation arbitration and government proceedings may adversely affect our business financial condition andor results of operations” on page 18 for among other things a description of legal proceedings relating to issues associated with dc 202  

our business and results of operations could be materially harmed if we experience a decline in consumer confidence and spending as a result of consumer concerns about the quality and safety of our products 

we could experience a decline in consumer confidence and spending in connection with product recalls if our customers become concerned about the quality and safety of the products we sell to date other than with respect to the stores temporarily closed to permit the removal and destruction of relevant inventory we have not experienced significant lost sales in connection with the recall but there can be no assurances that consumer confidence in the quality and safety of our products resulting from the recall will not decline in the future if there is a decline in consumer confidence in our products our reputation may be adversely affected and we may experience additional lost sales which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

inflation or other adverse change or downturn in economic conditions could impact our sales or profitability 

a deterioration in economic conditions whether related to the covid19 pandemic or otherwise could reduce consumer spending or cause customers to shift their spending to products we either do not sell or do not sell as profitably adverse economic conditions such as a recession could disrupt consumer spending and significantly reduce our sales decrease our inventory turnover cause greater markdowns or reduce our profitability due to lower margins other factors that could result in or exacerbate adverse economic conditions include inflation higher unemployment consumer debt levels trade disputes as well as adverse climate or weather conditions epidemics terrorism or international tensions including armed conflict and economic sanctions 

furthermore factors that could adversely affect consumer disposable income could decrease our customers’ spending on products we sell factors that could reduce our customers’ disposable income and over which we exercise no influence include but are not limited to the covid19 pandemic and other adverse economic conditions described below as well as increases in fuel or other 

energy costs and interest rates lack of available credit higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws increasing healthcare costs and changes in decreases in or elimination of government subsidies such as unemployment and food assistance programs 

although governmental authorities adopted substantial measures including fiscal and monetary stimulus to provide economic assistance to individual households and businesses and support economic stability during the covid19 pandemic and the related recession certain of the government assistance payments to households were temporary and were permitted to expire there can be no assurance that current or future governmental efforts to support the economy during the pandemic or a recession will be sufficient to support future consumer spending at levels experienced in fiscal 2021 or mitigate the negative effect of the pandemic on the economy if consumer spending on the goods we sell declines as a result there could be a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

many of the factors identified above that affect disposable income as well as commodity rates transportation costs including the costs of diesel fuel costs of labor insurance and healthcare foreign exchange rate fluctuations lease costs barriers or increased costs associated with international trade and other economic factors also affect our ability to implement our corporate strategy effectively our cost of goods sold and our selling general and administrative expenses and may have other adverse consequences which we are unable to fully anticipate or control all of which may adversely affect our sales or profitability we have limited or no ability to control many of these factors 

if the covid19 pandemic and associated disruptions worsen or continue longer than expected there could be a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

the continuing covid19 pandemic arising from a novel strain of coronavirus and its variants has caused ongoing direct and indirect economic disruptions that have adversely affected and are expected to continue to adversely affect elements of our business the covid19 pandemic related public health measures and associated economic and social impacts have already contributed to among other things significant increases in the cost of operating our stores and distribution centers decreased foot traffic in our stores disruptions in the patterns of consumer demand and traffic and an increase in demand for online sales which is an insignificant part of our business home deliveries which we began providing in 2021 through our partnership with instacart or curbside deliveries which we do not offer and changes in the labor markets 

there continues to be uncertainty and unpredictability about the impact of covid19related issues on our financial and operating results in future periods if the pandemic worsens or continues longer than expected governments may reinstate or extend business or personal restrictions and we could be forced to curtail or restrict operations or incur additional costs we might also experience new disruptions in our supply chain and sources of supply suffer facility closures or encounter additional difficulties in hiring or retaining the workforce required for our business these circumstances if applicable for an extended duration or across significant parts of our operating footprint or if they fall during particularly meaningful holiday seasons could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we are unable to predict the full extent to which covid19related issues will affect the economy and our customers associates suppliers vendors other business partners or our business results of operations and financial condition if the economic consequences of the pandemic are prolonged andor worsen it could amplify many of the other risks described in this form 10k 

risks associated with our domestic and foreign suppliers could adversely affect our financial performance 

we are dependent on our vendors to supply merchandise in a timely and efficient manner if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments due to financial or other difficulties we could experience merchandise shortages which could lead to lost sales or increased merchandise costs if alternative sources must be used 

we rely on the timely availability of imported goods at favorable wholesale prices merchandise imported directly accounts for approximately 41 to 43 of our dollar tree segment’s total retail value purchases and 15 to 17 of our family dollar segment’s total retail value purchases in addition we believe that a significant portion of our goods purchased from domestic vendors is imported imported goods are generally less expensive than domestic goods and result in higher profit margins a disruption in the flow of our imported merchandise or an increase in the cost of those goods may significantly decrease our profits risks associated with our reliance on imported goods may include disruptions in the flow of or increases in the cost of imported goods because of factors such as 

• duties tariffs or other restrictions on trade including section 301 tariffs that have already been imposed on imported chinese goods and it is uncertain whether the current presidential administration will reduce these tariffs in the future we are currently expecting the amount of section 301 tariffs we pay in 2022 to increase above 2021 levels because the amount of our imports is expected to increase 

• raw material shortages work stoppages government travel restrictions strikes and political unrest including any impact on vendors or shipping arising from epidemics and related travel restrictions such as the covid19 pandemic 

• economic crises in the united states or abroad and international disputes or conflicts including war and economic sanctions 

• changes in currency exchange rates or policies and local economic conditions including inflation including energy prices and raw material costs in the country of origin 

• potential changes to or withdrawal of the united states from international trade agreements or the failure of the united states to maintain normal trade relations with china and other countries 

• changes in leadership and the political climate in countries from which we import products and their relations with the united states and 

• failure of manufacturers outside the united states to meet food drug and cosmetic safety and labeling requirements or environmental standards set by government regulators or consumer expectations 

see “ item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” for further discussion of the effect of foreign suppliers on our operations 

our supply chain may be disrupted by changes in united states trade policy with china 

we rely on domestic and foreign suppliers to provide us with merchandise in a timely manner and at favorable prices among our foreign suppliers china is the source of a substantial majority of our imports a disruption in the flow of our imported merchandise from china or an increase in the cost of those goods may significantly decrease our profits 

the united states has scaled back punitive section 301 tariffs on certain chinese imports based on an agreement reached with china in 2020 however there is uncertainty as to the actions that may be taken under the current presidential administration with respect to us trade policy with china including whether the administration will support reductions in tariffs the imposition of any new us tariffs on chinese imports or the taking of other actions against china in the future and any responses by china could impair our ability to meet customer demand and could result in lost sales or an increase in our cost of merchandise which would have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

our growth is dependent on our ability to increase sales in existing stores and to expand our square footage profitably 

existing store sales growth is critical to good operating results and is dependent on a variety of factors including merchandise quality relevance and availability store operations and customer satisfaction in addition increased competition could adversely affect our sales failure to meet our sales targets including in our renovated stores could result in our needing to record material noncash impairment charges related to our intangible assets we believe increasing sales at family dollar depends in significant part on the success of the h2 renovations and combo store concepts 

our highest sales periods are during the christmas and easter seasons and we generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and our operating and net income during the fourth quarter in anticipation we stock extra inventory and hire many temporary employees to prepare our stores a reduction in sales during these periods could adversely affect our operating results particularly operating and net income to a greater extent than if a reduction occurred at other times of the year untimely merchandise delays due to receiving or distribution problems could have a similar effect 

when easter is observed earlier in the year the selling season is shorter and as a result our sales could be adversely affected easter was observed on april 4 2021 and will be observed on april 17 2022 

expanding our square footage profitably depends on a number of uncertainties including our ability to locate lease build out and open or expand stores in suitable locations on a timely basis under favorable economic terms we also open or expand stores within our established geographic markets where new or expanded stores may draw sales away from our existing stores obtaining an increasing number of profitable stores is an everincreasing challenge 

in addition our expansion is dependent upon thirdparty developers’ abilities to acquire land obtain financing and secure necessary permits and approvals we have experienced higher commodity and other costs associated with the buildout of new stores and the renovation of existing stores we have also experienced delays in new store openings due to inspection permitting and contractor delays we anticipate these increased costs and delays may continue for the foreseeable future which could adversely affect our profitability further we may not manage our expansion effectively and our failure to achieve our expansion plans could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our profitability is affected by the mix of products we sell 

our gross profit margin decreases when we increase the proportion of higher cost goods we sell for example some of our consumable products carry higher costs than other goods so our gross profit margin will be negatively impacted as the percentage of 

our sales from higher cost consumable products increases imported merchandise is generally lower cost than domestic goods our product mix is affected by the supply of goods including imported goods and could be negatively impacted by various factors including the covid19 pandemic and oceanic shipping and port disruptions 

in our family dollar segment our success also depends on our ability to select and obtain sufficient quantities of relevant merchandise at prices that allow us to sell such merchandise at profitable and appropriate prices a sales price that is too high causes products to be less attractive to our customers and our sales at family dollar could suffer we are continuing to refine our pricing strategy at family dollar to drive customer loyalty and have a strategic pricing team to improve our value and to increase profitability inability to successfully implement our pricing strategies at family dollar could have a negative effect on our business 

in addition our family dollar segment has a substantial number of private brand items and the number of items has been increasing we believe our success in maintaining broad market acceptance of our private brands depends on many factors including our pricing costs quality and customer perception we may not achieve or maintain our expected sales for our private brands and as a result our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted additionally the increased number of private brands could negatively impact our existing relationships with our nonprivate brand suppliers 

pressure from competitors may reduce our sales and profits 

the retail industry is highly competitive the marketplace is highly fragmented as many different retailers compete for market share by utilizing a variety of store formats and merchandising strategies including mobile and online shopping we expect competition to increase in the future there are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector some of our current or potential competitors have greater financial resources than we do we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors or that doing so will not require substantial capital expenditures please see “ item 1 business ” for further discussion of the effect of competition on our operations 

our business could be adversely affected if we fail to attract and retain qualified associates and key personnel 

our growth and performance is dependent on the skills experience and contributions of our associates executives and key personnel for both dollar tree and family dollar various factors including the ongoing pandemic constraints on overall labor availability wage rates regulatory or legislative impacts and benefit costs could impact our ability to attract and retain qualified associates at our stores distribution centers and corporate offices 

we are experiencing a shortage of associates and applicants to fill staffing requirements at our distribution centers stores and corporate offices due to the current labor shortage affecting businesses this has adversely affected the operating efficiency of our distribution centers and stores and our ability to transport merchandise from our distribution centers to our stores if we are unable to attract and retain qualified associates for our distribution centers and stores in the future our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 

risks relating to strategic initiatives 

we may not be successful in implementing or in anticipating the impact of important strategic initiatives and our plans for implementing such initiatives may be altered or delayed due to various factors which may have an adverse impact on our business and financial results 

we have adopted important strategic initiatives that are designed to create growth improve our results of operations and drive longterm shareholder value including 

• the conversion of our basic product price from 100 to 125 for the vast majority of merchandise in all dollar tree stores 

• the expansion of a multiprice initiative in dollar tree stores referred to as dollar tree plus  

• the introduction of selected dollar tree merchandise into family dollar stores 

• the rollout of the combo store format that combines a dollar tree store and family dollar store in a single location 

• the renovation of family dollar stores to the h2 format 

• our partnership with instacart to provide home delivery of merchandise purchased online 

• our plans relating to new store openings for dollar tree and family dollar generally and 

• the continued integration of the operations of family dollar with dollar tree 

the implementation and timing of these strategic initiatives are subject to various risks and uncertainties including the acceptance of the amount of price increases by customers and others as justified or reasonable customer acceptance of new store concepts and merchandise offerings construction and permitting delays relating to new and renovated stores the availability of desirable real estate locations for lease at reasonable rates the impact of the covid19 pandemic and associated issues the success of our integration strategies and other factors beyond our control in addition several of these initiatives depend on the timeliness cost and availability of adequate levels of the appropriate domestic and imported merchandise our ability to execute on our plans and expectations with respect to those initiatives and the continued success of our integration of family dollar merchandising supply chain and operations with those of dollar tree to the extent that shipping delays supply chain disruptions and other distribution logistics adversely affect the availability of merchandise necessary to implement our strategic initiatives we may delay or reduce our planned rate of implementation of one or more of those initiatives 

the rollout of our initiative to add price points above 1 in dollar tree stores is subject to additional risks and uncertainties relating to among other things provisions in our leases andor thirdparty waivers tied to single or 1 price points and compliance with the terms of our leases and state and local consumer laws which may restrict price increases deemed unjustified in certain circumstances 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations or that they will generate expected returns which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results 

we could incur losses due to impairment of longlived assets goodwill and intangible assets 

under us generally accepted accounting principles we review our longlived assets for impairment whenever economic events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable identifiable intangible assets with an indefinite useful life including goodwill are not amortized but are evaluated annually for impairment a more frequent evaluation is performed if events or circumstances indicate that impairment could have occurred 

in fiscal 2019 we recorded a 3130 million noncash pretax and aftertax goodwill impairment charge related to our family dollar reporting unit the impairment was a result of business challenges including slower sales growth higher freight shrink and store labor costs should we experience similar business challenges or significant negative industry or general economic trends we could recognize additional impairments to our goodwill intangible assets and other longlived assets we monitor key assumptions and other factors utilized in our goodwill impairment analysis and if business or other market conditions develop that are materially different than we currently anticipate we will conduct an additional impairment evaluation any reduction in or impairment of the value of goodwill or intangible assets will result in a charge against earnings which could have a material adverse impact on our reported results of operations and financial condition for additional information on goodwill impairments please refer to note 1 to our consolidated financial statements under the caption “goodwill and nonamortizing intangible assets” 

cybersecurity and technology risks 

we rely on computer and technology systems in our operations and any material failure inadequacy interruption or security failure of those systems including because of a cyberattack could harm our ability to effectively operate and grow our business and could adversely affect our financial results 

we rely extensively on our computer and technology systems and in certain cases those of thirdparty service providers to manage inventory process credit card and customer transactions and summarize results our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the distribution and sale of our merchandise depends significantly on the confidentiality integrity and availability of these systems and on our ability to successfully integrate the dollar tree and family dollar systems we also rely on thirdparty providers and platforms for some of these computer and technology systems and support 

although we have operational safeguards in place they may not be effective in preventing the failure of these systems or platforms to operate effectively and be available to us this may be as the result of deliberate breach in the security of these systems or platforms by bad actors including through malicious software ransomware and other cyberattacks which may originate from state actors and may increase during times of international tensions failures may also be caused by various other factors including power outages catastrophic events physical theft computer and network failures inadequate or ineffective redundancy problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or platforms flaws in thirdparty software or services errors or improper use by our employees or third party service providers 

if these systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process customer transactions and may receive negative publicity which could adversely affect our results of operations and business in addition remediation of any problems with our systems could take an extensive amount of time and could result in significant unplanned expenses 

the potential unauthorized access to customer information may violate privacy laws and could damage our business reputation subject us to negative publicity litigation and costs and adversely affect our results of operations or business 

many of our information technology systems such as those we use for our pointofsale web and mobile platforms including online and mobile payment systems and for administrative functions including human resources payroll accounting and internal and external communications contain personal financial or other confidential information that is entrusted to us by our customers and associates as well as proprietary and other confidential information related to our business and suppliers 

we have procedures and technology in place to safeguard our customers’ personal information including debit and credit card information our associates’ private data suppliers’ data and our business records and intellectual property and other sensitive information despite these measures we have experienced attempted and ongoing cyberattacks which are rapidly evolving perpetrators who may include wellfunded state actors are becoming increasingly sophisticated and difficult to detect we andor our third party suppliers may be vulnerable to and unable to anticipate detect and appropriately respond to such cybersecurity attacks including data security breaches and data loss 

we are subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions in which we operate regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data for example the california consumer privacy act which became effective on january 1 2020 and the california privacy rights act of 2020 which will become effective on january 1 2023 impose responsibilities on us for the handling disclosure and deletion of personal information for consumers who reside in california these laws permit california to assess potentially significant fines for data privacy violations and create a right for individuals to bring class action suits seeking damages for violations our efforts to comply with california’s consumer privacy laws and other similar privacy and data protection laws may impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to increase over time and we could incur substantial penalties or be subject to litigation related to violation of existing or future data privacy laws and regulations 

likewise we are subject to the payment card industry data security standards “pcidss” which is mandated by the card brands and administered through the payment card industry security standards council as a level 1 merchant we are subject to assessment and attestation for pcidss compliance on an annual basis a failure to meet and maintain compliance with pcidss requirements could result in our inability to continue to accept credit cards as a form of payment which would materially impact our ability to sell our products in addition our credibility and reputation within the business community and with our customers may be affected which could result in our customers discontinuing the use of debit or credit cards in our stores or not shopping in our stores altogether noncompliance with pcidss requirements also may subject us to recurring and accumulating fines until compliance is achieved considerable investments to strengthen our information security could also be required should we ever be deemed to be noncompliant 

moreover significant capital investments and other expenditures could also be required to remedy cybersecurity problems and prevent future security breaches including costs associated with additional security technologies personnel experts and services eg creditmonitoring services for those whose data has been breached these costs which could be material could adversely impact our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred and may not meaningfully limit the success of future attempts to breach our information technology systems 

the unavailability of our information technology systems or the failure of those systems or software to perform as anticipated for any reason and any inability to respond to or recover from such an event could disrupt our business decrease performance and increase overhead costs if we are unable to secure our customers’ credit card and confidential information or other private data relating to our associates suppliers or our business we could be subject to negative publicity costly government enforcement actions or private litigation and increased costs any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or business 

legal and regulatory risks 

litigation arbitration and government proceedings may adversely affect our business financial condition andor results of operations 

our business is subject to the risk of litigation and arbitration involving employees consumers suppliers competitors shareholders government agencies or others through private actions class actions derivative actions governmental investigations administrative proceedings regulatory actions mass arbitration or other similar actions 

in addition due to the types of products that we store and sell our operations are subject to regulatory oversight by the fda the usda the occupational health and safety administration and other federal state local and applicable foreign governmental authorities if such authorities believe that we have failed to comply with applicable regulations andor procedures they may require prompt corrective action andor proceed directly to other forms of enforcement action including the imposition of operating restrictions including a ceasing of operations in one or more facilities enjoining and restraining certain violations of applicable law 

pertaining to products seizure of products and assessing civil or criminal sanctions or penalties any adverse regulatory action depending on its magnitude may restrict us from effectively selling our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition andor results of operations from january 11 2022 through february 11 2022 dc 202 was inspected by the fda and usda on february 11 2022 the fda issued form 483 observations primarily regarding rodent infestation at dc 202 as well as other items that require remediation in connection therewith we initiated the recall temporarily closed dc 202 for extensive cleaning temporarily closed the affected stores to permit the removal and destruction of inventory subject to the recall ceased sales of relevant inventory subject to the recall committed to the fda to continue to cease the shipment of fdaregulated products from dc 202 until fda approval is received and initiated corrective actions at dc 202 intended to ensure that these issues will not recur when shipment of fdaregulated products recommences if the fda andor other governmental authorities are not satisfied with these corrective actions or observe issues in our other distribution centers or stores they may initiate other enforcement or administrative actions which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition andor results of operations also see “ we may stop selling or recall certain products for safetyrelated issues” on page 13

we intend to vigorously defend ourselves in the foregoing and any similar litigations although we have recently received the complaints we do not believe that any of them will individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition however we cannot assure that these litigations individually or in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the period or year in which they are reserved or resolved 

on march 1 2022 a federal grand jury subpoena was issued to us by the eastern district of arkansas requesting the production of information documents and records pertaining to pests sanitation and compliance with law regarding certain of our procedures and products we intend to cooperate fully with the subpoena and any related investigation however no assurance can be given as to the timing or outcome of this matter 

three personal injury lawsuits are pending against us and our vendors alleging that certain talc products that were sold by the company in the past caused cancer we intend to vigorously defend against these claims although we have been able to resolve previous talc lawsuits against us without material loss to the company given the inherent uncertainties and high potential losses of talc litigation there can be no assurances regarding the outcome of pending or future cases future costs to litigate these cases are not known but may be significant and it is uncertain whether our costs will be covered by insurance in addition although we have indemnification rights against our vendors in several of these cases it is uncertain whether the vendors will have the financial ability to carry out their obligations we do not believe that any of these lawsuits will individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition however we cannot assure that these lawsuits individually or in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the period or year in which they are reserved or resolved 

our products or our storage and handling of such products could also cause illness or injury harm our reputation and subject us to litigation we are dependent on our vendors to ensure that the products we buy comply with all applicable safety standards however product liability personal injury or other claims may be asserted against us relating to product contamination product tampering mislabeling recall and other safety issues with respect to the products that we sell or with respect to our handling or storage of such products including as a result of the issues raised by the pending arkansas fda matter which has led to increased scrutiny of our operations by regulatory agencies requiring further management attention and potential legal fees and other expenses a significant product liability or other legal judgment against us a related regulatory compliance or enforcement action or a product recall could materially and adversely affect our reputation financial condition andor results of operations moreover even if a product liability consumer fraud or other claim is unsuccessful has no merit or is not pursued the negative publicity surrounding assertions against the products we sell could materially and adversely affect our reputation we seek but may not be successful in obtaining contractual indemnification from our vendors where appropriate or insurance coverage and if we do not have adequate contractual indemnification or insurance available such product liability or safety claims could adversely affect our business financial condition andor results of operations our ability to obtain the benefit of contractual indemnification from foreign vendors may be hindered by our ability to enforce contractual indemnification obligations against such vendors our litigationrelated expenses could increase as well which also could have a materially negative impact on our financial condition andor results of operations even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued 

the outcome of such matters is difficult to assess or quantify plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits or proceedings may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss may remain unknown for substantial periods of time in addition certain of these matters if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in an expense that may be material to our financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operations are required the cost to defend current and future litigation or proceedings including arbitrations may be significant there also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation including litigation related to product or food safety customer information and environmental or safety requirements which could negatively affect customer perception of our business regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable 

for a discussion of current legal matters please see “ item 3 legal proceedings ” and note 4 to our consolidated financial statements under the caption “contingencies” resolution of these matters if decided against us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations accrued liabilities or cash flows 

changes in laws and government regulations or our failure to adequately estimate the impact of such changes could increase our expenses expose us to legal risks or otherwise adversely affect us 

our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations and changes to those laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business in addition the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations in connection with climate change and the transition to a low carbon economy including any federal or state laws enacted to regulate greenhouse gas emissions could significantly increase our operating or merchandise costs or reduce the demand for our products these laws and regulations may include but are not limited to requirements relating to hazardous waste materials recycling singleuse plastics extended producer responsibility use of refrigerants carbon pricing or carbon taxes product energy efficiency standards and product labeling if carbon pricing or carbon taxes are adopted there is a significant risk that the cost of merchandise from our suppliers will increase and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

in addition significant changes in laws or regulations that impact our relationship with our workforce such as minimum wage increases health care labor laws or workplace safety could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations an increase in federal corporate tax rates also could adversely affect our profitability changes in other regulatory areas such as consumer credit privacy and information security product and food safety energy or environmental protection and tariff and other trade restrictions among others could cause our expenses to increase or result in product recalls further if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations including wage and hour laws we could be subject to legal risk including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation which could adversely affect our results of operations 

risks relating to indebtedness 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition limit our ability to obtain additional financing restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures 

our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to fulfill our obligations and have a negative impact on our financing options and liquidity position as of january 29 2022 our total indebtedness is 345 billion we may in the future incur substantial additional indebtedness in addition we have 15 billion of additional borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility less amounts outstanding for letters of credit totaling 460 million 

in addition our credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and accordingly our cost of capital our ratings reflect the opinions of the ratings agencies of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations there can be no assurance that we will achieve a particular rating or maintain a particular rating in the future 

the terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness may restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to pursue our business strategies and could adversely affect our capital resources financial condition and liquidity 

the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interests including among other things restrictions on our ability to incur liens make changes in lines of business subject to certain exceptions and consolidate or merge with or into or sell all or substantially all of our assets to another person 

in addition certain of these agreements require us to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants our ability to satisfy these financial maintenance covenants can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot assure you that we will meet them 

a breach of the covenants under these agreements could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness which if not cured or waived could result in us having to repay our borrowings before their due dates such default may allow the debt holders to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies if we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or if we were to experience difficulty in refinancing the debt prior to maturity our results of operations or financial condition could be materially affected in addition an event of default under our credit facilities may permit the lenders to terminate all commitments to extend further credit in the event our lenders or holders of notes accelerate the repayment of such borrowings we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay such indebtedness 

as a result of these restrictions we may be limited in how we conduct our business unable to raise additional debt financing to operate during general economic or business downturns or unable to compete effectively take advantage of new business opportunities or grow in accordance with our plans 

our variablerate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our annual debt service obligations to increase significantly 

our revolving credit facility is subject to variable rates that expose us to interest rate risk we may also incur additional indebtedness subject to variable rates in the future interest rates while historically low may increase when interest rates increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same and our net income decreases although we may enter into interest rate swaps involving the exchange of floatingfor fixedrate interest payments to reduce interest rate volatility we cannot assure you we will choose to or be able to do so 

borrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate derived from the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” sofr is a relatively new reference rate and has a very limited history the future performance of sofr cannot be predicted based on its limited historical performance since the initial publication of sofr in april 2018 changes in sofr have on occasion been more volatile than changes in other benchmark or market rates such as united states dollar libor additionally any successor rate to sofr under our revolving credit facility may not have the same characteristics as sofr or libor as a result the amount of interest we may pay on our revolving credit facility is difficult to predict 

risks relating to our common stock 

our business or the value of our common stock could be negatively affected as a result of actions by shareholders 

we value constructive input from investors and regularly engage in dialogue with our shareholders regarding strategy and performance the board of directors and management team are committed to acting in the best interests of all of our shareholders there is no assurance that the actions taken by the board of directors and management in seeking to maintain constructive engagement with our shareholders will be successful shareholders who disagree with our strategy or the way we are managed may seek to effect change in the future through various strategies that could include private engagement publicity campaigns proxy contests and litigation responding to these actions may be costly and timeconsuming disrupt our operations divert the attention of our board of directors management and employees and impact our relationship with investors vendors and other third parties a change in the composition of our board of directors in response to shareholder engagement may result in changes to our business plans operations strategies initiatives governance management and risk factors which could be materially different from those described in this report the perceived uncertainty as to our future direction resulting from these strategies could also affect the market price and volatility of our common stock 

the price of our common stock is subject to market and other conditions and may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors these factors some of which may be beyond our control include the perceived prospects and actual results of operations of our business changes in estimates of our results of operations by analysts investors or us trading activity by our large shareholders trading activity by sophisticated algorithms highfrequency trading our actual results of operations relative to estimates or expectations actions or announcements by us or our competitors litigation and judicial decisions legislative or regulatory actions or changes and changes in general economic or market conditions in addition the stock market in general has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations these market fluctuations could reduce the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our operating performance 

certain provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws could delay or discourage a change of control transaction that may be in a shareholder’s best interest 

our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may delay or discourage a takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider in hisher best interest these provisions among other things 

• provide that only the board of directors the chairman of the board or the chief executive officer may call special meetings of the shareholders 

• establish certain advance notice procedures for nominations of candidates for election as directors and for shareholder proposals to be considered at shareholders’ meetings and 

• permit the board of directors without further action of the shareholders to issue and fix the terms of preferred stock which may have rights senior to those of the common stock 

however we believe that these provisions allow our board of directors to negotiate a higher price in the event of a takeover attempt which would be in the best interest of our shareholders

 item 2 properties 

as of january 29 2022 we operated 15840 stores across the contiguous united states and the district of columbia and operated 237 stores within five canadian provinces 

the dollar tree segment includes 8061 stores operating under the dollar tree and dollar tree canada brands with stores predominantly ranging from 8000  10000 selling square feet the family dollar segment includes 8016 stores operating under the family dollar brand with stores predominantly ranging from 6000  8000 selling square feet for additional information on store counts and square footage by segment for the years ended january 29 2022 and january 30 2021 see “ item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” under the caption “overview” 

we lease the vast majority of our stores and expect to lease the majority of our new stores as we expand our leases typically provide for a short initial lease term generally between five and ten years with options to extend in some cases we have initial lease terms of up to fifteen years we believe this leasing strategy enhances our flexibility to pursue various expansion opportunities resulting from changing market conditions as current leases expire we believe that we will be able to obtain lease renewals if desired for present store locations or to obtain leases for equivalent or better locations in the same general area 

our network of distribution centers is strategically located throughout the united states to support our stores as of january 29 2022 we operated 26 distribution centers occupying a total of 240 million square feet 15 of which are primarily dedicated to serving our dollar tree stores and 11 distribution centers primarily serve our family dollar stores our st george utah distribution center services both family dollar and dollar tree stores and we expect future distribution centers to be built with the capability to service both dollar tree and family dollar stores our distribution network supports multiple store formats including h2 combo stores and dollar tree plus we ship to our h2 format stores from our family dollar distribution centers and we ship to our dollar tree plus format stores from our dollar tree distribution centers our combo stores receive shipments from both dollar tree and family dollar distribution centers we believe our distribution center network is currently capable of supporting approximately 353 billion in annual sales in the united states except for 04 million square feet of our distribution center in san bernardino california all of our distribution center capacity is owned 

each of our distribution centers contains advanced materials handling technologies including radiofrequency inventory tracking equipment and specialized information systems with the exception of four of our facilities each of our distribution centers in the united states also contains automated conveyor and sorting systems 

distribution services in canada are provided by a third party from facilities in british columbia and ontario 

our store support center in chesapeake virginia is located in an approximately 05 million square foot office tower that we own in the summit pointe development we are also developing additional parcels on our summit pointe property for mixeduse purposes and began leasing some portions during fiscal 2020 

for more information on financing of our new expanded and renovated stores distribution centers and the summit pointe development activities see “ item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” under the caption “funding requirements”

initiatives and recent developments 

our initiatives as well as other recent developments that have had or are expected to have a significant effect on our operations are listed below 

• dollar tree 

◦ in september 2021 we announced our new 125 price point initiative and as of january 29 2022 we increased the price point on a majority of our 1 merchandise to 125 in more than 5800 legacy dollar tree stores we completed the rollout of this initiative to all dollar tree stores during the first quarter of fiscal 2022 to date the increase in the price point has more than offset the decline in the number of units sold we expect to see a greater lift in gross margin in the first half of the year as we sell through our current inventory we plan to invest in new products and modify existing products to provide greater value for our customers and increase customer traffic and store productivity 

◦ after a successful launch of the instacart platform in the family dollar segment we began testing the online service delivery at dollar tree stores in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 as of january 29 2022 the instacart platform covers nearly 7000 dollar tree stores this enables our customers to shop online and receive sameday delivery without having to visit a store 

◦ in fiscal 2021 we continued to implement our dollar tree plus initiative which introduces products priced at the 3 and 5 price points and provides our customers with extraordinary value in discretionary categories as of january 29 2022 we have approximately 660 dollar tree plus stores we plan to accelerate the implementation of the dollar tree plus initiative in fiscal 2022 by adding the concept to an additional 1500 stores 

◦ the rollout of our crafter’s square initiative to all of our dollar tree stores was completed during fiscal 2020 the crafter’s square assortment carries markups which are higher than our average markup 

• family dollar 

◦ in march 2019 we announced plans for a store optimization program for family dollar for fiscal 2019 this program included rolling out a new model for both new and renovated family dollar stores internally known as h2 rebannering selected stores to the dollar tree brand closing underperforming stores and installing adult beverages and expanding freezers and coolers in selected stores our h2 stores have significantly improved merchandise offerings throughout the store including the addition of approximately 20 dollar tree 100 merchandise sections which transitioned to 125 in the first quarter of 2022 and establishing a minimum number of freezer and cooler doors these stores have higher customer traffic and provide a higher average comparable store net sales lift when compared to nonrenovated stores in the first year following renovation h2 stores perform well in a variety of locations and especially in locations where our family dollar stores have been most challenged in the past as of january 29 2022 we have approximately 3815 h2 stores and we plan to complete 800 h2 store renovations in fiscal 2022 in addition we added adult beverage to 275 stores in fiscal 2021 we believe the addition of adult beverage to our assortment will drive traffic to our stores 

◦ building on the success of the h2 format in march 2021 we announced the development of a new combination store format combo stores leverage the strengths of the dollar tree and family dollar brands under one roof to serve small towns across the country we are taking family dollar’s great value and assortment and blending in select dollar tree merchandise categories creating a new store format targeted for small towns and rural communities with populations of 3000 to 4000 residents as of january 29 2022 we had more than 240 combo stores in operation due to the success of this initiative we plan to accelerate expansion of the program in fiscal 2022 by adding 400 new renovated or relocated combo stores 

◦ after a successful pilot program in 2020 in february 2021 we entered into a partnership with instacart which covers more than 6000 family dollar stores across the united states as of january 29 2022 

◦ in fiscal 2019 the results of our annual goodwill impairment test showed that the fair value of the family dollar reporting unit was lower than its carrying value resulting in a 3130 million noncash pretax and aftertax goodwill impairment charge 

◦ in fiscal 2019 we substantially completed the consolidation of the store support center in matthews north carolina to our summit pointe development in chesapeake virginia 

◦ on february 11 2022 the fda issued form 483 observations primarily regarding rodent infestation at dc 202 as well as other items that require remediation we initiated a voluntary retaillevel product recall of fda and usdaregulated products stored and shipped to approximately 400 stores from dc 202 from january 1 2021 through february 18 2022 temporarily closed dc 202 for extensive cleaning temporarily closed approximately 400 affected stores to permit the removal and destruction of inventory subject to the recall ceased sales of relevant inventory subject to the recall committed to the fda to continue to cease the shipment of fdaregulated products from dc 202 until fda approval is received and initiated corrective actions at dc 202 intended to ensure that these issues will not recur when shipment of fdaregulated products recommences the recall may have material adverse consequences see “ item 3 legal proceedings ” and note 4 to our consolidated financial statements under the caption “contingencies” for information concerning the proposed class action complaints filed against family dollar related to these matters we anticipate additional lawsuits of a similar nature related to the recall see also “ item 1a risk factors ” “ litigation arbitration and government proceedings may adversely affect our business financial condition andor results of operations ” and “ we may stop selling or recall certain products for safetyrelated issues ” 

• supply chain 

◦ in the third quarter of 2019 we opened a new 12 million square foot distribution center in morrow county ohio 

◦ in the third quarter of 2020 we opened a new 12 million square foot distribution center in rosenberg texas and opened the first phase of our new ocala florida distribution center 

◦ the following factors have impacted our operations in fiscal 2021 and we expect these challenges to continue in fiscal 2022 

▪ shipping delays we rely heavily on transpacific shipping to acquire merchandise for our stores and we are experiencing significant shipping delays as a result of the shipping capacity shortage which have negatively impacted our sales and the availability of product in the stores we are also experiencing issues with port congestion and pandemicrelated port closings and ship diversions if the shipping delays do not improve they would continue to have a material adverse impact on product availability and product mix and on our sales and merchandise margin sales could be negatively impacted if imported goods do not arrive in time to stock our stores including the timely delivery of adequate levels of seasonal merchandise for the important christmas holidays if higher cost domestic goods are substituted for delayed imports our merchandise margin could be adversely impacted to address delays in shipments we are prioritizing product categories for shipment in an effort to obtain seasonal assortments in advance of holiday seasons adding and evaluating the use of longterm and shortterm chartered vessels and adding alternative sources of supply from north american factories 

▪ freight costs we are experiencing significantly higher international and domestic freight costs as a result of disruptions in the global supply chain this trend is likely to continue the combination of increased demand and limited availability of transpacific shipping capacity has caused spot market prices to increase substantially we are a large importer of merchandise from asia and particularly sensitive to freight costs import and domestic freight costs will present cost pressure in the first half of fiscal 2022 due to the annualization of fiscal 2021 rates in addition diesel fuel prices are expected to be significantly higher in fiscal 2022 and may increase further because of international tensions we are working to reduce our freight costs by using chartered vessels evaluating and securing longterm contracts with our carriers for vessels dedicated in large part to our needs and adding alternative sources of supply that do not rely on transpacific shipping 

▪ labor shortage we are experiencing a shortage of associates and applicants to fill staffing requirements at our distribution centers due to the current labor shortage affecting businesses this has adversely affected the operating efficiency of our distribution centers and our ability to transport merchandise from our distribution centers to our stores the steps we have taken to address the labor shortage at our distribution centers include hosting national hiring events paying signon bonuses offering enhanced wages in select competitive markets which is expected to increase our costs by more than 300 million in fiscal 2022 and paying tuition reimbursement 

• minimum wage increases wage investments and store labor shortages 

in 2022 the minimum wage has increased in certain states and localities in addition the federal minimum wage may increase depending on the outcome of legislation proposed in congress minimum wage increases in states and localities and wage investments in certain markets are expected to increase our costs by more than 1650 million in 

2022 we are also experiencing a shortage of associates and applicants to fill staffing requirements at our stores due to the current labor shortage affecting businesses 

• buildout and construction costs and delays 

we have experienced higher commodity and other costs associated with the buildout of new stores and the renovation of existing stores in addition we have experienced delays in new store openings due to inspection permitting and contractor delays we anticipate these increased costs and delays may continue for the foreseeable future 

• impact of covid19 

as an essential business our stores and distribution centers have remained open during the pandemic however our business trends and financial results in 2020 were materially different than in prior years our results of operations in fiscal 2020 include approximately 2790 million of covid19related expenses and these expenses totaled 335 million in fiscal 2021 and we expect them to be minimal in fiscal 2022 

the future impact of covid19 on our customers and our business is difficult to predict the course of the pandemic the effectiveness of health measures such as vaccines and the impact of ongoing economic stabilization efforts is uncertain and government assistance payments may not provide enough funding to support future consumer spending at levels experienced during fiscal 2020 and 2021 for example although the american rescue plan act of 2021 “rescue act” which was enacted on march 11 2021 provided us government funding to address the continuing impact of covid19 on the economy public health individuals and businesses some of the enacted benefits including 1400 direct payments to individuals and supplemental unemployment benefits were temporary and have been discontinued given the level of volatility and uncertainty surrounding the future impact of covid19 on our customers suppliers and the broader economies in the locations that we operate as well as uncertainty around the future impact on our supply chain and the global supply chain it is challenging to predict our future operations and financial results 

• longterm debt 

◦ during the fourth quarter of 2019 we prepaid 5000 million of the 7500 million senior floating rate notes due 2020 and accelerated the expensing of 03 million of deferred financing costs 

◦ during the first quarter of 2020 we repaid the remaining 2500 million outstanding under the senior floating rate notes 

◦ during the first quarter of 2020 we preemptively drew 7500 million on our revolving credit facility to reduce our exposure to potential shortterm liquidity risk in the banking system as a result of the covid19 pandemic all of which was repaid by the end of the third quarter of 2020 

◦ during the fourth quarter of 2020 we repaid the 3000 million 500 senior notes that we assumed upon the acquisition of family dollar 

◦ during the fourth quarter of 2021 we refinanced our longterm debt obligations as follows 

▪ we completed the registered offering of 8000 million of 265 senior notes due 2031 and 4000 million of 3375 senior notes due 2051 and used the proceeds of the offering to redeem the 10 billion 2023 notes which resulted in our incurring a 438 million prepayment penalty and we accelerated the expensing of 27 million of deferred financing and original issue discount costs associated with the 2023 notes 

▪ we entered into a credit agreement for a 15 billion revolving credit facility which replaced our thenexisting 125 billion revolving credit facility 

for additional information regarding the risks related to our business and operations including risks relating to the implementation of our dollar tree and family dollar initiatives see “ item 1a risk factors ” 

overview 

we are a leading operator of more than 16000 retail discount stores and we conduct our operations in two reporting segments our dollar tree segment is the leading operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise predominantly at the fixed price of 125 our family dollar segment operates general merchandise retail discount stores providing consumers with a selection of competitivelypriced merchandise in convenient neighborhood stores 

our net sales are derived from the sale of merchandise two major factors tend to affect our net sales trends first is our success at opening new stores second is the performance of stores once they are open sales vary at our existing stores from one year to the next we refer to this as a change in comparable store net sales because we include only those stores that are open throughout both of the periods being compared beginning after the first fifteen months of operation we include sales from stores expanded or remodeled 

during the year in the calculation of comparable store net sales which has the effect of increasing our comparable store net sales the term ‘expanded’ also includes stores that are relocated stores that have been rebannered are considered to be new stores and are not included in the calculation of the comparable store net sales change until after the first fifteen months of operation under the new brand 

at january 29 2022 we operated stores in 48 states and the district of columbia as well as stores in five canadian provinces a breakdown of store counts and square footage by segment for the years ended january 29 2022 and january 30 2021 is as follows 



stores are included as rebanners when they close or open respectively comparable store net sales for dollar tree may be negatively affected when a family dollar store is rebannered near an existing dollar tree store 

the average size of stores opened in 2021 was approximately 8760 selling square feet or about 11050 gross square feet for the dollar tree segment and 8880 selling square feet or about 10990 gross square feet for the family dollar segment for 2022 we continue to plan to open stores that are 8000  10000 selling square feet or about 10000  12000 gross square feet for both the dollar tree segment and the family dollar segment we believe that these size stores are in the ranges of our optimal sizes operationally and give our customers a shopping environment which invites them to shop longer buy more and make return visits 

fiscal 2021 fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 each included 52 weeks 

the percentage change in comparable store net sales on a constant currency basis for the fiscal year ended january 29 2022 as compared with the preceding year is as follows 



constant currency basis refers to the calculation excluding the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations we calculated the constant currency basis change by translating the current year’s comparable store net sales in canada using the prior year’s currency exchange rates we believe that the constant currency basis provides a more accurate measure of comparable store net sales performance comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores which we include in the calculation and are negatively affected when we open new stores rebanner stores or expand stores near existing stores 

results of operations 

our results of operations and yearoveryear changes are discussed in the following section note that gross profit margin is calculated as gross profit ie net sales less cost of sales divided by net sales the selling general and administrative expense rate and operating income margin are calculated by dividing the applicable amount by total revenue 

net sales 



the increase in net sales from 2020 to 2021 was a result of sales of 7034 million at new stores and a comparable store net sales increase in the dollar tree segment partially offset by a net decrease in sales in the current year from stores closed in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 

enterprise comparable store net sales increased 10 on a constant currency basis in 2021 as a result of a 45 increase in average ticket and a 33 decrease in customer traffic comparable store net sales increased 11 when including the impact of canadian currency fluctuations on a constant currency basis comparable store net sales increased 21 in the dollar tree segment and decreased 01 in the family dollar segment 

in 2020 the dollar tree segment had a comparable store net sales increase of 22 and the family dollar segment had a comparable store net sales increase of 105 the family dollar segment increase was due to higher demand for essential products in the early stages of the covid19 pandemic and higher demand for discretionary items later in 2020 

gross profit 



the decrease in gross profit margin from 2020 to 2021 was a result of the net of the following 

• merchandise cost including freight increased 140 basis points in 2021 compared to 2020 resulting primarily from higher freight costs in both segments partially offset by increased initial markon in both segments and higher sales of lower cost discretionary merchandise in the dollar tree segment primarily due to higher easter seasonal sellthrough 

• markdown costs increased 10 basis points resulting from a reserve for a product recall and higher clearance markdowns on the family dollar segment partially offset by lower seasonal markdowns on the dollar tree segment and 104 million of uninsured markdown costs for stores affected by civil unrest in 2020 

• occupancy costs increased 5 basis points primarily due to the loss of leverage from the comparable store net sales decrease on the family dollar segment 

• distribution costs decreased 5 basis points resulting from covid19related expenses in 2020 of 363 million including covid19 premium pay for all hourly associates for all hours worked from march 8 2020 through january 2 2021 partially offset by hourly wage increases at the distribution centers in 2021 and higher depreciation costs on the dollar tree segment resulting from the two new distribution centers covid19related expenses at the distribution centers in 2021 were 88 million 

• shrink costs decreased 40 basis points resulting from favorable inventory results in relation to accruals and decreases in the accrual rates on both the family dollar and dollar tree segments in the current year 

selling general and administrative expenses 



the decrease in the selling general and administrative expense rate from 2020 to 2021 was the result of the net of the following 

• payroll expenses decreased 70 basis points primarily due to lower covid19related store payroll costs and lower incentive and stock compensation expenses partially offset by minimum wage increases in the current year and higher health care costs fiscal 2021 and 2020 included 176 million and 2126 million respectively of covid19related payroll costs the covid19 expenses in 2021 were primarily for quarantine and sick pay as well as the related payroll taxes the prior year expenses were for store payroll costs for a wage premium paid to all store hourly associates for all hours worked from march 8 2020 through september 26 2020 bonuses for certain field management associates guaranteed bonus payouts and thank you bonuses for store managers quarantine pay and sick pay as well as the related payroll taxes 

• other selling general and administrative expenses increased 10 basis points primarily due to higher debit and credit fees as a result of increased debit and credit card penetration and higher advertising costs 

we recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of 3130 million in fiscal 2019 as discussed further in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements under the caption “goodwill and nonamortizing intangible assets” excluding the goodwill impairment charge in 2019 the selling general and administrative expense rate was 232 in 2019 

operating income 



operating income margin decreased to 69 in fiscal 2021 compared to 74 in fiscal 2020 in the current year the decrease in gross profit margin was partially offset by the decrease in the selling general and administrative expense rate as described above operating income in fiscal 2021 included 335 million of covid19related expenses operating income in fiscal 2020 included 2790 million of covid19related expenses and 182 million of uninsured expenses related to civil unrest 

excluding the noncash goodwill impairment charge in 2019 operating income margin was 67 in 2019 

interest expense net 



interest expense net increased 316 million in fiscal 2021 compared to the prior year resulting from the refinancing of our debt in the fourth quarter of 2021 which resulted in prepayment penalties of 438 million and the acceleration of the expensing of 27 million of amortizable noncash deferred financing costs these increases were partially offset by lower average debt outstanding in the current year 

provision for income taxes 



the effective tax rate for 2021 was 186 compared to 229 for 2020 the 2021 effective rate decreased compared to the prior year rate primarily resulting from a deferred tax benefit related to state entity restructuring in the current year and additional tax deductions in the current year related to restricted stock vesting in the prior year the restricted stock vesting resulted in an increase in tax expense 

segment information 

we operate a chain of more than 16000 retail discount stores in 48 states and five canadian provinces our operations are conducted in two reporting business segments dollar tree and family dollar we define our segments as those operations whose results our chief operating decision maker “codm” regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources 

we measure the results of our segments using among other measures each segment’s net sales gross profit and operating income the codm reviews these metrics for each of our reporting segments we may revise the measurement of each segment’s operating income as determined by the information regularly reviewed by the codm if the measurement of a segment changes prior period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period’s presentation corporate support and other consists primarily of store support center costs that are considered shared services and therefore these selling general and administrative costs are excluded from our two reporting business segments these costs include operating expenses for our store support center and the results of operations for our summit pointe property in chesapeake virginia the family dollar segment “operating income” includes advertising revenue which is a component of “other revenue” in the accompanying consolidated income statements prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 

dollar tree 

the following table summarizes the operating results of the dollar tree segment 



net sales for the dollar tree segment increased 50 or 6571 million in 2021 compared to 2020 due to sales from new stores of 4462 million and a 21 increase in comparable store net sales average ticket increased 39 and customer traffic declined 18 in 2021 

gross profit margin for the dollar tree segment decreased to 331 in 2021 from 343 in 2020 the decrease is due to the net of the following 

• merchandise cost including freight increased 170 basis points due primarily to higher freight costs partially offset by increased initial markon and higher sales of higher margin discretionary merchandise including higher seasonal sellthrough

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates certain of our estimates require a high level of judgment and have the potential to have a material effect on the financial statements if actual results vary significantly from those estimates following is a discussion of the estimates that we consider critical 

inventory valuation 

as discussed in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements under the caption “merchandise inventories” inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost determined on a weightedaverage basis cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weightedaverage basis under the retail inventory method the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated costtoretail ratio to the retail value of inventories the retail inventory method is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis 

inventory valuation methods require certain management estimates and judgments including estimates of future merchandise markdowns and shrink which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins the averaging required in applying the retail inventory method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns could under certain circumstances result in costs not being recorded in the proper period 

we estimate our markdown reserve based on the consideration of a variety of factors including but not limited to quantities of slow moving or seasonal carryover merchandise on hand historical markdown statistics and future merchandising plans the accuracy 

of our estimates can be affected by many factors some of which are outside of our control including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends historically we have not experienced significant differences in our estimated reserve for markdowns compared with actual results 

our accrual for shrink is based on the actual historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories adjusted if necessary for current economic conditions and business trends these estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger our physical inventory counts are generally taken between january and october of each year therefore the shrink accrual recorded at january 29 2022 is based on estimated shrink for most of 2021 including the fourth quarter the amounts recorded in the current year reflect the dollar tree and family dollar segments’ historical results we periodically adjust our shrink estimates to reflect our best estimates based on the factors described and historically these adjustments have not been material 

our management believes that our application of the retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market each year on a consistent basis 

selfinsurance liabilities 

the liabilities related to our selfinsurance programs for workers’ compensation and general liability are estimates that require judgment and the use of assumptions semiannually we obtain thirdparty actuarial valuations to aid in valuing the liabilities and in determining the amount to accrue during the year these actuarial valuations are estimates based on our historical loss development factors and the related accruals are adjusted as management’s estimates change 

management’s estimate for selfinsurance liabilities could vary from the ultimate loss sustained given the difficulty in predicting future events however historically the net total of these differences has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair values these assets are not amortized but are evaluated annually for impairment a more frequent evaluation is performed if events or circumstances indicate that impairment could have occurred such events or circumstances could include but are not limited to significant negative industry or economic trends unanticipated changes in the competitive environment and a significant sustained decline in the market price of our stock 

for purposes of our goodwill impairment evaluation the reporting units are family dollar dollar tree and dollar tree canada goodwill has been assigned to the reporting units based on prior business combinations related to the brands in the event a qualitative assessment of the fair value of a reporting unit indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount we then estimate the fair value using a combination of a market multiple method and a discounted cash flow method under the market multiple approach we estimate a fair value based on comparable companies’ market multiples of revenues and earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” and adjusted for a control premium under the discounted cash flow approach we project future cash flows which are discounted using a weightedaverage cost of capital analysis that reflects current market conditions adjusted for specific reporting unit risks primarily the uncertainty of achieving projected operating cash flows if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

the family dollar goodwill and trade name comprise a substantial portion of our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and management’s judgment utilized in the family dollar goodwill and trade name impairment evaluations is critical the computations require management to make estimates and assumptions and actual results may differ significantly particularly if there are significant adverse changes in the operating environment critical assumptions that are used as part of a quantitative family dollar goodwill evaluation include 

• the potential future revenue ebitda and cash flows of the reporting unit the projections use management’s assumptions about economic and market conditions over the projected period as well as our estimates of future performance and reporting unit revenue gross margin expenses and other factors the resulting revenue ebitda and cash flow estimates are based on our most recent business operating plans and various growth rates are assumed for years beyond the current business plan period we did not perform a quantitative evaluation in fiscal 2021 however we believe that the assumptions estimates and rates used in our fiscal 2020 impairment evaluations are reasonable variations in the assumptions estimates and rates could result in significantly different estimates of fair value 

• selection of an appropriate discount rate calculating the present value of future cash flows requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate which is based on a weightedaverage cost of capital analysis the discount rate is affected by changes in shortterm interest rates and longterm yield as well as variances in the typical capital structure of marketplace participants given current economic conditions it is possible that the discount rate will fluctuate in the near term during 

fiscal 2020 we engaged third party experts to assist in the determination of the weightedaverage cost of capital used to discount the cash flows for our family dollar reporting unit we did not perform a quantitative analysis in fiscal 2021 however the weightedaverage cost of capital used to discount the cash flows for our evaluation was 825 for our fiscal 2020 analysis 

indefinitelived intangible assets such as the family dollar trade name are not subject to amortization but are reviewed at least annually for impairment the indefinitelived intangible asset impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible assets to their carrying values we estimate the fair value of our trade name intangible asset based on an income approach using the relieffromroyalty method this approach is dependent upon a number of factors including estimates of future growth and trends royalty rates discount rates and other variables we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain the discount rate includes a premium compared to the discount used for the family dollar goodwill impairment evaluation due to the inherently higher risk profile of intangible assets compared to the overall reporting unit 

our evaluation of goodwill did not result in impairment charges being recorded in fiscal 2021 or 2020 a noncash impairment charge of 3130 million was recorded in fiscal 2019 related to the family dollar reporting unit our evaluation of the family dollar trade name did not result in impairment charges during fiscal 2021 2020 or 2019 based on the results of the 2020 quantitative evaluation the fair value of the family dollar reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by a significant margin and the fair value of the family dollar trade name exceeded its carrying value by approximately 75 

for additional information related to goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets including the related impairment evaluations refer to note 1 to our consolidated financial statements under the caption “goodwill and nonamortizing intangible assets” for additional information related to uncertainties associated with the key assumptions and any potential events andor circumstances that could have a negative effect on the key assumptions please refer to “ item 1a risk factors ” and elsewhere within this “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” if our assumptions and related estimates change in the future we may be required to record impairment charges against earnings in future periods any impairment charges that we may take in the future could be material to our results of operations and financial condition

overview 

we are a leading operator of discount variety stores we believe the convenience and value we offer are key factors in serving and growing our base of loyal customers at january 30 2021 we operated 15685 discount variety retail stores our stores operate under the brand names of dollar tree family dollar and dollar tree canada 

we operate in two reporting business segments dollar tree and family dollar for discussion of the operating results of our reporting business segments refer to “ item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” under the caption “segment information” and note 12 to our consolidated financial statements 

impact of covid19 

beginning in fiscal 2020 our business was affected by the covid19 pandemic as an essential business our stores and distribution centers have remained open during the pandemic however our business trends and operations have been impacted in various ways for example we have experienced fewer customer visits and higher average ticket and the mix and profit margin of products purchased by our customers has differed from historical patterns we have seen a shift in our customers’ purchases towards highermargin discretionary products we have also experienced changes in when our customers are shopping relative to the dates of seasonal holidays with spending occurring further in advance of the holidays than in previous years 

the future impact of covid19 on our customers is difficult to predict as the course of the pandemic the effectiveness of health measures and the impact of ongoing economic stabilization efforts is uncertain and government assistance payments may not provide enough funding to support current spending levels the american rescue plan act of 2021 “rescue act” which was enacted on march 11 2021 provides us government funding to address the continuing impact of covid19 on the economy public health individuals and businesses among other things the rescue act provides for 1400 direct payments to individuals continues supplemental unemployment benefits until september 2021 extends a prior increase in food stamp benefits expands the child tax credit and earned income tax credit provides for rent and utility assistance and funds covid19 vaccinations testing treatment and prevention an increase in the federal minimum wage was not included in the rescue act as enacted during fiscal 2020 we paid wage premiums to our store and distribution center associates as well as “thank you” bonuses to our store managers in recognition of their extraordinary efforts during the covid19 pandemic which increased our costs we currently do not anticipate paying these types of premiums and bonuses in fiscal 2021 

as a result of covid19 our supply chain has been strained and our suppliers have faced challenges in keeping up with the unprecedented demand for essential goods as well as discretionary goods recently the oceanshipping industry has faced capacity issues resulting in higher costs and delays in the shipment of products from asia we continue to make operational changes in an attempt to minimize the impact of these challenges on our business however we do not know how long these disruptions will continue for additional information regarding the impact of covid19 on our business refer to the discussion in this item 1 below and “ item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” 

dollar tree

we strive to exceed our customers’ expectations of the variety and quality of products they can purchase for 100 by offering items we believe typically sell for higher prices elsewhere we buy approximately 60 to 62 of our merchandise domestically and import the remaining 38 to 40 our domestic purchases include basic home closeouts and promotional merchandise we believe our mix of imported and domestic merchandise affords our buyers flexibility that allows them to consistently exceed our customers’ expectations in addition direct relationships with manufacturers permit us to select from a broad range of products and customize packaging product sizes and package quantities that meet our customers’ needs 

we believe that our initiatives positively affect our comparable store net sales in fiscal 2019 we introduced our crafter’s square initiative in more than 650 stores this offering includes a new expanded assortment of arts and crafts supplies during fiscal 2020 we expanded this program completing the rollout to all of our dollar tree stores the crafter’s square assortment carries markups which are higher than our average markup additionally for more than a year we have tested a multiprice initiative referred to as dollar tree plus beginning in fiscal 2019 we began testing multiprice assortments in more than 100 stores in southwestern markets 

based on learnings from the test we made modifications to the mix of products offered to include primarily discretionary items the displays and signage to drive awareness and excitement to the stores the price points to focus on the 1 3 and 5 price points and increase the number of offerings above the 1 price point we plan to expand this initiative into a total of 500 stores beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 we believe these initiatives have and will continue to enable us to increase sales and earnings 

we carry approximately 7500 items in our dollar tree stores and as of the end of fiscal 2020 approximately 34 of our items are automatically replenished the remaining items are pushed to the stores and a portion can be reordered by our store managers on a weekly basis through automatic replenishment and our store managers’ ability to order product each store manager is able to satisfy the demands of their particular customer base 

we maintain a balanced selection of products within traditional variety store categories we offer a wide selection of everyday basic products and we supplement these basic everyday items with seasonal closeout and promotional merchandise we attempt to keep certain basic consumable merchandise in our stores continuously to establish our stores as a destination and increase traffic in our stores closeout and promotional merchandise is purchased opportunistically and represents less than 10 of our purchases 

the merchandise mix in our dollar tree stores consists of 

• consumable merchandise which includes everyday consumables such as household paper and chemicals food candy health and personal care products and in many stores frozen and refrigerated food 

• variety merchandise which includes toys durable housewares gifts stationery party goods greeting cards softlines arts and crafts supplies and other items and

family dollar 

our family dollar segment operates general merchandise retail discount stores providing customers with a selection of competitivelypriced merchandise in convenient neighborhood stores our stores predominantly range from 6000  8000 selling square feet in our 7880 family dollar stores we sell merchandise at prices that generally range from 100 to 1000 the family dollar segment consists of our store operations under the family dollar brand and 11 distribution centers we are the owners of the trademarks “family dollar” “family dollar stores” and other names and designs of certain merchandise sold in family dollar stores 

our family dollar stores provide customers with a quality highvalue assortment of basic necessities and seasonal merchandise we offer competitivelypriced national brands from leading manufacturers alongside name brand equivalentvalue lowerpriced private labels we purchase merchandise from a wide variety of suppliers and generally have not experienced difficulty in obtaining adequate quantities of merchandise in fiscal 2020 we purchased approximately 13 of our merchandise through our relationship with mclane company inc which distributes consumable merchandise from multiple manufacturers in addition approximately 16 of our merchandise is imported directly 

we are executing several initiatives in our family dollar stores to increase sales during 2020 we entered into a partnership with instacart to enable our customers to shop online and receive merchandise without having to visit a store during 2019 we introduced a new model for both new and renovated family dollar stores internally known as h2 this h2 model has significantly improved merchandise offerings including approximately 20 dollar tree 100 merchandise sections and establishing a minimum number of freezer and cooler doors throughout the store h2 stores have higher customer traffic and provide an average comparable store net sales lift in excess of 10 when compared to nonrenovated stores in the first year following renovation h2 stores perform well in a variety of locations and especially in locations where our family dollar stores have been most challenged in the past as of january 30 2021 we have approximately 2385 h2 stores we plan to renovate at least 1250 stores to this format in fiscal 2021 and also plan to build new stores in this format 

building on the success of the h2 format we have developed a combination store which leverages both the dollar tree and family dollar brands to serve small towns across the country we are combining family dollar’s great value and assortment with dollar tree’s “thrill of the hunt” and fixed price point creating a new strategic store format targeted for small towns and rural communities with populations of 3000 to 4000 residents 

while the number of items in a given store can vary based on the store’s size geographic location merchandising initiatives and other factors our typical family dollar store generally carries approximately 7600 basic items alongside items that are everchanging and seasonallyrelevant throughout the year

business strategy 

continue to execute our proven and best‑in‑class retail business strategy we will continue to execute our proven strategies that have generated a history of success and continued growth for us key elements of our strategy include 

• aiming continuously to “wow” the customer with a compelling fun and fresh merchandise assortment comprising a variety of the things you want and things you need all at incredible values in bright clean and friendly stores 

• maintaining a flexible sourcing merchandise model that allows a variety of products to be sold as long as desired merchandise margin thresholds are met 

• growing and improving both the dollar tree and family dollar brands 

• pursuing a “more better faster” approach to the rollout of new dollar tree and family dollar stores to broaden our geographic footprint 

• maintaining customer relevance by ensuring that we reinvent ourselves constantly through new merchandise categories and initiatives 

• leveraging the complementary merchandise expertise of each segment including dollar tree’s sourcing and product development expertise and family dollar’s consumer package goods and national brands sourcing expertise and 

• maintaining a prudent approach with our use of capital for the benefit of our shareholders 

operate a diversified and complementary business model across both fixed ‑ price and multi ‑ price point strategies we plan to operate and grow both the dollar tree and family dollar brands we will utilize the reach and scale of our combined company to serve a broader range of customers in more ways offering better prices and more value for the customer at dollar tree everything is predominantly 100 offering the customer a balanced mix of things they need and things they want our shopping experience will remain fun and friendly as we exceed our customers’ expectations for what they can buy for 100 as noted previously we plan to expand our dollar tree plus initiative into a total of 500 stores beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 merchandise in these stores includes select items which retail for more than 100 but not more than 500 and maintain our customers’ expectations of extreme value dollar tree serves a broad range of income customers in suburban locations family dollar stores will continue to operate using multiple price points serving customers as their “neighborhood discount store” offering great values on everyday items and a convenient shopping experience family dollar primarily serves a lower than average income customer in urban and rural locations we expect to benefit from an expanded target customer profile and utilize the store concepts of both dollar tree and family dollar to serve a broader range of customer demographics to drive further improvements in sales and profitability 

take advantage of significant whitespace opportunity over the past decade we have built a solid and scalable infrastructure which provides a strong foundation for our future growth we are committed to growing our combined business to take advantage of significant market or white space opportunities that we believe exist for both the dollar tree and family dollar store concepts using our proven real estate strategy across our combined business we intend to drive future store openings by capitalizing on data‑driven insights regarding location target customer profile competitive dynamics and cost structure over the longterm we believe that the market can support more than 10000 dollar tree stores and 15000 family dollar stores across the united states and approximately 1000 dollar tree stores in canada 

convenient locations and store size we focus primarily on opening new dollar tree stores in strip shopping centers anchored by large retailers who draw target customers we believe to be similar to ours our stores are successful in metropolitan areas midsized cities and small towns we open new family dollar stores in strip shopping centers freestanding buildings and downtown buildings the range of our new store sizes 8000  10000 selling square feet for dollar tree and 7000  10000 selling square feet 

for family dollar allows us to target a particular location with a store that best suits that market and takes advantage of available real estate opportunities our stores are attractively designed and create an inviting atmosphere for shoppers by using bright lighting vibrant colors and decorative signs we enhance the store design with attractive merchandise displays we believe this design attracts new and repeat customers and enhances our image as both a destination and impulse purchase store 

profitable stores with strong cash flow we maintain a disciplined costsensitive approach to store site selection in order to minimize the initial capital investment required and maximize our potential to generate high operating margins and strong cash flows we believe that our dollar tree stores and our urban family dollar stores have a relatively small shopping radius which allows us to profitably concentrate multiple stores within a single market in addition our rural family dollar stores have a larger shopping radius allowing us to profitably locate in these areas because of our ability to reach customers who live farther from our stores our ability to open new stores is dependent upon among other factors locating suitable sites and negotiating favorable lease terms 

the strong cash flows generated by our stores allow us to selffund infrastructure investment and new stores typically our cash flows from operating activities exceed our capital expenditures 

for more information on our results of operations see “ item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” 

merchandising cost control  we believe that our substantial buying power and our flexibility in making sourcing decisions contributes to our successful purchasing strategy which includes targeted merchandise margin goals by category we also believe our ability to negotiate with our vendor partners allows us to minimize the margin impact of economic pressures such as tariffs we buy products on an orderbyorder basis and have no material longterm purchase contracts or other assurances of continued product supply or guaranteed product cost historically no vendor has accounted for more than 10 of total merchandise purchased by us 

our supply chain systems continue to provide us with valuable sales information to assist our buyers and improve merchandise allocation to our stores we use this information to target our inventory levels in our distribution centers and stores in order to plan for capacity and labor needs 

information systems we believe that investments in technology help us to increase sales and control costs our inventory management system provides information to calculate our estimate of inventory cost under the retail inventory method which is widely used in the retail industry our automated replenishment system replenishes key items based on actual storelevel sales and inventory 

pointofsale data allows us to track sales and inventory by merchandise category at the store level and assists us in planning for future purchases of inventory we believe that this information allows us to ship the appropriate product to stores at the quantities commensurate with selling patterns using this pointofsale data to plan purchases has helped us manage our inventory levels 

corporate culture and values we believe that honesty and integrity and treating people fairly and with respect are core values within our corporate culture we believe that running a business and certainly a public company carries with it a responsibility to be above reproach when making operational and financial decisions our executive management team visits and shops at our stores like every customer and ideas and individual creativity on the part of our associates are encouraged particularly from our store managers who know their stores and their customers we have standards for store displays merchandise presentation and store operations we maintain an open door policy for all associates our distribution centers are operated based on objective measures of performance and virtually everyone in our store support centers is available to assist associates in our stores and distribution centers 

during 2020 we launched an enterprise executive diversity council comprised of diverse leaders from every department within the company who are charged with creating a diversity equity and inclusion “dei” strategy which is linked with our business goals catalyzing cultural change throughout the organization and driving accountability at the senior management level for progress on key dei objectives 

our disclosure committee meets at least quarterly and monitors our internal controls over financial reporting to ensure that our public filings contain discussions about the potential risks our business faces we believe that we have appropriate controls in place to be able to certify our financial statements additionally we have complied with the listing requirements for the nasdaq global select market 

seasonality for information on the impact of seasonality see “ item 1a risk factors ” and “ item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” 

growth strategy 

store openings relocations and square footage growth the primary factors contributing to our net sales growth have been new store openings and an active store relocation expansion and remodel program in the last five years net sales increased at a compound annual growth rate of 53 during this time our store count and approximate selling square footage increased from 

13851 and 1084 million square feet at january 30 2016 to 15685 and 1251 million square feet at january 30 2021 we expect that the majority of our future sales growth will come from new store openings in our dollar tree and family dollar segments and our store expansion and relocation program as well as our renovation initiatives 

our growth and productivity statistics are reported based on selling square footage because our management believes the use of selling square footage yields a more accurate measure of store productivity we expect to increase the selling square footage in our stores in the future by opening new stores in underserved markets and strategically increasing our presence in our existing markets via new store openings and store expansions expansions include store relocations in fiscal 2021 and beyond we plan to predominantly open dollar tree stores that are approximately 8000  10000 selling square feet and family dollar stores that are approximately 7000  10000 selling square feet we believe these store sizes allow us to achieve our objectives in the markets in which we plan to expand 

in addition to new store openings we plan to continue our dollar tree and family dollar store relocation and expansion program to increase our net sales per store and take advantage of market opportunities we target stores for expansion based on the current sales per selling square foot and changes in market opportunities stores targeted for expansion are generally less than 7000 selling square feet in size store expansions generally increase the existing store size by approximately 2500 selling square feet at january 30 2021 6591 of our dollar tree stores totaling approximately 88 of our dollar tree segment selling square footage were 7000 selling square feet or larger 

since 1995 we have added a total of 695 stores through several mergers and acquisitions excluding our acquisition of family dollar historically our acquisition strategy has been to target companies that have a similar single price point concept that have shown success in operations or companies that provide a strategic advantage we evaluate potential acquisition opportunities as they become available in 2015 we completed our acquisition of family dollar which allowed us to create a diversified company with complementary business models 

from time to time we also acquire the rights to store leases through bankruptcy or other proceedings we will continue to take advantage of these opportunities as they arise depending upon several factors including their fit within our location and selling square footage size parameters 

merchandising and distribution expanding our customer base is important to our growth plans we plan to continue to stock our stores with a compelling mix of everchanging merchandise that our customers have come to appreciate consumable merchandise typically leads to more frequent return trips to our stores resulting in increased sales the presentation and display of merchandise in our stores are critical to communicating value to our customers and creating a more exciting shopping experience we believe our approach to visual merchandising results in higher sales volume and an environment that encourages impulse purchases we leverage our merchandising team to source products that can be sold in both dollar tree and family dollar stores our family dollar h2 stores include 100 sections of dollar tree merchandise and our dollar tree plus stores sell items at the 100 300 and 500 price points 

a strong and efficient distribution network is critical to our ability to grow and to maintain a lowcost operating structure in fiscal 2020 we completed construction of our rosenberg texas automated distribution center which is 12 million square feet and currently serves stores in our dollar tree segment additionally in fiscal 2020 we completed construction of a 05 million square foot distribution center in ocala florida and we began shipping product from this facility during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 we expect to complete an expansion of the ocala florida distribution center in 2023 new distribution sites are strategically located to reduce stem miles maintain flexibility and improve efficiency in our store service areas 

we currently operate 26 distribution centers in the united states 15 of which are primarily dedicated to serving our dollar tree stores and 11 distribution centers primarily serve our family dollar stores our st george utah distribution center which is a legacy family dollar facility services both dollar tree and family dollar stores and we expect future distribution centers to be built with the capability to service both dollar tree and family dollar stores 

our distribution network supports multiple store formats including h2 combination stores and dollar tree plus we ship to our h2 format stores from our family dollar distribution centers and we ship to our dollar tree plus format stores from our dollar tree distribution centers we ship to our combination stores from both dollar tree and family dollar distribution centers we believe our distribution center network is currently capable of supporting approximately 302 billion in annual sales in the united states we also are party to an agreement which provides distribution services from two facilities in canada 

our dollar tree stores receive approximately 90 of their inventory from our distribution centers via contract carriers and our family dollar stores receive approximately 74 of their inventory from our distribution centers the remaining store inventory primarily perishable consumable items and other vendormaintained display items are delivered directly to our stores from vendors our family dollar stores receive approximately 13 of their merchandise from mclane company inc for more information on our distribution center network see “ item 2 properties ” 

competition 

our segment of the retail industry is fragmented and highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future we operate in the discount retail sector which is currently and is expected to continue to be highly competitive with respect to price store location merchandise quality assortment and presentation and customer service including merchandise delivery and checkout options our competitors include singleprice dollar stores multiprice dollar stores mass merchandisers online retailers discount retailers drug stores convenience stores independentlyoperated discount stores grocery stores and a wide variety of other retailers in addition several competitors have sections within their stores devoted to “one dollar” price point merchandise which further increases competition we believe we differentiate ourselves from other retailers by providing highvalue highquality lowcost merchandise in attractivelydesigned stores that are conveniently located our sales and profits could be reduced by increases in competition there are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector 

government regulation 

we are subject to a wide variety of local state and federal laws and regulations within the united states and canada compliance with these laws and regulations often requires the dedication of our associates’ time and attention as well as financial resources in fiscal 2020 compliance with these laws and regulations did not have a material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 

human capital resources 

our business success is built upon our dedicated passionate and diverse associates who work and live in the communities we serve our associates share our corporate values “attitude judgment and commitment” we recruit and hire in these communities using local job fairs social media as well as local community service partners to provide parttime and fulltime jobs that can become lasting careers our human resources team with oversight from our board of directors and their committees develops and executes programs for compensation and benefits onboarding and training professional development performance management retention and succession planning we strive to create and maintain a safe working environment for our associates we consider our relationship with our associates to be good and have not experienced significant interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements we greatly value our people and invest in their personal wellbeing and professional growth through various human capital programs and initiatives including the following 

• compensation and benefits we are committed to providing marketcompetitive pay for all positions and we are a payforperformance organization offering performancebased compensation opportunities at nearly all levels of the organization including hourlypaid positions we strive to ensure gender and racial pay equity for employees performing equal or substantially similar work fulltime associates can participate in our retirement savings plan which provides a dollar for dollar match on the first 5 of employee contributions and all associates can participate in our employee stock purchase plan all fulltime and parttime associates are eligible for competitive health and welfare benefits including medical dental vision disability life insurance and other benefits 

• health wellness and family resources in addition to making health and welfare benefits available to our associates we also support our associates and members of their household through our employee assistance program which includes financial and legal services as well as expert counsel in areas such as parenting family issues and resilience skills we offer primary caregiver and parental leave to support our associates while they are starting or growing their families and we have a program that provides financial support to associates recovering from natural disasters and personal hardships to support our associates with high schoolaged children we recently launched a scholarship program to provide access to financial support in their pursuit of higher education 

• talent development we believe in the growth and development of our associates and provide a multitude of professional and leadership development experiences including online and instructorled trainings that enable associates to consume relevant learning content for their current role and future career growth to remove barriers to education we recently launched an education assistance program that provides tuition reimbursement as well as discounted tuition at over 200 colleges and universities for our associates and their families our associates also receive personalized coaching and advisement on degree programs that meet their needs retention of our associates is a focus for all leaders and we continue to strive to improve our turnover rate we monitor associate turnover as we know our success depends on retaining and engaging talent in all areas of the business to identify highpotential talent leadership assesses talent at the store manager level and above on a regular basis through structured talent reviews and succession planning paired with customized development plans this focus on talent has resulted in more than 35600 promotions in 2020 

• diversity equity and inclusion we believe our associates should mirror our diverse customer base and the communities we serve in 2020 we launched an enterprise executive diversity council comprised of diverse leaders from every department within the company who are charged with creating a dei strategy which is linked with our business goals catalyzing cultural change throughout the organization and driving accountability at the senior management level for 

progress on key dei objectives 

as of january 30 2021 we employed more than 199300 associates as follows 



parttime associates work an average of less than 30 hours per week and the number of parttime associates fluctuates depending on seasonal needs 

covid19 response we implemented several changes to protect our associates and our customers in response to the covid19 pandemic and to ensure adherence to centers for disease control and prevention cdc recommendations we provided personal protective equipment including masks gloves and sanitizers for our store and distribution center associates installed plexiglass sneeze guards at all store registers and enabled the majority of our store support center teams to work remotely we provided wage premiums for store and distribution center hourly associates provided minimum guaranteed sales bonuses for store managers and pay continuation for associates who tested positive for covid19 for additional information on the steps taken to support our associates in response to the covid19 pandemic refer to “ item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” 




 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk any failure to meet market expectations including our comparable store sales growth rate earnings and earnings per share or new store openings could cause the market price of our stock to decline you should carefully consider the specific risk factors listed below together with all other information included or incorporated in this report and other filings that we make from time to time with the sec including our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes however the risks and uncertainties that we face are not limited to those described below and those set forth in our sec filings additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also arise in such event our business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected 

profitability and operational risks 

our profitability is vulnerable to cost increases 

future increases in costs such as wage and benefit costs ocean shipping rates domestic freight costs fuel and energy costs the cost of merchandise duties and tariffs merchandise loss due to theft damage or errors and store occupancy costs would reduce our profitability without respect to covid19related premium pay we expect material increases in wage rates and labor costs as well as in shipping rates freight and fuel costs in 2021 certain states and localities have passed laws to increase the minimum wage beginning in 2021 and are considering “hero pay” ie laws that would require increasing the pay of certain associates if we remain open when certain pandemic restrictions are implemented in addition the us congress is considering whether to pass national minimum wage increases in 2021 and the current administration may consider raising the minimum salary for store managers who have exempt status under the fair labor standards act separately government or industry actions addressing the impact of climate change may result in increases in merchandise or operating costs 

in our dollar tree segment we do not raise the sales price of our merchandise to offset cost increases because we are committed to selling primarily at the 100 price point to continue to provide value to the customer we are dependent on our ability to adjust our product assortment to operate more efficiently or to increase our comparable store net sales in order to offset cost increases we can give no assurance that we will be able to operate more efficiently or increase our comparable store net sales in the future although family dollar unlike dollar tree can raise the price of merchandise customers may buy fewer products if prices were to increase please see “ item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” for further discussion of the effect of economic factors on our operations 

if the covid19 pandemic worsens or continues longer than expected there could be a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

in march 2020 the world health organization declared a pandemic arising from a novel strain of coronavirus and its related disease known as covid19 nations and governments at every level responded with significant actions to attempt to mitigate the public health crisis and the impact of the pandemic on the economy the continuing covid19 pandemic and related public health measures have caused economic disruptions that have adversely affected and are expected to continue to adversely affect elements of our business we have however been classified as an essential business and been allowed to remain open but our operational costs have increased significantly because of covid19 to date sales at family dollar have increased during the pandemic however sales at dollar tree have been adversely affected especially in our party departments and for easter in 2020 and as a result of fewer customer trips in certain consumable departments such as snacks and candy 

there continues to be uncertainty and unpredictability about the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our financial and operating results in future periods if the pandemic worsens or continues longer than expected governments may reinstate or extend business or personal restrictions and we could be forced to curtail or restrict operations or incur additional costs certain states and localities are considering laws that would require increasing the pay of store associates if we remain open when certain covid19 restrictions are implemented we might also experience new disruptions in our supply chain and sources of supply suffer facility closures or encounter difficulties in hiring or retaining the workforce required for our business these circumstances if applicable for an extended duration or across significant parts of our operating footprint could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

the covid19 pandemic and public health measures have already contributed to among other things 

• increases in the cost of operating our stores and distribution centers including temporarily higher wages and bonuses paid to associates enhanced cleaning protocols and the cost of personal protection equipment 

• disruptions in the patterns of consumer demand which has led to among other things decreased demand for party merchandise and during 2020 easter merchandise in the dollar tree segment an increase in consumer demand for household cleaning and other essential supplies and corresponding difficulty in our ability to maintain those items in stock 

fluctuations in demand for discretionary products and an increase in demand for online sales which is an insignificant part of our business and home which we recently began providing in the family dollar segment or curbside deliveries which we do not offer 

• decreasing foot traffic in our stores as a result of the promotion of social distancing the adoption of various governmental restrictions on personal and business activities and changing consumer attitudes with respect to inperson shopping and changes in shopping patterns 

reduced consumer demand for holiday seasonal party and other discretionary products that generally carry a higher margin may have a negative impact on our gross profit margin especially in the later part of the year when they typically form a larger part of our merchandise mix it is uncertain what effect the covid19 pandemic will have on holiday merchandise sales in the future also other sales have decreased in the past and may decrease in the future when covid19 infection rates spike 

our business and results of operations could be materially harmed if we experience a decline in consumer confidence and spending as a result of continued unfavorable economic conditions for example because government assistance to households and businesses terminate or are reduced 

governmental authorities have adopted substantial measures including fiscal and monetary stimulus to provide economic assistance to individual households and businesses and support economic stability during the covid19 pandemic and the related recession and increase in unemployment we believe the economic intervention that occurred in fiscal 2020 benefited our sales while the enactment of the american rescue plan act of 2021 on march 11 2021 is expected to provide additional economic assistance to individual households and businesses there can be no assurance that current or future governmental efforts to support the economy during the pandemic will be sufficient to mitigate the negative effect of the pandemic on the economy if consumer spending on the goods we sell declines as a result there could be a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

we are unable to predict the full extent to which the covid19 pandemic will affect the economy and our customers associates suppliers vendors other business partners or our business results of operations and financial condition if the economic consequences of the pandemic are prolonged andor worsen it could amplify many of the other risks described in this form 10k 

we may continue to encounter higher costs and disruptions in our distribution network 

our success is dependent on our ability to import or transport merchandise to our distribution centers and then truck merchandise to our stores in a timely and costeffective manner we rely heavily on third parties including ocean shippers and truckers in that process we may not anticipate respond to or control all of the challenges of operating our distribution network additionally when a shipping or trucking line fails to deliver on its commitments or our distribution centers fail to operate effectively we could experience increased freight costs or merchandise shortages that could lead to lost sales we are experiencing ocean shipping disruptions trucking shortages increased ocean shipping rates and increased trucking and fuel costs in the last several years we have incurred higher distribution costs due to a variety of factors some of the factors that could have an adverse effect on our distribution network or costs in 2021 are 

• shipping disruptions  there is currently a shortage of shipping containers in china and other parts of asia and as a result we are experiencing significant delays in importing our goods we are also experiencing issues with port congestion our shipping schedules and shipping capacity may be further disrupted or delayed as a result of these or other factors although these delays have not yet impacted our sales and we believe we are adequately stocked with merchandise for easter the delays could potentially have a material adverse impact on our sales after easter especially at dollar tree if the delays do not improve the global covid19 pandemic is also expected to continue to present a risk to transpacific shipping in 2021 and may affect shipping from china where we buy a significant portion of our merchandise our supply chain may be disrupted as a result of the pandemic as well as other international events such as war or acts of terrorism 

• shipping costs  we are experiencing increases in shipping rates from the transpacific ocean carriers we are currently projecting approximately 800 to 1000 million of additional costs in fiscal 2021 as a result of higher shipping and domestic freight costs changes in import duties import quotas and other trade sanctions could also increase our costs 

• efficient operations and management  distribution centers and other aspects of our distribution network are difficult to operate efficiently and we have and could experience a reduction in operating efficiency as a result of high turnover and challenges in maintaining a stable workforce especially if the covid19 crisis continues 

• diesel fuel costs  we have experienced volatility in diesel fuel costs over the past few years and are expecting increases this year 

• trucking costs  we have experienced significant increases in trucking costs in recent years due to the truck driver shortage and other factors and our trucking costs are expected to increase in the future 

• vulnerability to natural or manmade disasters including climate change  a fire explosion or natural disaster at a port or any of our distribution facilities could result in a loss of merchandise and impair our ability to adequately stock our stores some facilities are vulnerable to earthquakes hurricanes tornadoes or floods and an increase in the severity and frequency of extreme weather events may increase our operating costs or disrupt our supply chain 

• labor disagreement  labor disagreements disruptions or strikes for example at ports may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our distribution centers or stores and increase costs 

• mclane company inc  in fiscal 2020 we purchased and delivered approximately 13 of our merchandise for our family dollar segment through our relationship with mclane company inc which distributes consumable merchandise from multiple manufacturers a disruption in our relationship with mclane company inc could have a significant nearterm impact on our operations 

risks associated with our domestic and foreign suppliers including tariffs or restrictions on trade or disruptions arising from the covid19 pandemic could adversely affect our financial performance 

we are dependent on our vendors to supply merchandise in a timely and efficient manner if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments due to financial or other difficulties we could experience merchandise shortages which could lead to lost sales or increased merchandise costs if alternative sources must be used 

we rely on the availability of imported goods at favorable wholesale prices merchandise imported directly accounts for approximately 38 to 40 of our dollar tree segment’s total retail value purchases and 15 to 17 of our family dollar segment’s total retail value purchases in addition we believe that a significant portion of our goods purchased from domestic vendors is imported imported goods are generally less expensive than domestic goods and increase our profit margins a disruption in the flow of our imported merchandise or an increase in the cost of those goods may significantly decrease our profits risks associated with our reliance on imported goods may include disruptions in the flow of or increases in the cost of imported goods because of factors such as 

• duties tariffs or other restrictions on trade including section 301 tariffs that have already been imposed on imported chinese goods and it is unclear whether the current presidential administration will support rolling back these tariffs we are currently expecting the amount of section 301 tariffs we pay in 2021 to increase above 2020 levels because the amount of our imports is expected to increase and we expect to pay tariffs on products which were temporarily excluded from tariffs during 2020 

• raw material shortages work stoppages government travel restrictions strikes and political unrest including any impact on vendors or shipping arising from epidemics and related travel restrictions such as the recent covid19 pandemic 

• economic crises and international disputes or conflicts 

• changes in currency exchange rates or policies and local economic conditions including inflation including energy prices and raw material costs in the country of origin 

• potential changes to or withdrawal of the united states from international trade agreements or the failure of the united states to maintain normal trade relations with china and other countries 

• changes in leadership and the political climate in countries from which we import products and their relations with the united states and 

• failure of manufacturers outside the united states to meet food drug and cosmetic safety and labeling requirements or environmental standards set by government regulators or consumer expectations 

see “ item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” for further discussion of the effect of foreign suppliers on our operations 

our supply chain may be disrupted by changes in united states trade policy with china 

we rely on domestic and foreign suppliers to provide us with merchandise in a timely manner and at favorable prices among our foreign suppliers china is the source of a substantial majority of our imports a disruption in the flow of our imported merchandise from china or an increase in the cost of those goods may significantly decrease our profits 

the united states has scaled back punitive section 301 tariffs on certain chinese imports based on an agreement reached with china in 2020 however there is uncertainty as to the actions that may be taken under the current presidential administration with respect to us trade policy with china including whether the administration will support reductions in tariffs the imposition of any new us tariffs on chinese imports or the taking of other actions against china in the future and any responses by china could 

impair our ability to meet customer demand and could result in lost sales or an increase in our cost of merchandise which would have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

our growth is dependent on our ability to increase sales in existing stores and to expand our square footage profitably 

existing store sales growth is critical to good operating results and is dependent on a variety of factors including merchandise quality relevance and availability store operations and customer satisfaction in addition increased competition could adversely affect our sales failure to meet our sales targets including in our renovated stores could result in our needing to record material noncash impairment charges related to our intangible assets we believe improving sales at family dollar depends in significant part on the success of the h2 renovations and other new store concepts 

our highest sales periods are during the christmas and easter seasons and we generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and our operating and net income during the fourth quarter in anticipation we stock extra inventory and hire many temporary employees to prepare our stores a reduction in sales during these periods could adversely affect our operating results particularly operating and net income to a greater extent than if a reduction occurred at other times of the year untimely merchandise delays due to receiving or distribution problems could have a similar effect 

when easter is observed earlier in the year the selling season is shorter and as a result our sales could be adversely affected easter was observed on april 12 2020 and will be observed on april 4 2021 

expanding our square footage profitably depends on a number of uncertainties including our ability to locate lease build out and open or expand stores in suitable locations on a timely basis under favorable economic terms obtaining an increasing number of profitable stores is an everincreasing challenge in addition our expansion is dependent upon thirdparty developers’ abilities to acquire land obtain financing and secure necessary permits and approvals we also open or expand stores within our established geographic markets where new or expanded stores may draw sales away from our existing stores we may not manage our expansion effectively and our failure to achieve our expansion plans could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our profitability is affected by the mix of products we sell 

our gross profit margin decreases when we increase the proportion of higher cost goods we sell imported merchandise is generally lower cost than domestic goods our supply of goods including imported goods could be negatively impacted by the covid19 pandemic in recent years the percentage of our sales from higher cost consumable products has increased and we can give no assurance that this trend will not continue 

in our family dollar segment our success also depends on our ability to select and obtain sufficient quantities of relevant merchandise at prices that allow us to sell such merchandise at profitable and appropriate prices a sales price that is too high causes products to be less attractive to our customers and our sales at family dollar could suffer we are continuing to refine our pricing strategy at family dollar to drive customer loyalty and have a strategic pricing team to improve our value and to increase profitability inability to successfully implement our pricing strategies at family dollar could have a negative effect on our business 

in addition our family dollar segment has a substantial number of private brand items and the number of items has been increasing we believe our success in maintaining broad market acceptance of our private brands depends on many factors including our pricing costs quality and customer perception we may not achieve or maintain our expected sales for our private brands and as a result our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted additionally the increased number of private brands could negatively impact our existing relationships with our nonprivate brand suppliers 

we may stop selling or recall certain products for safetyrelated issues 

we may stop selling or recall certain products produced by certain manufacturers for safetyrelated issues including product contamination product content such as lead spoilage or other adulteration improper manufacturing processes improper testing product mislabeling or product tampering for example we may stop selling or recall products if the products or operations of our suppliers violate applicable laws or regulations including food drug and cosmetic safety laws or when our suppliers’ products cause injury illness or death in addition our marketing of adulterated products could subject us to claims of false or deceptive advertising or other criticism a significant product liability or other legal judgment against us a related regulatory enforcement action or a widespread product recall could materially and adversely affect our reputation and results of operations moreover even if a product liability consumer fraud or other claim is unsuccessful has no merit or is not pursued the negative publicity surrounding assertions against the products we sell could materially and adversely affect our business reputation and profitability 

pressure from competitors may reduce our sales and profits 

the retail industry is highly competitive the marketplace is highly fragmented as many different retailers compete for market share by utilizing a variety of store formats and merchandising strategies including mobile and online shopping we expect 

competition to increase in the future there are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector some of our current or potential competitors have greater financial resources than we do we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors or that doing so will not require substantial capital expenditures please see “ item 1 business ” for further discussion of the effect of competition on our operations 

a downturn or adverse change in economic conditions could impact our sales or profitability 

a deterioration in economic conditions whether related to the covid19 pandemic or otherwise could reduce consumer spending or cause customers to shift their spending to products we either do not sell or do not sell as profitably adverse economic conditions could disrupt consumer spending and significantly reduce our sales decrease our inventory turnover cause greater markdowns or reduce our profitability due to lower margins other factors that could result in or exacerbate adverse economic conditions include a prolonged or deep recession inflation higher unemployment consumer debt levels trade disputes as well as adverse climate or weather conditions epidemics terrorism or international conflict 

furthermore factors that could adversely affect consumer disposable income could decrease our customers’ spending on products we sell factors that could reduce our customers’ disposable income and over which we exercise no influence include but are not limited to the pandemic and other adverse economic conditions described above as well as increases in fuel or other energy costs and interest rates lack of available credit higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws increasing healthcare costs and changes in decreases in or elimination of government subsidies such as unemployment and food assistance programs 

many of the factors identified above that affect disposable income as well as commodity rates transportation costs including the costs of diesel fuel costs of labor insurance and healthcare foreign exchange rate fluctuations lease costs barriers or increased costs associated with international trade and other economic factors also affect our ability to implement our corporate strategy effectively our cost of goods sold and our selling general and administrative expenses and may have other adverse consequences which we are unable to fully anticipate or control all of which may adversely affect our sales or profitability we have limited or no ability to control many of these factors 

our business could be adversely affected if we fail to attract and retain qualified associates and key personnel 

our growth and performance is dependent on the skills experience and contributions of our associates executives and key personnel for both dollar tree and family dollar various factors including the ongoing pandemic integration of our segments constraints on overall labor availability wage rates regulatory or legislative impacts and benefit costs could impact our ability to attract and retain qualified associates at our stores distribution centers and corporate offices 

risks relating to strategic initiatives 

we may not be successful in implementing important strategic initiatives which may have an adverse impact on our business and financial results 

we have adopted important strategic initiatives that are designed to create growth improve our results of operations and drive longterm shareholder value including 

• our plans relating to new store openings for dollar tree and family dollar 

• the continued integration of the operations of family dollar with dollar tree 

• the renovation of family dollar stores to the h2 format 

• the testing and implementation of a multiprice initiative in dollar tree stores referred to as dollar tree plus  

• the introduction of selected dollar tree merchandise into family dollar stores and 

• the testing and rollout of a new store format that combines a dollar tree store and family dollar store in a single location 

the implementation of these strategic initiatives are subject to various risks and uncertainties including consumer acceptance of new store concepts and merchandise offerings construction and permitting delays relating to new and renovated stores the success of our integration strategies the availability of desirable real estate locations for lease at reasonable rates the impact of the covid19 pandemic and other factors beyond our control in addition several of these initiatives depend on the continued success of our integration of family dollar merchandising supply chain and operations with those of dollar tree there can be no assurance that we will be able to implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations or that they will generate expected returns which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results 

we could incur losses due to impairment of longlived assets goodwill and intangible assets 

under us generally accepted accounting principles we review our longlived assets for impairment whenever economic events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable identifiable intangible assets with an indefinite useful life including goodwill are not amortized but are evaluated annually for impairment a more frequent evaluation is performed if events or circumstances indicate that impairment could have occurred 

in fiscal 2019 and 2018 we recorded a 3130 million and a 273 billion noncash pretax and aftertax goodwill impairment charge respectively related to our family dollar reporting unit these impairments were a result of business challenges including slower sales growth higher freight shrink and store labor costs should we experience similar business challenges or significant negative industry or general economic trends we could recognize additional impairments to our goodwill intangible assets and other longlived assets we monitor key assumptions and other factors utilized in our goodwill impairment analysis and if business or other market conditions develop that are materially different than we currently anticipate we will conduct an additional impairment evaluation any reduction in or impairment of the value of goodwill or intangible assets will result in a charge against earnings which could have a material adverse impact on our reported results of operations and financial condition for additional information on goodwill impairments please refer to note 3 to our consolidated financial statements 

cybersecurity and technology risks 

we rely on computer and technology systems in our operations and any material failure inadequacy interruption or security failure of those systems including because of a cyberattack could harm our ability to effectively operate and grow our business and could adversely affect our financial results 

we rely extensively on our computer and technology systems and in certain cases those of thirdparty service providers to manage inventory process credit card and customer transactions and summarize results our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the distribution and sale of our merchandise depends significantly on the confidentiality integrity and availability of these systems and on our ability to successfully integrate the dollar tree and family dollar systems we also rely on thirdparty providers and platforms for some of these computer and technology systems and support 

although we have operational safeguards in place they may not be effective in preventing the failure of these systems or platforms to operate effectively and be available to us this may be as the result of deliberate breach in the security of these systems or platforms by bad actors including through malicious software ransomware and other cyberattacks failures may also be caused by various other factors including power outages catastrophic events physical theft computer and network failures inadequate or ineffective redundancy problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or platforms flaws in thirdparty software or services errors or improper use by our employees or third party service providers 

if these systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process customer transactions and may receive negative publicity which could adversely affect our results of operations and business in addition remediation of any problems with our systems could take an extensive amount of time and could result in significant unplanned expenses 

the potential unauthorized access to customer information may violate privacy laws and could damage our business reputation subject us to negative publicity litigation and costs and adversely affect our results of operations or business 

many of our information technology systems such as those we use for our pointofsale web and mobile platforms including online and mobile payment systems and for administrative functions including human resources payroll accounting and internal and external communications contain personal financial or other confidential information that is entrusted to us by our customers and associates as well as proprietary and other confidential information related to our business and suppliers 

we have procedures and technology in place to safeguard our customers’ personal information including debit and credit card information our associates’ private data suppliers’ data and our business records and intellectual property and other sensitive information despite these measures we have experienced attempted and ongoing cyberattacks which are rapidly evolving perpetrators who may include wellfunded state actors are becoming increasingly sophisticated and difficult to detect we andor our third party suppliers may be vulnerable to and unable to anticipate detect and appropriately respond to such cybersecurity attacks including data security breaches and data loss 

we are subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions in which we operate regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data for example the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which became effective on january 1 2020 imposes responsibilities on us for the handling disclosure and deletion of personal information for consumers who reside in california the ccpa permits california to assess potentially significant fines for violating ccpa and creates a right for individuals to bring class action suits seeking damages for violations our efforts to comply with ccpa and other privacy and data protection laws may impose significant 

costs and challenges that are likely to increase over time and we could incur substantial penalties or be subject to litigation related to violation of existing or future data privacy laws and regulations 

likewise we are subject to the payment card industry data security standards “pcidss” which is mandated by the card brands and administered through the payment card industry security standards council failure to meet requirements and maintain compliance could result in a loss of credibility or reputation and our inability to continue to accept credit cards as a tender type materially impacting our ability to sell our products there exists the potential to have recurring and accumulating fines levied against us as a result of not meeting compliance until compliance is achieved considerable investments to strengthen our information security could also be required should we ever be deemed to be noncompliant as a level 1 merchant we are subject to assessment and attestation for pcidss compliance on an annual basis 

in addition our reputation within the business community and with our customers may be affected which could result in our customers discontinuing the use of debit or credit cards in our stores or not shopping in our stores altogether 

moreover significant capital investments and other expenditures could also be required to remedy cybersecurity problems and prevent future security breaches including costs associated with additional security technologies personnel experts and services eg creditmonitoring services for those whose data has been breached these costs which could be material could adversely impact our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred and may not meaningfully limit the success of future attempts to breach our information technology systems 

the unavailability of our information technology systems or the failure of those systems or software to perform as anticipated for any reason and any inability to respond to or recover from such an event could disrupt our business decrease performance and increase overhead costs if we are unable to secure our customers’ credit card and confidential information or other private data relating to our associates suppliers or our business we could be subject to negative publicity costly government enforcement actions or private litigation and increased costs any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or business 

legal and regulatory risks 

litigation and arbitration may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to the risk of litigation and arbitration involving employees consumers suppliers competitors shareholders government agencies or others through private actions class actions governmental investigations administrative proceedings regulatory actions mass arbitration or other similar actions our products could also cause illness or injury harm our reputation and subject us to litigation we are dependent on our vendors to ensure that the products we buy comply with all applicable safety standards however product liability personal injury or other claims may be asserted against us relating to product contamination product tampering mislabeling recall and other safety issues with respect to the products that we sell we seek but may not be successful in obtaining contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from our vendors and if we do not have adequate contractual indemnification or insurance available such product liability or safety claims could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations our ability to obtain the benefit of contractual indemnification from foreign vendors may be hindered by our ability to enforce contractual indemnification obligations against such vendors our litigationrelated expenses could increase as well which also could have a materially negative impact on our results of operations even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued 

the outcome of such matters is difficult to assess or quantify plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits or proceedings may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss may remain unknown for substantial periods of time in addition certain of these matters if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in an expense that may be material to our financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operations are required the cost to defend current and future litigation or proceedings including arbitrations may be significant there also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation including litigation related to product or food safety customer information and environmental or safety requirements which could negatively affect customer perception of our business regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable 

for a discussion of current legal matters please see “ item 3 legal proceedings ” and note 5 to our consolidated financial statements under the caption “contingencies” resolution of these matters if decided against us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations accrued liabilities or cash flows 

changes in laws and government regulations or our failure to adequately estimate the impact of such changes could increase our expenses expose us to legal risks or otherwise adversely affect us 

our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations and changes to those laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business in 2021 the new presidential administration and congress are expected to have public policy positions and 

legislative priorities that are significantly different than the positions and priorities of the prior presidential administration including among other things such matters as climate change and sustainability wage and labor laws health care tax policy and less focus on deregulation the possible enactment of new environmental laws and regulations and potential new carbon taxes or energy efficiency standards could increase our costs in addition certain states and local governments have passed laws to increase the minimum wage beginning in 2021 and the minimum wage may increase nationally depending on the outcome of future legislation proposed in congress 

significant legislative changes in laws or regulations that impact our relationship with our workforce such as minimum wage increases “hero pay” health care labor laws or workplace safety could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations changes in other regulatory areas such as consumer credit privacy and information security product and food safety energy or environmental protection among others could cause our expenses to increase or product recalls in addition if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations including wage and hour laws we could be subject to legal risk including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation which could adversely affect our results of operations 

risks relating to indebtedness 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition limit our ability to obtain additional financing restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures 

as of january 30 2021 our total indebtedness is 325 billion in addition we have 125 billion of additional borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility less amounts outstanding for letters of credit totaling 987 million 

our level of debt could have significant consequences including the following 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other general corporate purposes 

• requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 

• limiting our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all 

• imposing restrictive covenants on our operations 

• placing us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors carrying less debt and 

• making us more vulnerable to economic downturns and limiting our ability to withstand competitive pressures 

in addition our credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and accordingly our cost of capital our ratings reflect the opinions of the ratings agencies of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations there can be no assurance that we will achieve a particular rating or maintain a particular rating in the future 

the terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness may restrict our current and future operations and could adversely affect our capital resources financial condition and liquidity 

the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interests in addition certain of these agreements require us to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants our ability to satisfy these financial maintenance covenants can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot assure you that we will meet them  

a breach of the covenants under these agreements could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness which if not cured or waived could result in us having to repay our borrowings before their due dates such default may allow the debt holders to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies if we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or if we were to experience difficulty in refinancing the debt prior to maturity our results of operations or financial condition could be materially affected in addition an event of default under our credit facilities may permit the lenders under our credit facilities to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under such credit facilities in the event our lenders or holders of notes accelerate the repayment of such borrowings we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay such indebtedness 

as a result of these restrictions we may be 

• limited in how we conduct our business 

• unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns or 

• unable to compete effectively take advantage of new business opportunities or grow in accordance with our plans 

risks relating to our common stock 

our business or the value of our common stock could be negatively affected as a result of actions by activist shareholders 

we value constructive input from investors and regularly engage in dialogue with our shareholders regarding strategy and performance the board of directors and management team are committed to acting in the best interests of all of our shareholders there is no assurance that the actions taken by the board of directors and management in seeking to maintain constructive engagement with our shareholders will be successful activist shareholders who disagree with our strategy or the way we are managed have sought to effect change and may seek to effect change in the future through various strategies that range from private engagement to publicity campaigns proxy contests efforts to force transactions not supported by the board of directors and litigation 

responding to these actions may be costly and timeconsuming disrupt our operations divert the attention of our board of directors management and employees and interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plan and attract and retain qualified executive leadership a contested election for example could also require us to incur substantial legal and public relations fees and proxy solicitation expenses the perceived uncertainty as to our future direction resulting from activist strategies could also affect the market price and volatility of our common stock 

the price of our common stock is subject to market and other conditions and may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors these factors some of which may be beyond our control include the perceived prospects and actual results of operations of our business changes in estimates of our results of operations by analysts investors or us trading activity by our large shareholders trading activity by sophisticated algorithms highfrequency trading our actual results of operations relative to estimates or expectations actions or announcements by us or our competitors litigation and judicial decisions legislative or regulatory actions or changes and changes in general economic or market conditions in addition the stock market in general has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations these market fluctuations could reduce the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our operating performance 

certain provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws could delay or discourage a change of control transaction that may be in a shareholder’s best interest 

our articles of incorporation and bylaws currently contain provisions that may delay or discourage a takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider in hisher best interest these provisions among other things 

• provide that only the board of directors the chairman of the board or the chief executive officer may call special meetings of the shareholders 

• establish certain advance notice procedures for nominations of candidates for election as directors and for shareholder proposals to be considered at shareholders’ meetings and 

• permit the board of directors without further action of the shareholders to issue and fix the terms of preferred stock which may have rights senior to those of the common stock 

however we believe that these provisions allow our board of directors to negotiate a higher price in the event of a takeover attempt which would be in the best interest of our shareholders

key events and recent developments 

several key events have had or are expected to have a significant effect on our operations they are listed below 

• impact of covid19 

the covid19 pandemic has materially affected and likely will continue to affect our financial condition and results of operations for the foreseeable future as you review the management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations please keep in mind the following 

as an essential business our stores and distribution centers have remained open during the pandemic however our business trends and financial results are materially different than what we expected we estimate that our increased costs related to covid19 for premium pay including bonuses supplies protective equipment and similar items in fiscal 2020 was 2790 million although we believe that the pandemic has resulted in higher sales at family dollar we also believe it has resulted in significantly lower sales at dollar tree during the easter season in 2020 and in our party departments in addition as a result of fewer customer trips sales in certain consumable departments such as snacks and candy have been lower we have experienced fewer customer visits and higher average ticket the mix and profit margin of products being purchased by our customers has been different and has changed during 2020 as demand for essential goods including cleaning supplies and sanitizer household products paper goods food and overthecounter medicine increased to unprecedented levels both our domestic suppliers and distribution centers were stressed to keep up with the demand we expect this disruption with certain vendors and skus to continue into 2021 the effect of covid19related stimulus purchases for some other nonessential items may create additional disruptions 

we have implemented several changes to support our associates in adhering to cdc recommendations we have 

◦ activated our business response team to communicate assess and address potential exposure throughout the organization 

◦ provided personal protective equipment including masks gloves and sanitizers for our store and distribution center associates 

◦ deployed plexiglass sneeze guards for all registers at all stores 

◦ deployed hand sanitizer stands in each of our stores 

◦ equipped stores distribution centers and the store support center with necessary supplies for enhanced cleaning protocol 

◦ provided wage premiums for all store and distribution center hourly associates excluding hourlypaid store managers 

◦ provided minimum guaranteed sales bonuses for each store manager as well as “thank you” bonuses and bonuses for certain salaried associates in our field operations and distribution centers 

◦ provided pay continuation for associates who test positive or who are group 1 associates who have to selfquarantine 

◦ created a “store” within each distribution center to allow our associates to shop for needed supplies at work when supplies were scarce in retail locations 

◦ eliminated all nonessential air travel 

◦ utilized technology options for all large group meetings 

◦ prohibited external visitors’ access to the store support center 

◦ enabled the majority of our store support center teams to work remotely 

◦ enabled contactless payments to our pos systems for our customers 

◦ followed local municipality county and state guidelines and regulations needed to be open as an essential business 

◦ encouraged safe social distancing protocols for our customers with signing graphics and communications 

◦ enabled health prescreening questionnaire for all store and distribution associates before entering work and 

◦ established temperature check protocols for our associates at all distribution centers and the store support center 

given the level of volatility and uncertainty surrounding the future impact of covid19 on our customers suppliers and the broader economies in the locations that we operate as well as uncertainty around the future impact on our supply chain it is challenging to predict our future operations and financial results following is a discussion of the impacts that we have seen and the factors which could influence our future performance 

during march 2020 our dollar tree and family dollar stores began to experience a significant increase in customer demand and sales related to essential products and comparable store net sales increased significantly however beginning the last week of march 2020 and continuing into april during the peak of the easter selling season comparable store net sales at our dollar tree stores decreased beginning in midapril comparable store net sales at our dollar tree stores increased as the comparable easter period from 2019 had passed for fiscal 2020 enterprise comparable store net sales increased 61 resulting from an increase in average ticket of 200 partially offset by decreased traffic of 116 after the easter selling season in both banners we saw an increase in demand for and sales of discretionary products and our seasonal business for the other holidays throughout the year was strong 

the future impact of covid19 on our customers and our business is difficult to predict the course of the pandemic the effectiveness of health measures such as vaccines and the impact of ongoing economic stabilization efforts is uncertain and government assistance payments may not provide enough funding to support current spending the american rescue plan act of 2021 “rescue act” which was enacted on march 11 2021 provides us government funding to address the continuing impact of covid19 on the economy public health individuals and businesses among other things the rescue act provides for 1400 direct payments to individuals continues supplemental unemployment benefits until september 2021 extends a prior increase in food stamp benefits expands the child tax credit and earned income tax credit provides for rent and utility assistance and funds covid19 vaccinations testing treatment and prevention an increase in the federal minimum wage was not included in the rescue act as enacted 

the demand for essential supplies has increased and we are dependent on our suppliers to replenish the goods in our stores disruptions in our supply chain or sources of supply could adversely impact our sales 

our new store openings in fiscal 2020 were affected by construction delays due to challenges with the permitting process during covid19 during 2020 we opened 341 new dollar tree stores and 156 new family dollar stores compared to an original plan of 350 new dollar tree stores and 200 new family dollar stores 

with the increase in customer activity in our family dollar stores and covid19related travel restrictions we paused the rollout of our h2 stores during the first quarter of 2020 we resumed the rollout during the second quarter of 2020 and renovated approximately 770 stores to this format in fiscal 2020 compared with our original plan of 1250 renovations also as a result of covid19related delays in obtaining permits we added adult beverage product to approximately 570 stores in fiscal 2020 compared with our original plan of 1000 

for further discussion of the impacts that covid19 had on our financial condition and results of operations during fiscal 2020 refer to “results of operations” in this item 7 below 

• family dollar 

◦ in 2018 based on our strategic and operational reassessment of the family dollar segment following challenges that the business experienced that impacted our ability to grow the business at the originally estimated rate when we acquired family dollar in 2015 management determined there were indicators that the goodwill of the business may be impaired accordingly a goodwill impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 and we recorded a 273 billion noncash pretax and aftertax goodwill impairment charge the results of our 2019 annual impairment test showed that the fair value of the family dollar reporting unit was lower than its carrying value resulting in a 3130 million noncash pretax and aftertax goodwill impairment charge 

◦ in march 2019 we announced plans for a store optimization program for family dollar for fiscal 2019 this program included rolling out a new model for both new and renovated family dollar stores internally known as h2 rebannering selected stores to the dollar tree brand closing underperforming stores and installing adult beverages and expanding freezers and coolers in selected stores in fiscal 2020 we continued to roll out the h2 

concept to more stores increased the number of stores with adult beverages and expanded freezers and coolers in selected stores and plan to continue these initiatives in fiscal 2021 

◦ in fiscal 2019 we substantially completed our consolidation of our store support centers in matthews north carolina and chesapeake virginia to our summit pointe development in chesapeake virginia 

◦ building on the success of the h2 format we have developed a combination store which leverages both the dollar tree and family dollar brands to serve small towns across the country we are taking family dollar’s great value and assortment and blending in select dollar tree merchandise categories creating a new store format targeted for small towns and rural communities with populations of 3000 to 4000 residents 

• supply chain 

◦ in the third quarter of 2019 we opened a new 12 million square foot distribution center in morrow county ohio 

◦ in the third quarter of 2020 we opened a new 12 million square foot distribution center in rosenberg texas and opened the first phase of our new ocala florida distribution center 

• longterm debt 

◦ during the first quarter of 2018 we redeemed our 7500 million acquisition notes and accelerated the amortization of debtissuance costs associated with the notes of 61 million 

◦ during the first quarter of 2018 we refinanced our longterm debt obligations as follows 

▪ we completed the registered offering of 7500 million of senior floating rate notes due 2020 10 billion of 370 senior notes due 2023 10 billion of 400 senior notes due 2025 and 125 billion of 420 senior notes due 2028 

▪ we entered into a credit agreement for a 7820 million term loan facility and a 125 billion revolving credit facility 

▪ we used the proceeds of the above offerings to repay the 21827 million outstanding under our senior secured credit facilities and redeem the remaining 25 billion outstanding under our acquisition debt resulting in the acceleration of the expensing of 412 million of deferred financing costs and our incurring 1143 million in prepayment penalties 

◦ during the fourth quarter of 2018 we prepaid the 7820 million outstanding under the term loan facility and accelerated the expensing of 15 million of deferred financing costs 

◦ during the fourth quarter of 2019 we prepaid 5000 million of the 7500 million senior floating rate notes due 2020 and accelerated the expensing of 03 million of deferred financing costs 

◦ during the first quarter of 2020 we repaid the remaining 2500 million outstanding under the senior floating rate notes 

◦ during the first quarter of 2020 we preemptively drew 7500 million on our revolving credit facility to reduce our exposure to potential shortterm liquidity risk in the banking system as a result of the covid19 pandemic all of which was repaid by the end of the third quarter of 2020 

◦ during the fourth quarter of 2020 we repaid the 3000 million 500 senior notes that we assumed upon the acquisition of family dollar 

overview 

we are a leading operator of more than 15600 retail discount stores and we conduct our operations in two reporting segments our dollar tree segment is the leading operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise predominantly at the fixed price of 100 our family dollar segment operates general merchandise retail discount stores providing consumers with a selection of competitivelypriced merchandise in convenient neighborhood stores 

our net sales are derived from the sale of merchandise two major factors tend to affect our net sales trends first is our success at opening new stores second is the performance of stores once they are open sales vary at our existing stores from one year to the next we refer to this as a change in comparable store net sales because we include only those stores that are open throughout both of the periods being compared beginning after the first fifteen months of operation we include sales from stores expanded or remodeled during the year in the calculation of comparable store net sales which has the effect of increasing our comparable store net sales the term ‘expanded’ also includes stores that are relocated stores that have been rebannered are considered to be new stores and are not included in the calculation of the comparable store net sales change until after the first fifteen months of operation under the new brand 

at january 30 2021 we operated stores in 48 states and the district of columbia as well as stores in five canadian provinces a breakdown of store counts and square footage by segment for the years ended january 30 2021 and february 1 2020 is as follows 



stores are included as rebanners when they close or open respectively comparable store net sales for dollar tree may be negatively affected when a family dollar store is rebannered near an existing dollar tree store 

the average size of stores opened in 2020 was approximately 8640 selling square feet or about 10800 gross square feet for the dollar tree segment and 8460 selling square feet or about 10360 gross square feet for the family dollar segment for 2021 we continue to plan to open stores that are 8000  10000 selling square feet or about 10000  12000 gross square feet for the dollar tree segment and 7000  10000 selling square feet or about 9000  12000 gross square feet for the family dollar segment we believe that these size stores are in the ranges of our optimal sizes operationally and give our customers a shopping environment which invites them to shop longer buy more and make return visits 

fiscal 2020 fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 each included 52 weeks 

the percentage change in comparable store net sales on a constant currency basis for the fiscal year ended january 30 2021 as compared with the preceding year is as follows 



constant currency basis refers to the calculation excluding the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations we calculated the constant currency basis change by translating the current year’s comparable store net sales in canada using the prior year’s currency exchange rates we believe that the constant currency basis provides a more accurate measure of comparable store net sales performance comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores which we include in the calculation and are negatively affected when we open new stores rebanner stores or expand stores near existing stores 

dollar tree initiatives 

we believe that our dollar tree initiatives continue to positively affect our comparable store net sales in fiscal 2019 we introduced our crafter’s square initiative in more than 650 stores this offering includes a new expanded assortment of arts and crafts supplies during fiscal 2020 we expanded this program completing the rollout to all of our dollar tree stores the crafter’s square assortment carries markups which are higher than our average markup additionally for more than a year we have tested a multiprice initiative referred to as dollar tree plus beginning in fiscal 2019 we began testing multiprice assortments in more than 100 stores in southwestern markets based on learnings from the test we made modifications to the mix of products offered to include 

primarily discretionary items the displays and signage to drive awareness and excitement to the stores the price points to focus on the 1 3 and 5 price points and increase the number of offerings above the 1 price point we plan to expand this initiative into a total of 500 stores beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 we believe these initiatives have and will continue to enable us to increase sales and earnings 

family dollar initiatives 

we are executing several initiatives in our family dollar stores to increase sales during 2020 we entered into a partnership with instacart to enable our customers to shop online and receive merchandise without having to visit a store in fiscal 2019 we executed a store optimization program for our family dollar stores to improve performance included in that program was a rollout of a new model for both new and renovated family dollar stores internally known as h2 the h2 model has significantly improved merchandise offerings including approximately 20 dollar tree 100 merchandise sections and establishing a minimum number of freezer and cooler doors throughout the store h2 stores have higher customer traffic and provide an average comparable store net sales lift in excess of 10 when compared to nonrenovated stores in the first year following renovation h2 stores perform well in a variety of locations and especially in locations where our family dollar stores have been most challenged in the past as of january 30 2021 we have approximately 2385 h2 stores we plan to renovate at least 1250 stores to this format in fiscal 2021 and also plan to build new stores in this format in addition we installed adult beverage product in approximately 570 stores in fiscal 2020 and plan to add it to approximately 1000 stores in fiscal 2021 we believe the addition of adult beverage to our assortment will drive traffic to our stores 

building on the success of the h2 format we have developed a combination store which leverages both the dollar tree and family dollar brands to serve small towns across the country we are taking family dollar’s great value and assortment and blending in select dollar tree merchandise categories creating a new store format targeted for small towns and rural communities with populations of 3000 to 4000 residents 

other items 

additionally the following items have already impacted or could impact our business or results of operations during 2021 or in the future 

• we are experiencing delays in receiving import merchandise as a result of worldwide container and other equipment shortages and issues with port congestion in the united states the port congestion is resulting in ships not returning to asia in a timely manner as well as impacting equipment availability this is resulting in delays in product being loaded and shipped from overseas locations although this has not yet impacted our sales and we believe we are adequately stocked with merchandise for easter the delays could potentially have a material adverse impact on our sales after easter especially at dollar tree if the delays do not improve in addition to creating business uncertainty this disruption in the import transportation process is also resulting in higher costs we are also seeing increases in the cost to ship domestic freight from our suppliers to our distribution centers we are currently projecting approximately 800 to 1000 million of additional costs in fiscal 2021 as a result of higher shipping and domestic freight costs 

• in 2021 the minimum wage has increased in certain states and localities and may increase nationally depending on the outcome of future legislation proposed in congress the currently scheduled minimum wage increases are estimated to increase store payroll by 450 million to 500 million in 2021 which is less than the covid19related payroll increases in 2020 additional minimum wage increases and other wage and hour law changes in the future could materially impact our results of operations 

• the amount of covid19related costs for premium pay including bonuses supplies protective equipment and similar items was 2790 million in fiscal 2020 the amount of these costs for 2021 is highly uncertain among other things the duration and severity of the pandemic is uncertain and a number of states and localities are considering legislation that could require premium pay for certain essential workers during certain government mandated restricted work periods 

we must continue to control our merchandise costs inventory levels and our general and administrative expenses as increases in these items could negatively impact our operating results 

results of operations 

our results of operations as a percentage of net sales and yearoveryear changes are discussed in the following section 

net sales 



the increase in net sales from 2019 to 2020 was a result of comparable store net sales increases in the family dollar and dollar tree segments and sales of 8524 million at new stores these sales increases were partially offset by lost sales resulting from store closures during fiscal 2019 in connection with our family dollar segment store optimization program 

enterprise comparable store net sales increased 61 on a constant currency basis in 2020 as a result of a 200 increase in average ticket and an 116 decrease in customer traffic comparable store net sales increased 60 when including the impact of canadian currency fluctuations on a constant currency basis comparable store net sales increased 105 in the family dollar segment and 22 in the dollar tree segment lower traffic resulting from the covid19 pandemic negatively affected easter sales in the dollar tree segment in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 

gross profit 



the increase in gross profit margin from 2019 to 2020 was a result of the net of the following 

• occupancy costs decreased 40 basis points as a result of the leverage from the increase in comparable store net sales 

• markdown costs decreased 25 basis points resulting primarily from the prior year including markdowns related to family dollar store closures and clearance sales as well as lower promotional activity in the current year on the family dollar segment as a result of the increase in sales of discretionary product both segments also had higher sellthrough of both christmas and halloween merchandise these decreases were partially offset by 104 million of uninsured markdown costs for stores affected by civil unrest during 2020 and higher seasonal markdowns in the dollar tree segment in the first quarter of 2020 due to the lower than planned sellthrough on easter merchandise as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

• merchandise cost including freight decreased 20 basis points in 2020 compared to 2019 resulting from higher sales of higher margin discretionary merchandise and improved initial markon partially offset by incremental tariff costs of 307 million 

• shrink costs decreased 15 basis points resulting from favorable inventory reconciliations on the family dollar segment in the current year partially offset by unfavorable physical inventory results in relation to accruals on the dollar tree segment 

• distribution costs increased 30 basis points resulting primarily from higher distribution center payroll and depreciation costs we paid our hourly distribution center associates a wage premium for all hours worked from march 8 2020 through january 2 2021 total distribution center covid19related expenses were 363 million or 15 basis points of this increase 

selling general and administrative expenses 



we recorded noncash goodwill impairment charges of 3130 million and 27270 million in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 respectively the goodwill impairments are discussed further in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements excluding the goodwill impairment charges in 2019 and 2018 selling general and administrative expenses were 232 and 226 as a percentage of net sales in 2019 and 2018 respectively the decrease in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales from 2019 to 2020 excluding the goodwill impairment charge from 2019 was the result of the net of the following 

• other selling general and administrative expenses decreased 40 basis points as a result of the leverage from the comparable store net sales increase higher costs in the prior year related to the disposal of fixed assets in connection with the store optimization program on the family dollar segment lower promotional advertising on the family dollar segment decreases in travel due to the covid19 pandemic lower legal expenses and higher costs in the prior year for the store support center consolidation these improvements were partially offset by an increase in store supplies expenses due to the covid19 pandemic fiscal 2020 included 265 million or 10 basis points of costs for the installation of plexiglass sneeze guards at all registers in our stores as well as incremental costs for masks gloves and cleaning supplies due to the covid19 pandemic and 27 million of uninsured costs associated with stores damaged in civil unrest 

• store facility costs decreased 20 basis points due to leverage from the comparable store net sales increase and lower electricity costs fiscal 2020 included 13 million of covid19related expenses and 45 million of expenses for stores damaged in civil unrest 

• depreciation costs decreased 5 basis points due primarily to the leverage from the comparable store net sales increase 

• payroll expenses increased 65 basis points primarily due to incremental costs associated with the covid19 pandemic and increases in incentive compensation store sales bonuses and stock compensation expenses resulting from improved operating performance in the family dollar segment these increases were partially offset by leverage from the comparable store net sales increase lower benefits costs and lower temporary help expenses as a result of the prior year including higher expenses to support storelevel initiatives office payroll costs also decreased resulting from the store support center consolidation in the prior year and other leadership changes made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 incremental payroll costs associated with the covid19 pandemic including a wage premium paid to all store hourly associates for all hours worked march 8 2020 through september 26 2020 bonuses for certain field management associates guaranteed bonus payouts and “thank you” bonuses for store managers quarantine pay and sick pay as well as the related payroll taxes totaled 2126 million or 85 basis points 

operating income loss 



excluding the noncash goodwill impairment charges in 2019 and 2018 operating income margin was 67 in 2019 and 78 in 2018 operating income margin increased to 74 in fiscal 2020 compared to 67 in fiscal 2019 excluding the goodwill impairment charge as operating income margin in the family dollar segment increased 330 basis points partially offset by a 140 basis point decrease in the dollar tree segment operating income margin operating income in fiscal 2020 includes 2790 million of covid19related expenses and 182 million of uninsured expenses related to civil unrest 

interest expense net 



interest expense net decreased 148 million in fiscal 2020 compared to the prior year resulting from lower average debt outstanding in the current year partially offset by lower interest income 

in fiscal 2018 we refinanced our debt resulting in the acceleration of the expensing of 412 million of amortizable noncash deferred financing costs and prepayment penalties totaling 1143 million 

provision for income taxes 



the effective tax rate for 2020 was 229 compared to 247 for 2019 the 2020 effective rate decreased compared to the prior year rate as the 3130 million goodwill impairment charge in 2019 was not tax deductible partially offsetting that decrease the 2020 rate reflects higher state tax rates higher income amounts taxed at the statutory rate and additional tax expense for restricted stock vestings due to the stock price for certain grants being lower at the vest date than the grant date the 2019 effective tax rate also includes the benefit of the reversal of a valuation allowance of 246 million 

segment information 

we operate a chain of more than 15600 retail discount stores in 48 states and five canadian provinces our operations are conducted in two reporting business segments dollar tree and family dollar we define our segments as those operations whose results our chief operating decision maker “codm” regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources 

we measure the results of our segments using among other measures each segment’s net sales gross profit and operating income the codm reviews these metrics for each of our reporting segments we may revise the measurement of each segment’s operating income as determined by the information regularly reviewed by the codm if the measurement of a segment changes prior period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period’s presentation corporate support and other consists primarily of store support center costs that are considered shared services and therefore these selling general and administrative costs are excluded from our two reporting business segments these costs include operating expenses for our store support centers in chesapeake virginia and matthews north carolina during fiscal 2019 we consolidated our matthews north carolina store support center with our store support center in chesapeake virginia corporate support and other also includes the results of operations for our summit pointe property in chesapeake virginia prior year amounts have been reclassified to be comparable to the current year presentation

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates certain of our estimates require a high level of judgment and have the potential to have a material effect on the financial statements if actual results vary significantly from those estimates following is a discussion of the policies that we consider critical 

inventory valuation 

as discussed in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements under the caption “merchandise inventories” inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost determined on a weightedaverage basis cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weightedaverage basis under the retail inventory method the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated costtoretail ratio to the retail value of inventories the retail inventory method is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis 

inventory valuation methods require certain management estimates and judgments including estimates of future merchandise markdowns and shrink which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins the averaging required in applying the retail inventory method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns could under certain circumstances result in costs not being recorded in the proper period 

we estimate our markdown reserve based on the consideration of a variety of factors including but not limited to quantities of slow moving or seasonal carryover merchandise on hand historical markdown statistics and future merchandising plans the accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors some of which are outside of our control including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends historically we have not experienced significant differences in our estimated reserve for markdowns compared with actual results 

our accrual for shrink is based on the actual historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories adjusted if necessary for current economic conditions and business trends these estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger our physical inventory counts are generally taken between january and october of each year therefore the shrink accrual recorded at january 30 2021 is based on estimated shrink for most of 2020 including the fourth quarter the amounts recorded in the current year reflect the dollar tree and family dollar segments’ historical results we periodically adjust our shrink estimates to reflect our best estimates based on the factors described 

our management believes that our application of the retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market each year on a consistent basis 

selfinsurance liabilities 

the liabilities related to our selfinsurance programs for workers’ compensation and general liability are estimates that require judgment and the use of assumptions semiannually we obtain thirdparty actuarial valuations to aid in valuing the liabilities and in determining the amount to accrue during the year these actuarial valuations are estimates based on our historical loss development factors and the related accruals are adjusted as management’s estimates change 

management’s estimate for selfinsurance liabilities could vary from the ultimate loss sustained given the difficulty in predicting future events however historically the net total of these differences has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair values these assets are not amortized but are evaluated annually for impairment a more frequent evaluation is performed if events or circumstances indicate that impairment could have occurred such events or circumstances could include but are not limited to significant negative industry or economic trends unanticipated changes in the competitive environment and a significant sustained decline in the market price of our stock 

for purposes of our goodwill impairment evaluation the reporting units are family dollar dollar tree and dollar tree canada goodwill has been assigned to the reporting units based on prior business combinations related to the brands in the event a qualitative assessment of the fair value of a reporting unit indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount we then estimate the fair value using a combination of a market multiple method and a discounted cash flow method under the market multiple approach we estimate a fair value based on comparable companies’ market multiples of revenues and earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” and adjusted for a control premium under the discounted cash flow approach we project future cash flows which are discounted using a weightedaverage cost of capital analysis that reflects current market conditions adjusted for specific reporting unit risks primarily the uncertainty of achieving projected operating cash flows if 

the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

the family dollar goodwill and trade name comprise a substantial portion of our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and management’s judgment utilized in the family dollar goodwill and trade name impairment evaluations is critical the computations require management to make estimates and assumptions and actual results may differ significantly particularly if there are significant adverse changes in the operating environment critical assumptions that are used as part of the family dollar goodwill evaluation include 

• the potential future revenue ebitda and cash flows of the reporting unit the projections use management’s assumptions about economic and market conditions over the projected period as well as our estimates of future performance and reporting unit revenue gross margin expenses and other factors the resulting revenue ebitda and cash flow estimates are based on our most recent business operating plans and various growth rates have been assumed for years beyond the current business plan period we believe that the assumptions estimates and rates used in our fiscal 2020 impairment evaluations are reasonable however variations in the assumptions estimates and rates could result in significantly different estimates of fair value 

• selection of an appropriate discount rate calculating the present value of future cash flows requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate which is based on a weightedaverage cost of capital analysis the discount rate is affected by changes in shortterm interest rates and longterm yield as well as variances in the typical capital structure of marketplace participants given current economic conditions it is possible that the discount rate will fluctuate in the near term we engaged third party experts to assist in the determination of the weightedaverage cost of capital used to discount the cash flows for our family dollar reporting unit the weightedaverage cost of capital used to discount the cash flows for our evaluation was 825 for our fiscal 2020 analysis 

indefinitelived intangible assets such as the family dollar trade name are not subject to amortization but are reviewed at least annually for impairment the indefinitelived intangible asset impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible assets to their carrying values we estimate the fair value of our trade name intangible asset based on an income approach using the relieffromroyalty method this approach is dependent upon a number of factors including estimates of future growth and trends royalty rates discount rates and other variables we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain the discount rate includes a premium compared to the discount used for the family dollar goodwill impairment evaluation due to the inherently higher risk profile of intangible assets compared to the overall reporting unit 

our evaluation of goodwill did not result in an impairment charge being recorded in fiscal 2020 noncash impairment charges of 3130 million and 273 billion were recorded in fiscal 2019 and 2018 respectively related to the family dollar reporting unit our evaluation of the family dollar trade name did not result in impairment charges during fiscal 2020 2019 or 2018 based on the results of the 2020 evaluation the fair value of the family dollar reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by a significant margin and the fair value of the family dollar trade name exceeded its carrying value by approximately 75 

for additional information related to goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets including the related impairment evaluations refer to note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to uncertainties associated with the key assumptions and any potential events andor circumstances that could have a negative effect on the key assumptions please refer to “ item 1a risk factors ” and elsewhere within this “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” if our assumptions and related estimates change in the future we may be required to record impairment charges against earnings in future periods any impairment charges that we may take in the future could be material to our results of operations and financial condition 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of our business including the impact of interest rate changes and diesel fuel cost changes we may enter into interest rate or diesel fuel swaps to manage exposure to interest rate and diesel fuel price changes we do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging and we do not hold derivative instruments for trading purposes 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to interest rate risk relates to our revolving credit facility as borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at libor reset periodically plus 100 to 150 as determined by our credit ratings and leverage ratio at january 30 2021 there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility

we operate in two reporting business segments dollar tree and family dollar for discussion of the operating results of our reporting business segments refer to “ item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” under the caption “segment information” and note 12 to our consolidated financial statements

we strive to exceed our customers’ expectations of the variety and quality of products they can purchase for 100 by offering items we believe typically sell for higher prices elsewhere we buy approximately 58 to 60 of our merchandise domestically and import the remaining 40 to 42  our domestic purchases include basic seasonal home closeouts and promotional merchandise we believe our mix of imported and domestic merchandise affords our buyers flexibility that allows them to consistently exceed our customers’ expectations in addition direct relationships with manufacturers permit us to select from a broad range of products and customize packaging product sizes and package quantities that meet our customers’ needs 

the addition of frozen and refrigerated merchandise to more of our dollar tree stores has been one of our ongoing initiatives we added freezers and coolers to approximately 490 additional stores in fiscal 2019 as of february 1 2020  we have freezers and coolers in approximately 6155 of our dollar tree stores we plan to install them in 425 new and existing stores during fiscal 2020 in fiscal 2018 we rolled out a new layout to a number of our dollar tree stores which we call our snack zone this layout highlights our immediate consumption snack offerings in the front of the store near the checkout areas as of february 1 2020  we have snack zone in more than 2100 dollar tree stores and we plan to incorporate snack zone in 500 new and existing stores in fiscal 2020 we believe these initiatives have and will continue to enable us to improve sales and earnings by increasing the number of shopping trips made by our customers 

we carry approximately 7700 items in our dollar tree stores and as of the end of fiscal 2019 approximately 37 of our items are automatically replenished the remaining items are pushed to the stores and a portion can be reordered by our store managers on a weekly basis through automatic replenishment and our store managers’ ability to order product each store manager is able to satisfy the demands of their particular customer base 

we maintain a balanced selection of products within traditional variety store categories we offer a wide selection of everyday basic products and we supplement these basic everyday items with seasonal closeout and promotional merchandise we attempt to keep certain basic consumable merchandise in our stores continuously to establish our stores as a destination and increase traffic in our stores closeout and promotional merchandise is purchased opportunistically and represents less than 10 of our purchases

our family dollar stores provide customers with a quality highvalue assortment of basic necessities and seasonal merchandise we offer competitivelypriced national brands from leading manufacturers alongside name brand equivalentvalue lowerpriced private labels we purchase merchandise from a wide variety of suppliers and generally have not experienced difficulty in obtaining adequate quantities of merchandise in fiscal 2019 we purchased approximately 14 of our merchandise through our relationship with mclane company inc which distributes consumable merchandise from multiple manufacturers in addition approximately 17 of our merchandise is imported directly 

we are executing several initiatives in our family dollar stores to increase sales after continued development experimentation and testing in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 we introduced a new model for both new and renovated family dollar stores known as h2 the h2 store format has significantly improved merchandise offerings including approximately 20 dollar tree 100 merchandise sections and establishing a minimum number of freezer and cooler doors throughout the store the stores with the h2 format have increased traffic and provided an average comparable store net sales lift in excess of 10 in the first year following renovation the h2 format performs well in a variety of locations and especially in locations where family dollar has been most challenged in the past we started fiscal 2019 with approximately 200 h2 stores and ended fiscal 2019 with approximately 1535 h2 stores we plan to renovate at least 1250 stores to this format in fiscal 2020 and also plan to build new stores in this format

business strategy 

continue to execute our proven and best‑in‑class retail business strategy we will continue to execute our proven strategies that have generated a history of success and continued growth for the company key elements of our strategy include 

• aiming continuously to “wow” the customer with a compelling fun and fresh merchandise assortment comprising a 

variety of the things you want and things you need all at incredible values in bright clean and friendly stores 

• maintaining a flexible sourcing merchandise model that allows a variety of products to be sold as long as desired 

merchandise margin thresholds are met 

 • pursuing a “more better faster” approach to the rollout of new dollar tree and family dollar stores to broaden our 

geographic footprint 

 • maintaining a prudent approach with our use of capital for the benefit of our shareholders 

operate a diversified and complementary business model across both fixed ‑ price and multi ‑ price point strategies we plan to operate and grow both the dollar tree and family dollar brands we will utilize the reach and scale of our combined company to serve a broader range of customers in more ways offering better prices and more value for the customer at dollar tree everything is 100 offering the customer a balanced mix of things they need and things they want our shopping experience will remain fun and friendly as we exceed our customers’ expectations for what they can buy for 100 we are currently testing a concept known as dollar tree plus in a small group of stores merchandise in these stores includes select items which retail for more than 100 but not more than 500 and maintain our customers’ expectations of extreme value dollar tree serves a broad range of income customers in suburban locations family dollar stores will continue to operate using multiple price points serving customers as their “neighborhood discount store” offering great values on everyday items and a convenient shopping experience family dollar primarily serves a lower than average income customer in urban and rural locations we will benefit from an expanded target customer profile and utilize the store concepts of both dollar tree and family dollar to serve a broader range of customer demographics to drive further improvements in sales and profitability 

take advantage of significant whitespace opportunity over the past decade we have built a solid and scalable infrastructure which provides a strong foundation for our future growth we are committed to growing our combined business to take advantage of significant white space opportunities that we believe exist for both the dollar tree and family dollar store concepts using our proven real estate strategy across our combined business we intend to drive future store openings by capitalizing on data‑driven insights regarding location target customer profile competitive dynamics and cost structure over the longterm we believe that the market can support more than 10000 dollar tree stores and 15000 family dollar stores across the united states and approximately 1000 dollar tree stores in canada 

convenient locations and store size we focus primarily on opening new dollar tree stores in strip shopping centers anchored by large retailers who draw target customers we believe to be similar to ours our stores are successful in metropolitan areas midsized cities and small towns we open new family dollar stores in strip shopping centers freestanding buildings and downtown buildings the range of our new store sizes 8000  10000 selling square feet for dollar tree and 7000  9000 selling square feet for family dollar allows us to target a particular location with a store that best suits that market and takes advantage of available real estate opportunities our stores are attractively designed and create an inviting atmosphere for shoppers by using bright lighting vibrant colors and decorative signs we enhance the store design with attractive merchandise displays we believe this design attracts new and repeat customers and enhances our image as both a destination and impulse purchase store 

profitable stores with strong cash flow we maintain a disciplined costsensitive approach to store site selection in order to minimize the initial capital investment required and maximize our potential to generate high operating margins and strong cash flows we believe that our stores have a relatively small shopping radius which allows us to profitably concentrate multiple stores within a single market our ability to open new stores is dependent upon among other factors locating suitable sites and negotiating favorable lease terms 

the strong cash flows generated by our stores allow us to selffund infrastructure investment and new stores over the past five years cash flows from operating activities have exceeded capital expenditures 

for more information on our results of operations see “ item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” 

cost control  we believe that our substantial buying power and our flexibility in making sourcing decisions contributes to our successful purchasing strategy which includes targeted merchandise margin goals by category we also believe our ability to negotiate with our vendor partners allows us to minimize the margin impact of economic pressures such as tariffs we buy products on an orderbyorder basis and have no material longterm purchase contracts or other assurances of continued product supply or guaranteed product cost no vendor accounted for more than 10 of total merchandise purchased by us in any of the past five years 

our supply chain systems continue to provide us with valuable sales information to assist our buyers and improve merchandise allocation to our stores we use this information to target our inventory levels in our distribution centers and stores in order to plan for capacity and labor needs 

information systems we believe that investments in technology help us to increase sales and control costs our inventory management system provides information to calculate our estimate of inventory cost under the retail inventory method which is widely used in the retail industry our automated replenishment system replenishes key items based on actual storelevel sales and inventory 

pointofsale data allows us to track sales and inventory by merchandise category at the store level and assists us in planning for future purchases of inventory we believe that this information allows us to ship the appropriate product to stores at the quantities commensurate with selling patterns using this pointofsale data to plan purchases has helped us manage our inventory levels 

corporate culture and values we believe that honesty and integrity and treating people fairly and with respect are core values within our corporate culture we believe that running a business and certainly a public company carries with it a responsibility to be above reproach when making operational and financial decisions our executive management team visits and shops at our stores like every customer and ideas and individual creativity on the part of our associates are encouraged particularly from our store managers who know their stores and their customers we have standards for store displays merchandise presentation and store operations we maintain an open door policy for all associates our distribution centers are operated based on objective measures of performance and virtually everyone in our store support centers is available to assist associates in our stores and distribution centers 

our disclosure committee meets at least quarterly and monitors our internal controls over financial reporting to ensure that our public filings contain discussions about the potential risks our business faces we believe that we have appropriate controls in place to be able to certify our financial statements additionally we have complied with the listing requirements for the nasdaq global select market 

seasonality for information on the impact of seasonality see “ item 1a risk factors ” and “ item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” 

growth strategy 

store openings and square footage growth the primary factors contributing to our net sales growth have been new store openings an active store expansion and remodel program and selective mergers and acquisitions in the last five years net sales increased at a compound annual growth rate of 111  during this time our store count and approximate selling square footage increased from 13851 and 1084 million square feet at january 30 2016 to 15288 and 1213 million square feet at february 1 2020 we expect that the majority of our future sales growth will come from new store openings in our dollar tree and family dollar segments and our store expansion and relocation program as well as our renovation initiatives 

our growth and productivity statistics are reported based on selling square footage because our management believes the use of selling square footage yields a more accurate measure of store productivity we expect to increase the selling square footage in our stores in the future by opening new stores in underserved markets and strategically increasing our presence in our existing markets via new store openings and store expansions expansions include store relocations in fiscal 2020 and beyond we plan to predominantly open dollar tree stores that are approximately 8000  10000 selling square feet and family dollar stores that are approximately 7000  9000 selling square feet we believe these store sizes allow us to achieve our objectives in the markets in which we plan to expand 

in addition to new store openings we plan to continue our dollar tree store expansion program to increase our net sales per store and take advantage of market opportunities we target stores for expansion based on the current sales per selling square foot and changes in market opportunities stores targeted for expansion are generally less than 7000 selling square feet in size store expansions generally increase the existing store size by approximately 2500 selling square feet at february 1 2020  6276 of our dollar tree stores totaling approximately 88 of our dollar tree segment selling square footage were 7000 selling square feet or larger 

since 1995 we have added a total of 695 stores through several mergers and acquisitions excluding our acquisition of family dollar historically our acquisition strategy has been to target companies that have a similar single price point concept that have shown success in operations or companies that provide a strategic advantage we evaluate potential acquisition opportunities as they become available on july 6 2015 we completed our acquisition of family dollar which allowed us to create a diversified company with complementary business models 

from time to time we also acquire the rights to store leases through bankruptcy or other proceedings we will continue to take advantage of these opportunities as they arise depending upon several factors including their fit within our location and selling square footage size parameters 

merchandising and distribution expanding our customer base is important to our growth plans we plan to continue to stock our stores with a compelling mix of everchanging merchandise that our customers have come to appreciate consumable merchandise typically leads to more frequent return trips to our stores resulting in increased sales the presentation and display of merchandise in our stores are critical to communicating value to our customers and creating a more exciting shopping experience we believe our approach to visual merchandising results in higher sales volume and an environment that encourages impulse purchases 

a strong and efficient distribution network is critical to our ability to grow and to maintain a lowcost operating structure in fiscal 2019 we began construction of a new 12 million square foot distribution center in rosenberg texas which is expected to be operational by the summer of 2020 additionally in fiscal 2019 we completed construction of our morrow county ohio distribution center which is 12 million square feet and automated and currently serves stores in our dollar tree segment in fiscal 2019 we announced plans to construct a new high velocity distribution center in ocala florida that will provide service directly to dollar tree and family dollar stores throughout florida and parts of the southeast and will be built in two phases eventually comprising a 17 million square foot facility 

our st george utah distribution center services both family dollar and dollar tree stores in addition to support the h2 initiative we ship select product from our dollar tree distribution centers to our family dollar distribution centers and in fiscal 2019 we began to ship select product from our dollar tree distribution centers directly to certain of our family dollar stores we believe our distribution center network is currently capable of supporting approximately 295 billion in annual sales in the united states new distribution sites are strategically located to reduce stem miles maintain flexibility and improve efficiency in our store service areas we also are a party to an agreement which provides distribution services from two facilities in canada 

our dollar tree stores receive approximately 90 of their inventory from our distribution centers via contract carriers and our family dollar stores receive approximately 73 of their inventory from our distribution centers the remaining store inventory primarily perishable consumable items and other vendormaintained display items are delivered directly to our stores from vendors our family dollar stores receive approximately 14 of their merchandise from mclane company inc for more information on our distribution center network see “ item 2 properties ” 

competition 

our segment of the retail industry is fragmented and highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future we operate in the discount retail sector which is currently and is expected to continue to be highly competitive with respect to price store location merchandise quality assortment and presentation and customer service our competitors include singleprice dollar stores multiprice dollar stores mass merchandisers online retailers discount retailers drug stores convenience stores independentlyoperated discount stores and a wide variety of other retailers in addition several competitors have sections within their stores devoted to “one dollar” price point merchandise which further increases competition we believe we differentiate ourselves from other retailers by providing highvalue highquality lowcost merchandise in attractivelydesigned stores that are conveniently located our sales and profits could be reduced by increases in competition there are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector 

trademarks 

we are the owners of several federal service mark registrations including “dollar tree” the “dollar tree” logo and the dollar tree logo with a “1” in addition we own a registration for “dollar bill” we also acquired the rights to use trade names previously owned by everything’s a dollar a former competitor in the 100 price point industry several trade names were included in the purchase including the mark “everything’s 100” we also own the logo mark for “everything’s 1” with the acquisition of dollar giant we became the owner of several trademarks in canada with the acquisition of family dollar we became the owners of the trademarks “family dollar” “family dollar stores” and other names and designs of certain merchandise sold in family dollar stores we have federal trademark registrations for a number and variety of private labels that we use to market many of our product lines our trademark registrations have various expiration dates however assuming that the trademark registrations are properly maintained and renewed they have a perpetual duration 

employees 

we employed approximately 56900 fulltime and 136200 parttime associates on february 1 2020  parttime associates work an average of less than 30 hours per week the number of parttime associates fluctuates depending on seasonal needs we consider our relationship with our associates to be good and we have not experienced significant interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements 




 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk any failure to meet market expectations including our comparable store sales growth rate earnings and earnings per share or new store openings could cause the market price of our stock to decline you should carefully consider the specific risk factors listed below together with all other information included or incorporated in this report and other filings that we make from time to time with the sec including our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes any of the following risks may materialize and additional risks not known to us or that we now deem immaterial may arise in such event our business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected 

our profitability is vulnerable to cost increases 

future increases in costs such as wage and benefit costs the cost of merchandise duties merchandise loss due to theft damage or errors shipping rates freight costs fuel costs and store occupancy costs would reduce our profitability wage rates and labor costs are expected to increase in 2020 the minimum wage has increased in certain states and local jurisdictions and is scheduled to increase further in 2020 

in our dollar tree segment we do not raise the sales price of our merchandise to offset cost increases because we are committed to selling primarily at the 100 price point to continue to provide value to the customer we are dependent on our ability to adjust our product assortment to operate more efficiently or to increase our comparable store net sales in order to offset cost increases we can give no assurance that we will be able to operate more efficiently or increase our comparable store net sales in the future although family dollar unlike dollar tree can raise the price of merchandise customers would buy fewer products if prices were to increase please see “ item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” for further discussion of the effect of economic factors on our operations 

the coronavirus pandemic is an emerging serious threat to health and economic wellbeing affecting our customers our associates and our sources of supply 

on march 11 2020 the world health organization announced that infections of the coronavirus covid19 had become pandemic and on march 13 the us president announced a national emergency relating to the disease there is a possibility of widespread infection in the united states and abroad with the potential for catastrophic impact national state and local authorities have recommended social distancing and imposed or are considering quarantine and isolation measures on large portions of the population including mandatory business closures these measures while intended to protect human life are expected to have serious adverse impacts on domestic and foreign economies of uncertain severity and duration the effectiveness of economic stabilization efforts including proposed government payments to affected citizens and industries is uncertain some economists are predicting the united states will soon enter a recession 

the sweeping nature of the covid19 pandemic makes it extremely difficult to predict how the company’s business and operations will be affected in the longer run however the likely overall economic impact of the pandemic is viewed as highly negative to the general economy we may become subject to store closures we have been classified as an essential business in the jurisdictions that have decided that issue to date and we have been allowed to remain open our small convenient stores our sale of food paper products personal sanitation products cleaning supplies and over the counter drugs and our acceptance of snap benefits among other factors have been important to our classification as an essential business however we can give no assurance that that will not change in the future we may also be forced to close for other reasons such as the health of our associates or because of disruptions in the continued operation of our supply chain and sources of supply it is possible facility closures for health reasons could also impact company distribution centers or our storesupport center in chesapeake virginia additionally as pandemic conditions wane we cannot predict how quickly the marketplaces in which we operate would return to normal 

any of the foregoing factors or other cascading effects of the coronavirus pandemic that are not currently foreseeable could materially increase our costs negatively impact our sales and damage the company’s results of operations and its liquidity position possibly to a significant degree the duration of any such impacts cannot be predicted 

we could continue to encounter higher costs and disruptions in our distribution network 

our success is dependent on our ability to transport merchandise to our distribution centers and then to our stores in a timely and costeffective manner we also rely heavily on third parties including ocean shippers and truckers in that process we may not anticipate respond to or control all of the challenges of operating our distribution network additionally when a shipping or trucking line fails to deliver on its commitments or our distribution centers fail to operate effectively we could experience merchandise shortages that could lead to lost sales or increased costs in the last several years we have incurred higher distribution costs due to a variety of factors some of the factors that could have an adverse effect on our distribution network or costs in 2020 are 

 risks associated with our domestic and foreign suppliers including tariffs or restrictions on trade or disruptions arising from the outbreak of the recent coronavirus could adversely affect our financial performance 

we are dependent on our vendors to supply merchandise in a timely and efficient manner if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments due to financial or other difficulties we could experience merchandise shortages which could lead to lost sales or increased merchandise costs if alternative sources must be used 

we rely on the availability of imported goods at favorable wholesale prices merchandise imported directly accounts for approximately 40 to 42 of our dollar tree segment’s total retail value purchases and 16 to 18 of our family dollar segment’s total retail value purchases in addition we believe that a significant portion of our goods purchased from domestic vendors is imported china is the source of a substantial majority of our imports imported goods are generally less expensive than domestic goods and increase our profit margins a disruption in the flow of our imported merchandise or an increase in the cost of those goods may significantly decrease our profits risks associated with our reliance on imported goods may include disruptions in the flow of or increases in the cost of imported goods because of factors such as 



 see “ item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” for further discussion of the effect of foreign suppliers on our operations 

the continuing integration of family dollar’s operations is not complete and may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected 

in fiscal 2019 we consolidated company and segment oversight in a single corporate headquarters with one president chief merchant and chief operating officer managing both our family dollar and dollar tree stores significant progress has been made in the integration of family dollar and dollar tree but the process is not yet complete in 2019 we replaced a significant number of family dollar associates in core functions such as merchandising due to the consolidation of the family dollar store support center to virginia it will take our new personnel some time to gain the experience of their predecessors it is possible that the remaining integration process will take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of key employees higher than expected costs or unexpected costs ongoing diversion of management attention increased competition the disruption of our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers vendors and employees if we experience these difficulties the anticipated benefits of the integration may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected which could adversely affect our results of operations or business 

our business could be adversely affected if we fail to attract and retain qualified associates and key personnel 

our growth and performance is dependent on the skills experience and contributions of our associates executives and key personnel for both dollar tree and family dollar various factors including the integration of our segments constraints on overall labor availability wage rates regulatory or legislative impacts and benefit costs could impact our ability to attract and retain qualified associates at our stores distribution centers and corporate offices 

our growth is dependent on our ability to increase sales in existing stores and to expand our square footage profitably 

existing store sales growth is critical to good operating results and is dependent on a variety of factors including merchandise quality relevance and availability store operations and customer satisfaction in addition increased competition could adversely affect our sales failure to meet our sales targets including in our renovated stores could result in our needing to record material noncash impairment charges related to our intangible assets we believe improving sales at family dollar depends in significant part on the success of the h2 renovations which accelerated in 2019 sales growth in the more than 1300 h2 stores opened or renovated in 2019 performed well above the family dollar store average but it is uncertain how those stores will perform in 2020 in their second year of operation 

our highest sales periods are during the christmas and easter seasons and we generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and our operating and net income during the fourth quarter in anticipation we stock extra inventory and hire many temporary employees to prepare our stores a reduction in sales during these periods could adversely affect our operating results particularly operating and net income to a greater extent than if a reduction occurred at other times of the year untimely merchandise delays due to receiving or distribution problems could have a similar effect 

our plans for 2020 project that our profitability improvements as compared to 2019 will be primarily realized in the last three quarters of the year as a result performance and disruption problems in those quarters may have a bigger impact on our achieving our profitability targets for 2020 

when easter is observed earlier in the year the selling season is shorter and as a result our sales could be adversely affected easter was observed on april 21 2019 and will be observed on april 12 2020 

expanding our square footage profitably depends on a number of uncertainties including our ability to locate lease build out and open or expand stores in suitable locations on a timely basis under favorable economic terms obtaining an increasing number of profitable stores is an ever increasing challenge in addition our expansion is dependent upon thirdparty developers’ abilities to acquire land obtain financing and secure necessary permits and approvals we also open or expand stores within our established geographic markets where new or expanded stores may draw sales away from our existing stores we may not manage 

our expansion effectively and our failure to achieve our expansion plans could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our profitability is affected by the mix of products we sell 

our gross profit margin decreases when we increase the proportion of higher cost goods we sell imported merchandise is generally lower cost than domestic goods our supply of goods including imported goods could be negatively impacted by the coronavirus covid19 in recent years the percentage of our sales from higher cost consumable products has increased and we can give no assurance that this trend will not continue 

in addition shrink has increased especially at family dollar as a result our gross profit margin has decreased we are instituting processes and procedures to decrease shrink but we can give no assurance that they will be successful 

in our family dollar segment our success also depends on our ability to select and obtain sufficient quantities of relevant merchandise at prices that allow us to sell such merchandise at profitable and appropriate prices a sales price that is too high causes products to be less attractive to our customers and our sales at family dollar could suffer we are continuing to implement our everyday low price strategy at family dollar to drive customer loyalty and have a strategic pricing team to improve our value and to increase profitability inability to successfully implement our pricing strategies at family dollar could have a negative effect on our business 

in addition our family dollar segment has a substantial number of private brand items and the number of items has been increasing we believe our success in maintaining broad market acceptance of our private brands depends on many factors including our pricing costs quality and customer perception we may not achieve or maintain our expected sales for our private brands and as a result our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted additionally the increased number of private brands could negatively impact our existing relationships with our nonprivate brand suppliers 

we may stop selling or recall certain products for safetyrelated issues 

we may stop selling or recall certain products produced by certain manufacturers for safetyrelated issues including product contamination product content such as lead spoilage or other adulteration improper manufacturing processes improper testing product mislabeling or product tampering for example we may stop selling or recall products if the products or operations of our suppliers violate applicable laws or regulations including food drug and cosmetic safety laws or when our suppliers’ products cause injury illness or death in addition our marketing of adulterated products could subject us to claims of false or deceptive advertising or other criticism a significant product liability or other legal judgment against us a related regulatory enforcement action or a widespread product recall could materially and adversely affect our reputation and results of operations moreover even if a product liability consumer fraud or other claim is unsuccessful has no merit or is not pursued the negative publicity surrounding assertions against the products we sell could materially and adversely affect our business reputation and profitability 

we rely on computer and technology systems in our operations and any material failure inadequacy interruption or security failure of those systems including because of a cyberattack could harm our ability to effectively operate and grow our business and could adversely affect our financial results 

we rely extensively on our computer and technology systems and in certain cases those of thirdparty service providers to manage inventory process credit card and customer transactions and summarize results our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the distribution and sale of our merchandise depends significantly on the reliability integrity and capacity of these systems and on our ability to successfully integrate the dollar tree and family dollar systems we also rely on thirdparty providers and platforms for some of these computer and technology systems and support 

although we have operational safeguards in place they may not be effective in preventing the failure of these systems or platforms to operate effectively and be available to us this may be as the result of deliberate breach in the security of these systems or platforms by bad actors including through computer viruses ransomware and other cyberattacks failures may also be caused by various other factors including power outages catastrophic events physical theft computer and network failures inadequate or ineffective redundancy problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or platforms flaws in thirdparty software or services errors or improper use by our employees or third party service providers 

if these systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process customer transactions and may receive negative publicity which could adversely affect our results of operations and business in addition remediation of any problems with our systems could result in significant unplanned expenses 

if we suffer a data breach and are unable to secure our customers’ credit card and confidential information or other private data relating to our associates suppliers or our business we could be subject to negative publicity costly government enforcement actions or private litigation and increased costs which could damage our business reputation and adversely affect our results of operations or business 

many of our information technology systems such as those we use for our pointofsale web and mobile platforms including online and mobile payment systems and for administrative functions including human resources payroll accounting and internal and external communications contain personal financial or other information that is entrusted to us by our customers and associates many of our information technology systems also contain proprietary and other confidential information related to our business and suppliers 

we have procedures and technology in place to safeguard our customers’ debit and credit card information our associates’ private data suppliers’ data and our business records and intellectual property and other sensitive information despite these measures we have experienced attempted and ongoing cyberattacks which are rapidly evolving perpetrators who may include wellfunded state actors are becoming increasingly sophisticated and difficult to detect we may be vulnerable to and unable to anticipate detect and appropriately respond to such cybersecurity attacks including data security breaches and data loss if we or any thirdparty systems we use experience a data security breach we could be exposed to negative publicity government enforcement actions and private litigation in addition our reputation within the business community and with our customers may be affected which could result in our customers discontinuing the use of debit or credit cards in our stores or not shopping in our stores altogether 

moreover significant capital investments and other expenditures could also be required to remedy cybersecurity problems and prevent future security breaches including costs associated with additional security technologies personnel experts and services eg creditmonitoring services for those whose data has been breached these costs which could be material could adversely impact our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred and may not meaningfully limit the success of future attempts to breach our information technology systems 

the unavailability of our information technology systems or the failure of those systems or software to perform as anticipated for any reason and any inability to respond to or recover from such an event could disrupt our business decrease performance and increase overhead costs if we are unable to secure our customers’ credit card and confidential information or other private data relating to our associates suppliers or our business we could be subject to negative publicity costly government enforcement actions or private litigation and increased costs any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or business 

we could incur losses due to impairment of longlived assets goodwill and intangible assets 

under us generally accepted accounting principles we review our longlived assets for impairment whenever economic events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable identifiable intangible assets with an indefinite useful life including goodwill are not amortized but are evaluated annually for impairment a more frequent evaluation is performed if events or circumstances indicate that impairment could have occurred 

in fiscal 2019 and 2018 we recorded a 3130 million and a 273 billion noncash pretax and aftertax goodwill impairment charge respectively related to our family dollar reporting unit in 2018 as a result of a strategic and operational reassessment of the family dollar segment following challenges that the business experienced which impacted our ability to grow the business at the originally estimated rate when the company made the acquisition in 2015 we determined that the carrying value of the family dollar assets was greater than its estimated fair value and recorded an impairment charge these challenges included slower sales growth increased freight costs driven by the driver shortage reinvestment in store labor and higher shrink failure to fully address these challenges significant negative industry or general economic trends other disruptions to our business and unanticipated significant changes in our use of the assets may result in additional impairments to our goodwill intangible assets and other longlived assets following our annual impairment assessment we recorded an impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2019 we will continue to monitor key assumptions and other factors utilized in our goodwill impairment analysis and if business or other market conditions develop that are materially different than we currently anticipate we will conduct an additional impairment evaluation any reduction in or impairment of the value of goodwill or intangible assets will result in a charge against earnings which could have a material adverse impact on our reported results of operations and financial condition for additional information on goodwill impairments please refer to note 3 to our consolidated financial statements 

our business or the value of our common stock could be negatively affected as a result of actions by activist shareholders 

we value constructive input from investors and regularly engage in dialogue with our shareholders regarding strategy and performance the board of directors and management team are committed to acting in the best interests of all of our shareholders there is no assurance that the actions taken by the board of directors and management in seeking to maintain constructive 

engagement with the company’s shareholders will be successful activist shareholders who disagree with the company’s strategy or the way the company is managed have sought to effect change and may seek to effect change in the future through various strategies that range from private engagement to publicity campaigns proxy contests efforts to force transactions not supported by the board of directors and litigation 

responding to these actions may be costly and timeconsuming disrupt our operations divert the attention of our board of directors management and employees and interfere with the company’s ability to execute its strategic plan and attract and retain qualified executive leadership a contested election for example could also require us to incur substantial legal and public relations fees and proxy solicitation expenses the perceived uncertainty as to the company’s future direction resulting from activist strategies could also affect the market price and volatility of the company’s common stock 

litigation and arbitration may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to the risk of litigation and arbitration involving employees consumers suppliers competitors shareholders government agencies or others through private actions class actions governmental investigations administrative proceedings regulatory actions mass arbitration or other similar actions our products could also cause illness or injury harm our reputation and subject us to litigation we are dependent on our vendors to ensure that the products we buy comply with all applicable safety standards however product liability personal injury or other claims may be asserted against us relating to product contamination product tampering mislabeling recall and other safety issues with respect to the products that we sell we seek but may not be successful in obtaining contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from our vendors and if we do not have adequate contractual indemnification or insurance available such product liability or safety claims could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations our ability to obtain the benefit of contractual indemnification from foreign vendors may be hindered by our ability to enforce contractual indemnification obligations against such vendors our litigationrelated expenses could increase as well which also could have a materially negative impact on our results of operations even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued 

for example we are currently defendants in state employmentrelated class and representative actions in demands for thousands of arbitrations and in litigation concerning injury from products the outcome of such matters is difficult to assess or quantify plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits or proceedings may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss may remain unknown for substantial periods of time in addition certain of these matters if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in an expense that may be material to our financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operations are required the cost to defend current and future litigation or proceedings including arbitrations may be significant there also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation including litigation related to product or food safety customer information and environmental or safety requirements which could negatively affect customer perception of our business regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable 

for a discussion of current legal matters please see “ item 3 legal proceedings ” and note 5 to our consolidated financial statements under the caption “contingencies” resolution of these matters if decided against the company could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations accrued liabilities or cash flows 

pressure from competitors may reduce our sales and profits 

the retail industry is highly competitive the marketplace is highly fragmented as many different retailers compete for market share by utilizing a variety of store formats and merchandising strategies including mobile and online shopping we expect competition to increase in the future there are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector some of our current or potential competitors have greater financial resources than we do we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors or that doing so will not require substantial capital expenditures please see “ item 1 business ” for further discussion of the effect of competition on our operations 

a downturn or changes in economic conditions including those caused by the coronavirus covid19 could impact our sales or profitability 

deterioration in economic conditions for example because of the coronavirus pandemic and government measures to combat it could reduce consumer spending or cause customers to shift their spending to products we either do not sell or do not sell as profitably adverse economic conditions could disrupt consumer spending and significantly reduce our sales decrease our inventory turnover cause greater markdowns or reduce our profitability due to lower margins other factors that could result in or exacerbate adverse economic conditions include a recession inflation higher unemployment consumer debt levels trade disputes as well as adverse weather conditions epidemics terrorism or international conflict 

furthermore factors that could adversely affect consumer disposable income could decrease our customers’ spending on products we sell factors that could reduce our customers’ disposable income and over which we exercise no influence include but are not limited to the pandemic and other adverse economic conditions described above as well as increases in fuel or other energy costs and interest rates lack of available credit higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws increasing healthcare costs and changes in decreases in or elimination of government subsidies such as unemployment and food assistance programs 

many of the factors identified above that affect disposable income as well as commodity rates transportation costs including the costs of diesel fuel costs of labor insurance and healthcare foreign exchange rate fluctuations lease costs barriers or increased costs associated with international trade and other economic factors also affect our ability to implement our corporate strategy effectively our cost of goods sold and our selling general and administrative expenses and may have other adverse consequences which we are unable to fully anticipate or control all of which may adversely affect our sales or profitability we have limited or no ability to control many of these factors 

changes in federal state or local law including regulations and interpretations or guidance thereunder or our failure to adequately estimate the impact of such changes or comply with such laws could increase our expenses expose us to legal risks or otherwise adversely affect us 

our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations the minimum wage has increased or is scheduled to increase in multiple states provinces and local jurisdictions significant legislative changes in regulations such as the healthcare legislation that impact our relationship with our workforce could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations changes in other regulatory areas such as consumer credit privacy and information security product and food safety worker safety or environmental protection among others could cause our expenses to increase or product recalls in addition if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations including wage and hour laws we could be subject to legal risk including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation which could adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition we are subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions in which we operate regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data for example the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which became effective on january 1 2020 imposes new responsibilities on us for the handling disclosure and deletion of personal information for consumers who reside in california the ccpa permits california to assess potentially significant fines for violating ccpa and creates a right for individuals to bring class action suits seeking damages for violations our efforts to comply with ccpa and other privacy and data protection laws may impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to increase over time and we could incur substantial penalties or be subject to litigation related to violation of existing or future data privacy laws and regulations 

the price of our common stock is subject to market and other conditions and may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors these factors some of which may be beyond our control include the perceived prospects and actual results of operations of our business changes in estimates of our results of operations by analysts investors or us trading activity by our large shareholders trading activity by sophisticated algorithms highfrequency trading our actual results of operations relative to estimates or expectations actions or announcements by us or our competitors litigation and judicial decisions legislative or regulatory actions or changes and changes in general economic or market conditions in addition the stock market in general has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations these market fluctuations could reduce the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our operating performance 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition limit our ability to obtain additional financing restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures 

in connection with our acquisition of family dollar we substantially increased our indebtedness which could adversely affect our ability to fulfill our obligations and have a negative impact on our financing options and liquidity position as of february 1 2020 our total indebtedness is 38 billion in addition we have 125 billion of additional borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility less amounts outstanding for letters of credit totaling 1369 million 

our level of debt could have significant consequences including the following 



 in addition our credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and accordingly our cost of capital our ratings reflect the opinions of the ratings agencies of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations there can be no assurance that we will achieve a particular rating or maintain a particular rating in the future 

the terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness may restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to pursue our business strategies and could adversely affect our capital resources financial condition and liquidity 

the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interests including among other things restrictions on our ability to 

 in addition certain of these agreements require us to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants our ability to satisfy these financial maintenance covenants can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot assure you that we will meet them 

a breach of the covenants under these agreements could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness which if not cured or waived could result in us having to repay our borrowings before their due dates such default may allow the debt holders to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies if we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or if we were to experience difficulty in refinancing the debt prior to maturity our results of operations or financial condition could be materially affected in addition an event of default under our credit facilities may permit the lenders under our credit facilities to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under such credit facilities in the event our lenders or holders of notes accelerate the repayment of such borrowings we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay such indebtedness 

as a result of these restrictions we may be 

 certain provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws could delay or discourage a change of control transaction that may be in a shareholder’s best interest 

our articles of incorporation and bylaws currently contain provisions that may delay or discourage a takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider in hisher best interest these provisions among other things 

 however we believe that these provisions allow our board of directors to negotiate a higher price in the event of a takeover attempt which would be in the best interest of our shareholders

 item 2 properties 

as of february 1 2020  we operated 15062 stores across the contiguous united states and the district of columbia and operated 226 stores within five canadian provinces 

the dollar tree segment includes 7505 stores operating under the dollar tree and dollar tree canada brands with stores predominantly ranging from 8000  10000 selling square feet the family dollar segment includes 7783 stores operating under the family dollar brand with stores predominantly ranging from 6000  8000 selling square feet for additional information on store counts and square footage by segment for the years ended february 1 2020 and february 2 2019 see “ item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” under the caption “overview” 

we lease the vast majority of our stores and expect to lease the majority of our new stores as we expand our leases typically provide for a short initial lease term generally five years with options to extend however in some cases we have initial lease terms of seven to fifteen years we believe this leasing strategy enhances our flexibility to pursue various expansion opportunities resulting from changing market conditions as current leases expire we believe that we will be able to obtain lease renewals if desired for present store locations or to obtain leases for equivalent or better locations in the same general area 

our network of distribution centers is strategically located throughout the united states to support our stores as of february 1 2020 we operated 24 distribution centers occupying a total of approximately 223 million square feet 13 of which are primarily dedicated to serving our dollar tree stores and 11 distribution centers primarily serve our family dollar stores our st george utah distribution center services both family dollar and dollar tree stores and we expect future distribution centers to be built with the capability to service both dollar tree and family dollar stores including the high velocity facility that is under construction in ocala florida in addition as a result of the h2 initiative we ship select product from our dollar tree distribution centers to our family dollar distribution centers and in fiscal 2019 we began to ship select product from our dollar tree distribution centers directly to certain of our family dollar stores we believe our distribution center network is currently capable of supporting approximately 295 billion in annual sales in the united states except for 04 million square feet of our distribution center in san bernardino california all of our distribution center capacity is owned 

each of our distribution centers contains advanced materials handling technologies including radiofrequency inventory tracking equipment and specialized information systems with the exception of three of our facilities each of our distribution centers in the united states also contains automated conveyor and sorting systems 

distribution services in canada are provided by a third party from facilities in british columbia and ontario 

during fiscal 2019 we consolidated our matthews north carolina store support center with our store support center in chesapeake virginia which is located in an approximately 05 million square foot office tower that we own in the summit pointe development in chesapeake virginia we continue to own our facility in matthews north carolina which occupies approximately 03 million square feet we are also developing additional parcels on our summit pointe property for mixeduse purposes

key events and recent developments 

several key events have had or are expected to have a significant effect on our operations they are listed below 



 overview 

we are a leading operator of more than 15200 retail discount stores and we conduct our operations in two reporting segments our dollar tree segment is the leading operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise at the fixed price of 100 our family dollar segment operates general merchandise retail discount stores providing consumers with a selection of competitivelypriced merchandise in convenient neighborhood stores 

our net sales are derived from the sale of merchandise two major factors tend to affect our net sales trends first is our success at opening new stores or adding new stores through mergers or acquisitions second is the performance of stores once they are open sales vary at our existing stores from one year to the next we refer to this as a change in comparable store net sales because we include only those stores that are open throughout both of the periods being compared beginning after the first fifteen months of operation we include sales from stores expanded or remodeled during the year in the calculation of comparable store net sales which has the effect of increasing our comparable store net sales the term ‘expanded’ also includes stores that are relocated stores that have been rebannered are considered to be new stores and are not included in the calculation of the comparable store net sales change until after the first fifteen months of operation under the new brand 

at february 1 2020  we operated stores in 48 states and the district of columbia as well as stores in five canadian provinces a breakdown of store counts and square footage by segment for the years ended february 1 2020 and february 2 2019 is as follows 



stores are included as rebanners when they close or open respectively comparable store net sales for dollar tree may be negatively affected when a family dollar store is rebannered near an existing dollar tree store 

the average size of stores opened in 2019 was approximately 8600 selling square feet or about 10640 gross square feet for the dollar tree segment and 7770 selling square feet or about 9630 gross square feet for the family dollar segment for 2020  we continue to plan to open stores that are approximately 8000  10000 selling square feet or about 10000  12000 gross square feet for the dollar tree segment and approximately 7000  9000 selling square feet or about 9000  11000 gross square feet for the family dollar segment we believe that these size stores are in the ranges of our optimal sizes operationally and give our customers a shopping environment which invites them to shop longer buy more and make return visits 

fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 which ended on february 1 2020 and february 2 2019 respectively each included 52 weeks fiscal 2017 ended on february 3 2018 and included 53 weeks commensurate with the retail calendar the 53rd week in 2017 added approximately 4066 million in sales 

in fiscal 2019  comparable store net sales increased by 18 on a constant currency basis as a result of increases in average ticket and customer count constant currency basis refers to the calculation excluding the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations we calculated the constant currency basis increase by translating the current year’s comparable store net sales in canada using the prior year’s currency exchange rates we believe that the constant currency basis provides a more accurate measure of comparable store net sales performance including the impact of canadian currency fluctuations comparable store net sales increased the same 18  on a constant currency basis comparable store net sales increased 23 in the dollar tree segment and increased 14 in the family dollar segment in fiscal 2019  in the dollar tree segment customer count increased 13 and average ticket increased 10  in the family dollar segment an increase of 18 in average ticket was partially offset by a decrease in customer count of 04  including the impact of currency comparable store net sales in the dollar tree segment increased 22  comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores which we include in the calculation and are negatively affected when we open new stores rebanner stores or expand stores near existing stores 

dollar tree initiatives 

we believe comparable store net sales continue to be positively affected by a number of our dollar tree initiatives we continued the rollout of frozen and refrigerated merchandise to more of our dollar tree stores in 2019 and as of february 1 2020  the dollar tree banner had frozen and refrigerated merchandise in approximately 6155 stores compared to approximately 5665 stores at february 2 2019  in 2018 we rolled out a new layout to a number of our dollar tree stores which we call our snack zone this layout highlights our immediate consumption snack offerings in the front of the store near the checkout areas as of february 1 2020  we have snack zone in more than 2100 dollar tree stores and we plan to incorporate snack zone in 500 new and existing stores in fiscal 2020 we believe these initiatives have and will continue to enable us to increase sales and earnings by increasing the number of shopping trips made by our customers we expect to open approximately 350 dollar tree stores in fiscal 2020 

family dollar initiatives 

as announced in march 2019 we executed a store optimization program in fiscal 2019 for our family dollar stores to improve performance included in that program was a rollout of a new model for both new and renovated family dollar stores internally known as h2 we tested the h2 model in 2018 on a limited basis with positive results this h2 model has significantly improved merchandise offerings including approximately 20 dollar tree 100 merchandise sections and establishing a minimum number of freezer and cooler doors throughout the store h2 has increased traffic and provided an average comparable store net sales lift in excess of 10 in the first year following renovation h2 performs well in a variety of locations and especially in locations where family dollar has been most challenged in the past we began 2019 with approximately 200 h2 stores and as of february 1 2020  we have approximately 1535 h2 stores we plan to renovate approximately 1250 stores to the h2 format in fiscal 2020 in addition we installed adult beverage product in approximately 620 stores in 2019 and plan to add it to approximately 1000 more stores in 2020 we believe the addition of adult beverage to our assortment will drive traffic to our stores we expect to open approximately 200 family dollar stores in fiscal 2020 which are expected to be in the h2 format 

as a part of the fiscal 2019 store optimization program at family dollar we closed 423 under performing stores and incurred approximately 425 million in store closure costs related to markdowns labor and the disposal of fixed assets in 2020 we plan to close approximately 100 stores at the end of their lease terms we also rebannered 200 family dollar stores to the dollar tree brand in 2019 

as part of our continuing integration of family dollar’s organization and support functions in 2019 we consolidated our store support centers in matthews north carolina and chesapeake virginia to our summit pointe development in chesapeake virginia approximately 30 percent of the matthews associates including more than 50 percent of the officers and directors invited 

to move to chesapeake agreed to do so the consolidation was substantially completed in fiscal 2019 and we incurred pretax expense of approximately 282 million in 2019 in connection with the consolidation 

other items 

additionally the following items have already impacted or could impact our business or results of operations during 2020 or in the future

results of operations 



fiscal year ended february 1 2020 compared to fiscal year ended february 2 2019 

net sales net sales increased 35 or 7875 million in 2019 compared to 2018  resulting from increases in comparable store net sales in the dollar tree and family dollar segments and sales of 7963 million at new stores partially offset by lost 

sales resulting from store closures primarily on the family dollar segment comparable store net sales increased 18 on a constant currency basis as a result of a 12 increase in average ticket and a 06 increase in customer count comparable store net sales increased the same 18 when including the impact of canadian currency fluctuations on a constant currency basis comparable store net sales increased 23 in the dollar tree segment and increased 14 in the family dollar segment comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores which we include in the calculation and are negatively affected when we open new stores rebanner stores or expand stores near existing stores 

gross profit gross profit increased 932 million or 13 to 70407 million in 2019 compared to 69475 million in 2018  gross profit margin decreased to 298 in 2019 from 304 in 2018  our gross profit margin decrease was due to the following 

 selling general and administrative expenses  selling general and administrative expenses decreased to 57785 million in 2019 from 78870 million in 2018  a decrease of 21085 million or 267 we recorded noncash goodwill impairment charges of 3130 million and 27270 million in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 respectively the goodwill impairments are discussed further in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements excluding the goodwill impairment charges in 2019 and 2018 selling general and administrative expenses increased 3055 million or 59 in 2019 and increased to 232 from 226 as a percentage of net sales this increase in selling general and administrative expenses was a result of the following 

 operating income loss  operating income was 12622 million in 2019 compared to an operating loss of 9395 million in 2018  excluding the noncash goodwill impairment charges in 2019 and 2018 operating income decreased to 15752 million in 2019 compared with 17875 million in 2018 and operating income margin decreased to 67 in 2019 from 78 in 2018 due to the reasons noted above

income taxes  our effective tax rate in 2019 was 247 compared to 215 in 2018  the increase in 2019 is a result of the effect of the goodwill impairment charges in 2019 and 2018 that are not tax deductible the 2019 effective tax rate includes the benefit of the reversal of a valuation allowance of 246 million the 2018 effective tax rate includes an additional benefit of 162 million related to the completion of our analysis of the tax effects of the tax cuts and jobs act “tcja” 

segment information 

we operate a chain of more than 15200 retail discount stores in 48 states and five canadian provinces our operations are conducted in two reporting business segments dollar tree and family dollar we define our segments as those operations whose results our chief operating decision maker “codm” regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources 

we measure the results of our segments using among other measures each segment’s net sales gross profit and operating income the codm reviews these metrics for each of our reporting segments we may revise the measurement of each segment’s 

operating income as determined by the information regularly reviewed by the codm if the measurement of a segment changes prior period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period’s presentation in the current year we identified corporate and support costs mainly store support center costs that are considered shared services and excluded these selling general and administrative costs from our two reporting business segments these costs include operating expenses for our store support centers in chesapeake virginia and matthews north carolina during fiscal 2019 we consolidated our matthews north carolina store support center with our store support center in chesapeake virginia we continue to own our facility in matthews north carolina prior year amounts have been reclassified to be comparable to the current year presentation

 operating income margin for the dollar tree segment decreased to 133 in 2019 compared to 141 in 2018  the decrease in operating income margin in 2019 was the result of lower gross profit margin as noted above and increased selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 214 in 2019 compared to 212 in 2018 as a result of the net of the following 

 family dollar

 liquidity and capital resources 

our business requires capital to build and open new stores expand our distribution network and operate and expand our existing stores our working capital requirements for existing stores are seasonal in nature and typically reach their peak in the months of september and october historically we have satisfied our seasonal working capital requirements for existing stores and have funded our store opening and distribution network expansion programs from internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities 

the following table compares cashflow related information for the years ended february 1 2020  february 2 2019 and february 3 2018  



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities increased 1038 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily as a result of lower cash payments for inventory partially offset by lower current year earnings net of noncash items and a decrease in accounts payable 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities increased 2035 million in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to increased capital expenditures related to the family dollar segment store optimization program including h2 renovations and rebanners partially offset by grant money received from state and local governments for our summit pointe development 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities decreased 8901 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to our debt refinancing in 2018 which resulted in debt payments exceeding the proceeds of longterm debt by 6569 million and the payment of 1553 million of debtissuance and extinguishment costs we also prepaid the 7820 million term loan facility in fiscal 2018 in fiscal 2019 we prepaid 5000 million of our 7500 million floating rate notes and paid 2000 million for 2019 stock repurchases

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates certain of our estimates require a high level of judgment and have the potential to have a material effect on the financial statements if actual results vary significantly from those estimates following is a discussion of the policies that we consider critical 

inventory valuation 

as discussed in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements under the caption “merchandise inventories” inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost determined on a weightedaverage basis cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weightedaverage basis under the retail inventory method the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated costtoretail ratio to the retail value of inventories the retail inventory method is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or net realizable value when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis 

inventory valuation methods require certain management estimates and judgments including estimates of future merchandise markdowns and shrink which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins the averaging required in applying the retail inventory method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns could under certain circumstances result in costs not being recorded in the proper period 

we estimate our markdown reserve based on the consideration of a variety of factors including but not limited to quantities of slow moving or seasonal carryover merchandise on hand historical markdown statistics and future merchandising plans the accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors some of which are outside of our control including changes in economic 

conditions and consumer buying trends historically we have not experienced significant differences in our estimated reserve for markdowns compared with actual results 

our accrual for shrink is based on the actual historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories adjusted if necessary for current economic conditions and business trends these estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger our physical inventory counts are generally taken between january and october of each year therefore the shrink accrual recorded at february 1 2020 is based on estimated shrink for most of 2019 including the fourth quarter the amounts recorded in the current year reflect the dollar tree and family dollar segments’ historical results we periodically adjust our shrink estimates to reflect our best estimates based on the factors described 

our management believes that our application of the retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value each year on a consistent basis 

selfinsurance liabilities 

the liabilities related to our selfinsurance programs for workers’ compensation and general liability are estimates that require judgment and the use of assumptions semiannually we obtain thirdparty actuarial valuations to aid in valuing the liabilities and in determining the amount to accrue during the year these actuarial valuations are estimates based on our historical loss development factors and the related accruals are adjusted as management’s estimates change 

management’s estimate for selfinsurance liabilities could vary from the ultimate loss sustained given the difficulty in predicting future events however historically the net total of these differences has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair values these assets are not amortized but are evaluated annually for impairment a more frequent evaluation is performed if events or circumstances indicate that impairment could have occurred such events or circumstances could include but are not limited to significant negative industry or economic trends unanticipated changes in the competitive environment and a significant sustained decline in the market price of our stock 

for purposes of our goodwill impairment evaluation the reporting units are family dollar dollar tree and dollar tree canada goodwill has been assigned to the reporting units based on prior business combinations related to the brands in the event a qualitative assessment of the fair value of a reporting unit indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount we then estimate the fair value using a combination of a market multiple method and a discounted cash flow method under the market multiple approach we estimate a fair value based on comparable companies’ market multiples of revenues and earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” and adjusted for a control premium under the discounted cash flow approach we project future cash flows which are discounted using a weightedaverage cost of capital analysis that reflects current market conditions adjusted for specific reporting unit risks primarily the uncertainty of achieving projected operating cash flows if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

the family dollar goodwill and trade name comprise a substantial portion of our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and management’s judgment utilized in the family dollar goodwill and trade name impairment evaluations is critical the computations require management to make estimates and assumptions and actual results may differ significantly particularly if there are significant adverse changes in the operating environment critical assumptions that are used as part of the family dollar goodwill evaluation include 



cash flows for our family dollar reporting unit the weightedaverage cost of capital used to discount the cash flows for our evaluation was 825 for our fiscal 2019 analysis 

indefinitelived intangible assets such as the family dollar trade name are not subject to amortization but are reviewed at least annually for impairment the indefinitelived intangible asset impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible assets to their carrying values we estimate the fair value of our trade name intangible asset based on an income approach using the relieffromroyalty method this approach is dependent upon a number of factors including estimates of future growth and trends royalty rates discount rates and other variables we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain the discount rate includes a premium compared to the discount used for the family dollar goodwill impairment evaluation due to the inherently higher risk profile of intangible assets compared to the overall reporting unit 

our impairment evaluations of goodwill resulted in noncash impairment charges of 3130 million and 273 billion in fiscal 2019 and 2018 respectively related to the family dollar reporting unit no goodwill impairment charges were recorded in fiscal 2017 our evaluation of the family dollar trade name did not result in impairment charges during fiscal 2019 2018 or 2017 based on the result of the evaluation the fair value of the family dollar trade name was within 15 of its carrying value 

for additional information on goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets including the related impairment evaluations refer to note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on uncertainties associated with the key assumptions and any potential events andor circumstances that could have a negative effect on the key assumptions please refer to “ item 1a risk factors ” and elsewhere within this “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” if our assumptions and related estimates change in the future we may be required to record impairment charges against earnings in future periods any impairment charges that we may take in the future could be material to our results of operations and financial condition

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

interest rate risk

the strong cash flows generated by our stores allow us to selffund infrastructure investment and new stores over the past five years cash flows from operating activities have exceeded capital expenditures

growth strategy 

store openings and square footage growth  the primary factors contributing to our net sales growth have been new store openings an active store expansion and remodel program and selective mergers and acquisitions in the last five years net sales increased at a compound annual growth rate of 276  including the addition of family dollar we expect that the majority of our future sales growth will come from new store openings in our dollar tree and family dollar segments and our store expansion and relocation program as well as our renovation initiatives 

at january 31 2015 we operated 5367 stores in the united states and canada at february 2 2019  we operated 15012  stores in 48 states and the district of columbia as well as 225  stores in canada our selling square footage increased from 

approximately 465 million square feet at january 31 2015 to 1201 million square feet at february 2 2019  our store growth has resulted from opening new stores and our july 2015 acquisition of more than 8200 family dollar stores 

our growth and productivity statistics are reported based on selling square footage because our management believes the use of selling square footage yields a more accurate measure of store productivity we expect to increase the selling square footage in our stores in the future by opening new stores in underserved markets and strategically increasing our presence in our existing markets via new store openings and store expansions expansions include store relocations in fiscal 2019 and beyond we plan to predominantly open dollar tree stores that are approximately 8000  10000 selling square feet and family dollar stores that are approximately 7000  9000 selling square feet we believe these store sizes allow us to achieve our objectives in the markets in which we plan to expand 

in addition to new store openings we plan to continue our dollar tree store expansion program to increase our net sales per store and take advantage of market opportunities we target stores for expansion based on the current sales per selling square foot and changes in market opportunities stores targeted for expansion are generally less than 7000 selling square feet in size store expansions generally increase the existing store size by approximately 2600 selling square feet at february 2 2019  3909  of our dollar tree stores totaling 64  of our dollar tree segment selling square footage were 8000 selling square feet or larger 

since 1995 we have added a total of 695 stores through several mergers and acquisitions excluding our acquisition of family dollar historically our acquisition strategy has been to target companies that have a similar single price point concept that have shown success in operations or companies that provide a strategic advantage we evaluate potential acquisition opportunities as they become available on july 6 2015 we completed our acquisition of family dollar which allowed us to create a diversified company with complementary business models 

from time to time we also acquire the rights to store leases through bankruptcy or other proceedings we will continue to take advantage of these opportunities as they arise depending upon several factors including their fit within our location and selling square footage size parameters 

merchandising and distribution expanding our customer base is important to our growth plans we plan to continue to stock our stores with a compelling mix of everchanging merchandise that our customers have come to appreciate consumable merchandise typically leads to more frequent return trips to our stores resulting in increased sales the presentation and display of merchandise in our stores are critical to communicating value to our customers and creating a more exciting shopping experience we believe our approach to visual merchandising results in higher sales volume and an environment that encourages impulse purchases 

a strong and efficient distribution network is critical to our ability to grow and to maintain a lowcost operating structure in 2018 we began construction on our morrow county ohio distribution center which will be 12 million square feet and automated and will initially serve stores in our dollar tree segment we expect this facility to be operational in the third quarter of 2019 additionally in 2018 we completed our warrensburg missouri distribution center which is 12 million square feet automated and currently serves stores in our dollar tree segment in 2016 we completed our cherokee county south carolina distribution center which is 15 million square feet automated and currently serves stores in our dollar tree segment in addition we expanded our dollar tree stockton california distribution center to 09 million square feet in fiscal 2019 we announced plans to construct a new 12 million square foot distribution center in rosenberg texas which is expected to provide service directly to dollar tree and family dollar stores and be operational by the summer of 2020 

our st george utah distribution center services both family dollar and dollar tree stores in addition we ship select product from our dollar tree distribution centers to our family dollar distribution centers and in fiscal 2019 we expect to ship select product from our dollar tree distribution centers directly to certain of our family dollar stores we believe our distribution center network is currently capable of supporting approximately 280 billion  in annual sales in the united states new distribution sites are strategically located to reduce stem miles maintain flexibility and improve efficiency in our store service areas we also are a party to an agreement which provides distribution services from two facilities in canada 

our dollar tree stores receive approximately 90  of their inventory from our distribution centers via contract carriers and our family dollar stores receive approximately 75  of their inventory from our distribution centers the remaining store inventory primarily perishable consumable items and other vendormaintained display items are delivered directly to our stores from vendors our family dollar stores receive approximately 13  of their merchandise from mclane company inc for more information on our distribution center network see “item 2 properties” beginning on page 20 of this form 10k 

competition 

our segment of the retail industry is fragmented and highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future we operate in the discount retail sector which is currently and is expected to continue to be highly competitive with respect to price store location merchandise quality assortment and presentation and customer service our competitors include singleprice dollar stores multiprice dollar stores mass merchandisers discount retailers drug stores convenience stores independentlyoperated discount stores and a wide variety of other retailers in addition several competitors have sections within their stores devoted to “one dollar” price point merchandise which further increases competition we believe we differentiate ourselves from other retailers by providing highvalue highquality lowcost merchandise in attractivelydesigned stores that are conveniently located our sales and profits could be reduced by increases in competition there are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector 

trademarks 

we are the owners of several federal service mark registrations including “dollar tree” the “dollar tree” logo and the dollar tree logo with a “1” in addition we own a registration for “dollar bill” we also acquired the rights to use trade names previously owned by everything’s a dollar a former competitor in the 100 price point industry several trade names were included in the purchase including the mark “everything’s 100” we also own the logo mark for “everything’s 1” with the acquisition of dollar giant we became the owner of several trademarks in canada with the acquisition of family dollar we became the owners of the trademarks “family dollar” “family dollar stores” and other names and designs of certain merchandise sold in family dollar stores we have federal trademark registrations for a number and variety of private labels that we use to market many of our product lines our trademark registrations have various expiration dates however assuming that the trademark registrations are properly maintained and renewed they have a perpetual duration 

employees 

we employed approximately 57200 fulltime and 124900 parttime associates on february 2 2019  parttime associates work an average of less than 30 hours per week the number of parttime associates fluctuates depending on seasonal needs we consider our relationship with our associates to be good and we have not experienced significant interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements 




 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk any failure to meet market expectations including our comparable store sales growth rate earnings and earnings per share or new store openings could cause the market price of our stock to decline you should carefully consider the specific risk factors listed below together with all other information included or incorporated in this report and other filings that we make from time to time with the sec including our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes any of the following risks may materialize and additional risks not known to us or that we now deem immaterial may arise in such event our business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected 

our profitability is vulnerable to cost increases 

future increases in costs such as wage and benefit costs the cost of merchandise duties merchandise loss due to theft damage or errors shipping rates freight costs fuel costs and store occupancy costs would reduce our profitability wage rates labor costs and inflation are expected to increase in 2019 the minimum wage has increased in certain states and local jurisdictions and is scheduled to increase further in 2019 

in our dollar tree segment we do not raise the sales price of our merchandise to offset cost increases because we are committed to selling primarily at the 100 price point to continue to provide value to the customer we are dependent on our ability to adjust our product assortment to operate more efficiently or to increase our comparable store net sales in order to offset cost increases we can give no assurance that we will be able to operate more efficiently or increase our comparable store net sales in the future although family dollar unlike dollar tree can raise the price of merchandise customers would buy fewer products if prices were to increase please see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” beginning on page 27 of this form 10k for further discussion of the effect of economic factors on our operations 

we could encounter additional disruptions in our distribution network and have encountered and expect to encounter additional costs in distributing merchandise such as freight cost increases due to the truck driver shortage and fuel cost increases 

our success is dependent on our ability to transport merchandise to our distribution centers and then ship it to our stores in a timely and costeffective manner we also rely on third parties to deliver certain merchandise directly from vendors to our stores we may not anticipate respond to or control all of the challenges of operating our receiving and distribution systems additionally if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments we could experience merchandise shortages that could lead to lost sales or increased costs some of the factors that could have an adverse effect on our distribution network or costs are 

• shipping disruption our oceanic shipping schedules may be disrupted or delayed from time to time 

 • efficient operations distribution centers and other aspects of our distribution network are difficult to operate 

efficiently and we have and could experience a reduction in operating efficiency 

• diesel fuel costs we have experienced volatility in diesel fuel costs over the past few years 

 • vulnerability to natural or manmade disasters a fire explosion or natural disaster at a port or any of our distribution 

facilities could result in a loss of merchandise and impair our ability to adequately stock our stores some facilities are 

  vulnerable to earthquakes hurricanes or tornadoes 

• labor disagreement labor disagreements disruptions or strikes may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise 

to our distribution centers or stores and increase costs 

• war terrorism and other events war and acts of terrorism in the united states the middle east or in china or other 

parts of asia where we buy a significant amount of our imported merchandise could disrupt our supply chain or 

increase our transportation costs 

• economic conditions suppliers may encounter financial or other difficulties 

• mclane company inc in fiscal 2018 we purchased approximately 13 of our merchandise for our family dollar 

segment through our relationship with mclane company inc which distributes consumable merchandise from multiple 

manufacturers a disruption in our relationship with mclane company inc could have a significant nearterm impact 

on our operations 

integrating family dollar’s operations with ours may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected including disruptions or the loss of key personnel in connection with the consolidation of the family dollar headquarters from north carolina to virginia 

the success of the family dollar acquisition the “acquisition” including anticipated benefits synergies and cost savings will depend in part on our ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses and cultures of the family dollar segment into our company the integration is not yet complete it is possible that the remaining integration process will take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of key employees higher than expected costs or unexpected costs ongoing diversion of management attention increased competition the disruption of our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers vendors and employees if we experience difficulties with the integration process the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected which could adversely affect our results of operations or business 

our business could be adversely affected if we fail to attract and retain qualified associates and key personnel 

our growth and performance is dependent on the skills experience and contributions of our associates executives and key personnel for both dollar tree and family dollar various factors including the acquisition the integration process constraints on overall labor availability wage rates regulatory or legislative impacts and benefit costs could impact our ability to attract and retain qualified associates at our stores distribution centers and corporate offices 

risks associated with our domestic and foreign suppliers including among others increased taxes duties tariffs or other restrictions on trade including section 301 tariffs imposed by the united states trade representative on imported chinese goods could adversely affect our financial performance 

we are dependent on our vendors to supply merchandise in a timely and efficient manner if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments due to financial or other difficulties we could experience merchandise shortages which could lead to lost sales or increased merchandise costs if alternative sources must be used 

we rely on the availability of imported goods at favorable wholesale prices merchandise imported directly accounts for approximately 40 to 42 of our dollar tree segment’s total retail value purchases and 17 to 19 of our family dollar segment’s total retail value purchases in addition we believe that a significant portion of our goods purchased from domestic vendors is imported china is the source of a substantial majority of our imports imported goods are generally less expensive than domestic goods and increase our profit margins a disruption in the flow of our imported merchandise or an increase in the cost of those goods may significantly decrease our profits risks associated with our reliance on imported goods may include disruptions in the flow of or increases in the cost of imported goods because of factors such as 

• an increase in duties tariffs or other restrictions on trade 

• raw material shortages work stoppages strikes and political unrest 

• economic crises and international disputes or conflicts 

• changes in currency exchange rates or policies and local economic conditions including inflation in the country of origin 

• potential changes to or withdrawal of the united states from international trade agreements 

• changes in leadership and the political climate in countries from which we import products and 

• failure of the united states to maintain normal trade relations with china and other countries 

we rely on computer and technology systems in our operations and any material failure inadequacy interruption or security failure of those systems could harm our ability to effectively operate and grow our business and could adversely affect our financial results 

we rely extensively on our computer and technology systems and in certain cases those of thirdparty service providers to manage inventory process credit card and customer transactions and summarize results our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the distribution and sale of our merchandise depends significantly on the reliability integrity and capacity of these systems and on our ability to successfully integrate the dollar tree and family dollar systems we also rely on thirdparty providers and platforms for some of these computer and technology systems and support 

although we have operational safeguards in place they may not be effective in preventing the failure of these systems or platforms to operate effectively and be available to us such failures may be caused by various factors including power outages catastrophic events physical theft computer and network failures inadequate or ineffective redundancy problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or platforms flaws in thirdparty software or services errors or improper use by our employees or third party service providers or a breach in the security of these systems or platforms including through computer viruses and cyberattacks 

if these systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process customer transactions and may receive negative publicity which could adversely affect our results of operations and business in addition remediation of any problems with our systems could result in significant unplanned expenses 

if we are unable to secure our customers’ credit card and confidential information or other private data relating to our associates suppliers or our business we could be subject to negative publicity costly government enforcement actions or private litigation and increased costs which could damage our business reputation and adversely affect our results of operations or business 

many of our information technology systems such as those we use for our pointofsale web and mobile platforms including online and mobile payment systems and for administrative functions including human resources payroll accounting and internal and external communications contain personal financial or other information that is entrusted to us by our customers and associates many of our information technology systems also contain proprietary and other confidential information related to our business and suppliers 

we have procedures and technology in place to safeguard our customers’ debit and credit card information our associates’ private data suppliers’ data and our business records and intellectual property and other sensitive information despite these measures cyberattacks are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and difficult to detect and we may be vulnerable to and unable to anticipate detect and appropriately respond to data security breaches and data loss including cybersecurity attacks if we or any thirdparty systems we use experience a data security breach we could be exposed to negative publicity government enforcement actions and private litigation in addition our reputation within the business community and with our customers may be affected which could result in our customers discontinuing the use of debit or credit cards in our stores or not shopping in our stores altogether 

moreover significant capital investments and other expenditures could also be required to remedy cybersecurity problems and prevent future security breaches including costs associated with additional security technologies personnel and experts for those whose data has been breached these costs which could be material could adversely impact our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred and may not meaningfully limit the success of future attempts to breach our information technology systems 

the unavailability of our information technology systems or the failure of those systems or software to perform as anticipated for any reason and any inability to respond to or recover from such an event could disrupt our business decrease performance and increase overhead costs if we are unable to secure our customers’ credit card and confidential information or other private data relating to our associates suppliers or our business we could be subject to negative publicity costly government enforcement actions or private litigation and increased costs any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or business 

our growth is dependent on our ability to increase sales in existing stores and to expand our square footage profitably 

existing store sales growth is critical to good operating results and is dependent on a variety of factors including merchandise quality relevance and availability store operations and customer satisfaction in addition increased competition could adversely affect our sales failure to meet our sales targets including in our renovated stores could result in our needing to record material noncash impairment charges related to our intangible assets 

our highest sales periods are during the christmas and easter seasons and we generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and our operating and net income during the fourth quarter in anticipation we stock extra inventory and hire many temporary employees to prepare our stores a reduction in sales during these periods could adversely affect our operating results particularly operating and net income to a greater extent than if a reduction occurred at other times of the year untimely merchandise delays due to receiving or distribution problems could have a similar effect when easter is observed earlier in the year the selling season is shorter and as a result our sales could be adversely affected easter was observed on april 16 2017 and april 1 2018 and will be observed on april 21 2019 

expanding our square footage profitably depends on a number of uncertainties including our ability to locate lease build out and open or expand stores in suitable locations on a timely basis under favorable economic terms obtaining an increasing number of profitable stores is an ever increasing challenge in addition our expansion is dependent upon thirdparty developers’ abilities to acquire land obtain financing and secure necessary permits and approvals we also open or expand stores within our established geographic markets where new or expanded stores may draw sales away from our existing stores we may not manage our expansion effectively and our failure to achieve our expansion plans could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we could incur losses due to impairment of longlived assets goodwill and intangible assets 

under us generally accepted accounting principles we review our longlived assets for impairment whenever economic events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable identifiable intangible assets with an indefinite useful life including goodwill are not amortized but are evaluated annually for impairment a more frequent evaluation is performed if events or circumstances indicate that impairment could have occurred 

in fiscal 2018 we recorded a 273 billion noncash pretax and aftertax goodwill impairment charge related to our family dollar reporting unit as a result of a strategic and operational reassessment of the family dollar segment following challenges that the business has experienced that have impacted our ability to grow the business at the originally estimated rate when the company made the acquisition in 2015 these challenges include slower sales growth increased freight costs driven by the driver shortage reinvestment in store labor and higher shrink in the future failure to address these challenges significant negative industry or general economic trends other disruptions to our business and unanticipated significant changes in our use of the assets may result in additional impairments to our goodwill intangible assets and other longlived assets we will continue to monitor key assumptions and other factors utilized in our goodwill impairment analysis and if business or other market conditions develop that are materially different than we currently anticipate we will conduct an additional impairment evaluation any reduction in or impairment of the value of goodwill or intangible assets will result in a charge against earnings which could have a material adverse impact on our reported results of operations and financial condition for additional information on goodwill impairments please refer to “note 3  goodwill and nonamortizing intangible assets” in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” beginning on page 42 of this form 10k 

our profitability is affected by the mix of products we sell 

our gross profit margin could decrease if we increase the proportion of higher cost goods we sell in the future imported merchandise is generally lower cost than domestic goods if duties increase increasing the cost of imported goods we may sell less imported goods and our profitability may suffer in recent years the percentage of our sales from higher cost consumable products has increased and we can give no assurance that this trend will not continue in addition carrying a greater proportion of higher cost goods can lead to higher shrink as a result our gross profit margin could decrease unless we are able to maintain our current merchandise cost sufficiently to offset any decrease in our product margin percentage we can give no assurance that we will be able to do so 

in our family dollar segment our success also depends on our ability to select and obtain sufficient quantities of relevant merchandise at prices that allow us to sell such merchandise at profitable and appropriate prices a sales price that is too high causes products to be less attractive to our customers and our sales at family dollar could suffer we are continuing to implement our everyday low price strategy at family dollar to drive customer loyalty and have a strategic pricing team to improve our value and to increase profitability inability to successfully implement our pricing strategies at family dollar could have a negative effect on our business 

in addition our family dollar segment has a substantial number of private brand items and the number of items has been increasing we believe our success in maintaining broad market acceptance of our private brands depends on many factors including our pricing costs quality and customer perception we may not achieve or maintain our expected sales for our private brands and as a result our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted additionally the increased number of private brands could negatively impact our existing relationships with our nonprivate brand suppliers 

our business or the value of our common stock could be negatively affected as a result of actions by activist shareholders 

we value constructive input from investors and regularly engage in dialogue with our shareholders regarding strategy and performance the board of directors and management team are committed to acting in the best interests of all of our shareholders there is no assurance that the actions taken by the board of directors and management in seeking to maintain constructive engagement with the company’s shareholders will be successful activist shareholders who disagree with the composition of the board of directors the company’s strategy or the way the company is managed may seek to effect change through various strategies that range from private engagement to publicity campaigns proxy contests efforts to force transactions not supported by the board of directors and litigation 

on january 2 2019 an activist shareholder starboard value and opportunity master fund ltd “starboard” delivered to us a notice of its intention to nominate seven director candidates for election to the board of directors at the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders of the company to be held june 13 2019 the “2019 annual meeting” if starboard is successful it is possible that starboardnominated directors could constitute a majority of the board of directors following the 2019 annual meeting starboard has also made public statements calling for changes to the company’s strategy 

responding to these actions may be costly and timeconsuming disrupt our operations divert the attention of our board of directors management and employees and interfere with the company’s store support center consolidation and the ability to execute its strategic plan and attract and retain qualified executive leadership a contested election could also require us to incur substantial legal and public relations fees and proxy solicitation expenses the perceived uncertainty as to the company’s future direction resulting from activist strategies could also affect the market price and volatility of the company’s common stock 

litigation may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to the risk of litigation involving employees consumers suppliers competitors shareholders government agencies or others through private actions class actions governmental investigations administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation our products could also cause illness or injury harm our reputation and subject us to litigation we are dependent on our vendors to ensure that the products we buy comply with all applicable safety standards however product liability personal injury or other claims may be asserted against us relating to product contamination product tampering mislabeling recall and other safety issues with respect to the products that we sell we seek but may not be successful in obtaining contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from our vendors and if we do not have adequate contractual indemnification or insurance available such product liability or safety claims could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations our ability to obtain the benefit of contractual indemnification from foreign vendors may be hindered by our ability to enforce contractual indemnification obligations against such vendors our litigation expenses could increase as well which also could have a materially negative impact on our results of operations even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued 

for example we are currently defendants in state employmentrelated class and representative actions and litigation concerning injury from products the outcome of litigation is difficult to assess or quantify plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits or proceedings may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss may remain unknown for substantial periods of time in addition certain of these matters if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in an expense that may be material to our financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operations are required the cost to defend current and future litigation or proceedings may be significant there also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation including litigation related to product or food safety customer information and environmental or safety requirements which could negatively affect customer perception of our business regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable 

for a discussion of current legal matters please see “item 3 legal proceedings” beginning on page 23 of this form 10k and “note 5  commitments and contingencies” under the caption “contingencies” in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” beginning on page 42 of this form 10k resolution of these matters if decided against the company could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations accrued liabilities or cash flows 

pressure from competitors may reduce our sales and profits 

the retail industry is highly competitive the marketplace is highly fragmented as many different retailers compete for market share by utilizing a variety of store formats and merchandising strategies including mobile and online shopping we expect competition to increase in the future there are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector some of our current or potential competitors have greater financial resources than we do we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors please see “item 1 business” beginning on page 6 of this form 10k for further discussion of the effect of competition on our operations 

a downturn or changes in economic conditions could impact our sales or profitability 

deterioration in economic conditions such as those caused by a recession inflation higher unemployment consumer debt levels trade disputes or international conflict as well as adverse weather conditions or terrorism could reduce consumer spending or cause customers to shift their spending to products we either do not sell or do not sell as profitably adverse economic conditions could disrupt consumer spending and significantly reduce our sales decrease our inventory turnover cause greater markdowns or reduce our profitability due to lower margins 

furthermore factors that could adversely affect consumer disposable income could decrease our customers’ spending on products we sell factors that could reduce our customers’ disposable income and over which we exercise no influence include 

but are not limited to the adverse economic conditions described above as well as increases in fuel or other energy costs and interest rates lack of available credit higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws concerns over government mandated participation in health insurance programs increasing healthcare costs and changes in decreases in or elimination of government subsidies such as unemployment and food assistance programs 

many of the factors identified above that affect disposable income as well as commodity rates transportation costs including the costs of diesel fuel costs of labor insurance and healthcare foreign exchange rate fluctuations lease costs barriers or increased costs associated with international trade and other economic factors also affect our ability to implement our corporate strategy effectively our cost of goods sold and our selling general and administrative expenses and may have other adverse consequences which we are unable to fully anticipate or control all of which may adversely affect our sales or profitability we have limited or no ability to control many of these factors 

changes in federal state or local law including regulations and interpretations or guidance thereunder or our failure to adequately estimate the impact of such changes or comply with such laws could increase our expenses expose us to legal risks or otherwise adversely affect us 

our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations the minimum wage has increased or is scheduled to increase in multiple states provinces and local jurisdictions significant legislative changes in regulations such as the healthcare legislation that impact our relationship with our workforce could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations changes in other regulatory areas such as consumer credit privacy and information security product and food safety worker safety or environmental protection among others could cause our expenses to increase or product recalls in addition if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations particularly wage and hour laws we could be subject to legal risk including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation which could adversely affect our results of operations 

the price of our common stock is subject to market and other conditions and may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors these factors some of which may be beyond our control include the perceived prospects and actual results of operations of our business changes in estimates of our results of operations by analysts investors or us trading activity by our large shareholders trading activity by sophisticated algorithms highfrequency trading our actual results of operations relative to estimates or expectations actions or announcements by us or our competitors litigation and judicial decisions legislative or regulatory actions or changes and changes in general economic or market conditions in addition the stock market in general has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations these market fluctuations could reduce the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our operating performance 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition limit our ability to obtain additional financing restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures 

in connection with the acquisition we substantially increased our indebtedness which could adversely affect our ability to fulfill our obligations and have a negative impact on our financing options and liquidity position as of february 2 2019  our total indebtedness is 43 billion in addition we have 125 billion  of additional borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility less amounts outstanding for letters of credit totaling 1829 million 

our high level of debt could have significant consequences including the following 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or 

other general corporate purposes 

• requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes 

thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 

• limiting our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all 

• imposing restrictive covenants on our operations 

• placing us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors carrying less debt and 

• making us more vulnerable to economic downturns and limiting our ability to withstand competitive pressures 

in addition our credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and accordingly our cost of capital our ratings reflect the opinions of the ratings agencies of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations there can be no assurance that we will achieve a particular rating or maintain a particular rating in the future 

the terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness may restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to pursue our business strategies and could adversely affect our capital resources financial condition and liquidity 

the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interests including among other things restrictions on our ability to 

• incur assume or guarantee additional indebtedness 

• declare or pay dividends or make other distributions with respect to or purchase or otherwise acquire or retire for 

value equity interests 

• make loans advances or other investments 

• incur liens 

• sell or otherwise dispose of assets including capital stock of subsidiaries 

• enter into sale and leaseback transactions 

• consolidate or merge with or into or sell all or substantially all of our assets to another person and 

• enter into transactions with affiliates 

in addition certain of these agreements require us to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants our ability to satisfy these financial maintenance covenants can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot assure you that we will meet them 

a breach of the covenants under these agreements could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness which if not cured or waived could result in us having to repay our borrowings before their due dates such default may allow the debt holders to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies if we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or if we were to experience difficulty in refinancing the debt prior to maturity our results of operations or financial condition could be materially affected in addition an event of default under our credit facilities may permit the lenders under our credit facilities to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under such credit facilities furthermore if we are unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our credit facilities those lenders may be able to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness in the event our lenders or holders of notes accelerate the repayment of such borrowings we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay such indebtedness 

as a result of these restrictions we may be 

• limited in how we conduct our business 

• unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns or 

• unable to compete effectively take advantage of new business opportunities or grow in accordance with our plans 

our variablerate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our annual debt service obligations to increase significantly 

certain of our indebtedness including borrowings under our revolving credit facility is subject to variable rates of interest and exposes us to interest rate risk interest rates while historically low have recently begun to increase when interest rates increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same and our net income decreases an increase decrease of 10 on the interest rate would result in an increase decrease of 75 million in annual interest expense although we may enter into interest rate swaps involving the exchange of floatingrate for fixedrate interest payments to reduce interest rate volatility we cannot assure you we will be able to do so 

certain provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws could delay or discourage a change of control transaction that may be in a shareholder’s best interest 

our articles of incorporation and bylaws currently contain provisions that may delay or discourage a takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider in hisher best interest these provisions among other things 

• provide that only the board of directors chairman or president may call special meetings of the shareholders 

• establish certain advance notice procedures for nominations of candidates for election as directors and for shareholder 

proposals to be considered at shareholders’ meetings and 

• permit the board of directors without further action of the shareholders to issue and fix the terms of preferred stock 

which may have rights senior to those of the common stock 

however we believe that these provisions allow our board of directors to negotiate a higher price in the event of a takeover attempt which would be in the best interest of our shareholders

we lease the vast majority of our stores and expect to lease the majority of our new stores as we expand our leases typically provide for a short initial lease term generally five  years with options to extend however in some cases we have initial lease terms of seven  to fifteen  years we believe this leasing strategy enhances our flexibility to pursue various expansion opportunities resulting from changing market conditions as current leases expire we believe that we will be able to obtain lease renewals if desired for present store locations or to obtain leases for equivalent or better locations in the same general area

key events and recent developments 

several key events have had or are expected to have a significant effect on our operations they are listed below 



 overview 

we are a leading operator of more than 15200  retail discount stores and we conduct our operations in two reporting segments our dollar tree segment is the leading operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise at the fixed price of 100 our family dollar segment operates general merchandise retail discount stores providing consumers with a selection of competitivelypriced merchandise in convenient neighborhood stores 

our net sales are derived from the sale of merchandise two major factors tend to affect our net sales trends first is our success at opening new stores or adding new stores through mergers or acquisitions second is the performance of stores once they are open sales vary at our existing stores from one year to the next we refer to this as a change in comparable store net sales because we include only those stores that are open throughout both of the periods being compared beginning after the first fifteen months of operation we include sales from stores expanded or remodeled during the year in the calculation of comparable store net sales which has the effect of increasing our comparable store net sales the term ‘expanded’ also includes stores that are relocated our acquired family dollar stores are included in the comparable store net sales calculation beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 however they are not included in the annual comparable store net sales calculation until fiscal 2017 stores that have been rebannered are considered to be new stores and are not included in the calculation of the comparable store net sales change until after the first fifteen months of operation under the new brand 

at february 2 2019  we operated stores in 48 states and the district of columbia as well as stores in five canadian provinces a breakdown of store counts and square footage by segment for the years ended february 2 2019  and february 3 2018  is as follows 



stores are included as rebanners when they close or open respectively comparable store net sales for dollar tree may be negatively affected when a family dollar store is rebannered near an existing dollar tree store 

the average size of stores opened in 2018  was approximately 8440  selling square feet or about 10480  gross square feet for the dollar tree segment and 7350  selling square feet or about 9110  gross square feet for the family dollar segment for 2019  we continue to plan to open stores that are approximately 8000   10000  selling square feet or about 10000   12000  gross square feet for the dollar tree segment and approximately 7000   9000  selling square feet or about 9000   11000  gross square feet for the family dollar segment we believe that these size stores are in the ranges of our optimal sizes operationally and give our customers a shopping environment which invites them to shop longer buy more and make return visits 

fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2016 which ended on february 2 2019 and january 28 2017 respectively each included 52 weeks fiscal 2017 ended on february 3 2018 and included 53 weeks commensurate with the retail calendar the 53rd week in 2017 added approximately 4066 million in sales 

in fiscal 2018  comparable store net sales increased by 17  on a constant currency basis this increase is based on a 52week comparison for both years constant currency basis refers to the calculation excluding the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations we calculated the constant currency basis increase by translating the current year’s comparable store net sales in canada using the prior year’s currency exchange rates we believe that the constant currency basis provides a more accurate measure of comparable store net sales performance including the impact of canadian currency fluctuations comparable store net sales increased the same 17  due to an increase in average ticket on a constant currency basis comparable store net sales increased 33  in the dollar tree segment and increased 01  in the family dollar segment in fiscal 2018  including the impact of currency comparable store net sales in the dollar tree segment increased the same 33  as a result of a 18 increase in average ticket and a 15 increase in customer count in the family dollar segment a 20 increase in average ticket was offset by a 19 decline in customer count comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores which we include in the calculation and are negatively affected when we open new stores rebanner stores or expand stores near existing stores 

we believe comparable store net sales continue to be positively affected by a number of our dollar tree initiatives we continued the rollout of frozen and refrigerated merchandise to more of our dollar tree stores in 2018 and as of february 2 2019  the dollar tree segment had frozen and refrigerated merchandise in approximately 5665  stores compared to approximately 5205  stores at february 3 2018  over the past year we rolled out a new layout to a number of our dollar tree stores which we call our snack zone this layout highlights our immediate consumption snack offerings in the front of the store near the checkout areas as of february 2 2019  we have this layout in approximately 930 dollar tree stores and we plan to implement snack zone in 1000 new and existing stores in fiscal 2019 we believe these initiatives have and will continue to enable us to increase sales and earnings by increasing the number of shopping trips made by our customers 

we are executing several initiatives in our family dollar stores to increase sales during fiscal 2018 we completed more than 500 family dollar renovations and have completed more than 875 renovations since launching this initiative in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 in march 2019 we announced plans for a store optimization program for family dollar this program consists of the following 



in fiscal 2019 in addition to the approximately 280 million in store closure costs we estimate that we will incur approximately 300 million of incremental initiative costs based on project count and velocity 

on september 18 2018 we announced that as part of our continuing integration of family dollar’s organization and support functions we plan to consolidate our store support centers in matthews north carolina and chesapeake virginia to our newlycompleted office tower in the summit pointe development in chesapeake virginia approximately 30 percent of the matthews associates including more than 50 percent of the officers and directors invited to move to chesapeake have agreed to do so we are currently hiring to replace the associates who are not moving we expect the consolidation to be completed by the fall of 2019 we expect to incur total pretax expense of approximately 370 million in connection with these plans in fiscal 2019 and we incurred approximately 73 million in 2018 

additionally the following items have already impacted or could impact our business or results of operations during 2019 or in the future 

 we must continue to control our merchandise costs inventory levels and our general and administrative expenses as increases in these items could negatively impact our operating results 

results of operations 



fiscal year ended february 2 2019  compared to fiscal year ended february 3 2018   

net sales  net sales increased 26 or 5778 million in 2018 compared to 2017 excluding the 53rd week in 2017 which accounted for approximately 4066 million of sales net sales increased 45 or 9844 million resulting from sales of 6185 million in new dollar tree and family dollar stores and increased comparable store net sales comparable store net sales increased 17 on a constant currency basis as a result of an increase in average ticket this increase is based on a 52week comparison for both periods comparable store net sales increased the same 17 when including the impact of canadian currency fluctuations on a constant currency basis comparable store net sales increased 33 in the dollar tree segment and increased 01 in the family dollar segment comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores which we include in the calculation and are negatively affected when we open new stores rebanner stores or expand stores near existing stores 

gross profit  gross profit decreased by 744 million or 11 to 69475 million in 2018 compared to 70219 million in 2017 gross profit margin decreased to 304 in 2018 from 316 in 2017 our gross profit margin decrease was due to the following 

 selling general and administrative expenses   selling general and administrative expenses increased to 78870 million in 2018 from 50228 million in 2017 an increase of 28642 million or 570 this increase is due primarily to a 273 billion noncash goodwill impairment charge recorded in fiscal 2018 related to the family dollar reporting unit as further discussed in “note 3  goodwill and nonamortizing intangible assets” in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” beginning on page 42 of this form 10k excluding the goodwill impairment charge selling general and administrative expenses increased 1372 million or 27 from the prior year fiscal 2017 included an 185 million receivable impairment related to our divestiture of certain family dollar stores as further discussed in “note 1  summary of significant accounting policies” within “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” beginning on page 42 of this form 10k and a 126 million increase to the dollar tree workers’ compensation reserves to record these on an undiscounted basis excluding the goodwill impairment in 2018 and the receivable impairment and workers’ compensation reserve increase in 2017 selling general and administrative expenses increased to 226 from 224 as a percentage of net sales due to the loss of leverage from the 53rd week of sales in 2017 and an increase of approximately 20 basis points in payroll costs store hourly payroll costs were higher as a result of the planned reinvestment of income tax savings partially offset by decreased incentive compensation costs resulting from lower earnings compared to targets in 2018 

operating income loss   an operating loss of 9395 million was incurred in 2018 compared to operating income of 19991 million in 2017 excluding the 273 billion noncash goodwill impairment charge in 2018 operating income decreased to 17875 million in 2018 compared with 19991 million in 2017 and operating income margin decreased to 78 in 2018 from 90 in 2017 due to the reasons noted above 

interest expense net interest expense net was 3700 million in 2018 compared to 3018 million in 2017 the increase is due to the prepayment premiums paid during the first quarter of 2018 of 1078 million and 65 million related to our redemption of the 575 acquisition notes due 2023 and term loan b2 respectively also in connection with our debt refinancing we accelerated the expensing of approximately 412 million of amortizable noncash deferred financing costs to the first quarter of 2018 these increases were partially offset by lower interest expense for the remainder of the year subsequent to the refinancing see “note 6  longterm debt” within “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” beginning on page 42 of this form 10k for additional detail on the refinancing of our longterm debt a 7820 million  term loan facility was included with the refinancing and it was scheduled to mature on april 19 2020 we repaid this entire amount in january 2019 and accelerated the expensing of approximately 15 million of amortizable noncash deferred financing costs 

income taxes   our effective tax rate in 2018 was expense of 215 compared to a benefit of 06 in 2017 the rate in 2018 is the result of the goodwill impairment charge not being tax deductible the 2018 effective tax rate includes an additional benefit 

of 162 million related to the completion of our analysis of the tax effects of the tax cuts and jobs act “tcja” the tax benefit in 2017 is the result of the tcja that was signed into law on december 22 2017 which lowered the statutory us federal income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective as of january 1 2018 the 2017 effective tax rate included the effect of a 5620 million benefit resulting from the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities to reflect the lower statutory federal rate of 21 the 2017 tax rate was also lower as a result of a reduction to the north carolina statutory tax rate and a reduction in the reserve for uncertain tax positions resulting from statute expirations and the reduction of interest accrued on method changes 

fiscal year ended february 3 2018  compared to fiscal year ended january 28 2017   

net sales  net sales increased 74 or 15263 million in 2017 compared to 2016 resulting from sales in new dollar tree and family dollar stores increased comparable store net sales and the 53rd week in 2017 which accounted for 4066 million of the increase comparable store net sales increased 19 on a constant currency basis as a result of increases in average ticket and customer count this increase is based on a 53week comparison for both periods comparable store net sales also increased 19 when adjusted for the impact of canadian currency fluctuations on a constant currency basis comparable store net sales increased 34 in the dollar tree segment and increased 04 in the family dollar segment comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores which we include in the calculation and are negatively affected when we open new stores rebanner stores or expand stores near existing stores 

gross profit  gross profit increased by 6272 million or 98 to 70219 million in 2017 compared to 63947 million in 2016 gross profit margin increased to 316 in 2017 from 308 in 2016 our gross profit margin improvement was primarily the result of the following 

 selling general and administrative expenses   selling general and administrative expenses increased to 50228 million in 2017 from 46899 million in 2016 an increase of 3329 million or 71 as a percentage of net sales selling general and administrative expenses were 226 in 2017 and 2016 fiscal 2017 includes an 185 million receivable impairment related to our divestiture of certain family dollar stores as further discussed in “note 1  summary of significant accounting policies” within “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” beginning on page 42 of this form 10k and a 126 million increase to the dollar tree workers’ compensation reserves to record these on an undiscounted basis excluding the receivable impairment and the workers’ compensation reserve increase selling general and administrative expenses decreased to 224 as a percentage of net sales due to the leverage from the 53rd week and the net of the following 

 operating income   operating income for 2017 increased to 19991 million compared with 17048 million in 2016 and operating income margin increased to 90 in 2017 from 82 in 2016 due to the reasons noted above 

interest expense net interest expense net was 3018 million in 2017 compared to 3755 million in 2016 the decrease is due to lower debt outstanding in 2017 as a result of 9901 million in prepayments in the third and fourth quarters of 2016 as well as the 5000 million prepayment in the second quarter of 2017 fiscal 2016 also includes the expensing of 266 million of amortizable noncash deferred financing costs and 26 million in fees associated with the refinancing of the new senior secured credit facilities on january 30 2018 we provided an irrevocable notice to the 2020 notes holders to call the 7500 million 2020 notes on march 1 2018 in connection with the early redemption of the 2020 notes we recorded a makewhole premium of 98 million which was payable on the call date of march 1 2018 

income taxes   our effective tax rate in 2017 was a benefit of 06 compared to expense of 326 in 2016 the decrease is due to the tcja that was signed into law on december 22 2017 which lowered the statutory us federal income tax rate from 35 to 21 and made numerous other law changes effective as of january 1 2018 our fiscal 2017 includes 34 days in calendar year 2018 therefore our overall 2017 statutory federal corporate tax rate is 337 the effective tax rate also includes a 5620 million benefit resulting from the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities to reflect the lower statutory federal rate of 21 the 2017 tax rate was also lower as a result of a reduction to the north carolina statutory tax rate which resulted in a decrease in the deferred tax liability related to the trade name intangible asset and a 99 million decrease in tax expense the 2017 rate also includes a reduction of approximately 56 million in the reserve for uncertain tax positions resulting from statute expirations and the reduction of interest accrued on method changes the tax rate in fiscal 2016 includes benefits resulting from a onetime election allowing the family dollar acquisition to be treated as an asset purchase for certain state tax purposes and a 10 decrease in north carolina’s state tax rate which resulted in a reduction in the deferred tax liability related to the trade name intangible asset

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates certain of our estimates require a high level of judgment and have the potential to have a material effect on the financial statements if actual results vary significantly from those estimates following is a discussion of the policies that we consider critical 

inventory valuation 

as discussed in “note 1  summary of significant accounting policies” under the caption “merchandise inventories” in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” beginning on page 42 of this form 10k inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost determined on a weightedaverage basis cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weightedaverage basis under the retail inventory method the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated costtoretail ratio to the retail value of inventories the retail inventory method is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or net realizable value when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis 

inventory valuation methods require certain management estimates and judgments including estimates of future merchandise markdowns and shrink which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins the averaging required in applying the retail inventory method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns could under certain circumstances result in costs not being recorded in the proper period 

we estimate our markdown reserve based on the consideration of a variety of factors including but not limited to quantities of slow moving or seasonal carryover merchandise on hand historical markdown statistics and future merchandising plans the accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors some of which are outside of our control including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends historically we have not experienced significant differences in our estimated reserve for markdowns compared with actual results 

our accrual for shrink is based on the actual historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories adjusted if necessary for current economic conditions and business trends these estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger our physical inventory counts are generally taken between january and october of each year therefore the shrink accrual recorded at february 2 2019 is based on estimated shrink for most of 2018 including the fourth quarter we have not experienced significant fluctuations in historical shrink the amounts recorded in the current year reflect the dollar tree and family dollar segments’ historical results we periodically adjust our shrink estimates to reflect our best estimates based on the factors described 

our management believes that our application of the retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value each year on a consistent basis 

selfinsurance liabilities 

the liabilities related to our selfinsurance programs for workers’ compensation and general liability are estimates that require judgment and the use of assumptions at least annually we obtain thirdparty actuarial valuations to aid in valuing the liabilities and in determining the amount to accrue during the year these actuarial valuations are estimates based on our historical loss development factors and the related accruals are adjusted as management’s estimates change 

management’s estimate for selfinsurance liabilities could vary from the ultimate loss sustained given the difficulty in predicting future events however historically the net total of these differences has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair values these assets are not amortized but are evaluated annually for impairment a more frequent evaluation is performed if events or circumstances indicate that impairment could have occurred such events or circumstances could include but are not limited to significant negative industry or economic trends unanticipated changes in the competitive environment and a significant sustained decline in the market price of our stock 

for purposes of our goodwill impairment evaluation the reporting units are family dollar dollar tree and dollar tree canada goodwill has been assigned to the reporting units based on prior business combinations related to the brands in the event a qualitative assessment of the fair value of a reporting unit indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount we then estimate the fair value using a combination of a market multiple method and a discounted cash flow method under the market multiple approach we estimate a fair value based on comparable companies’ market multiples of revenues and earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” and adjusted for a control premium under the discounted cash flow approach we project future cash flows which are discounted using a weightedaverage cost of capital analysis that reflects current market conditions adjusted for specific reporting unit risks primarily the uncertainty of achieving projected operating cash flows if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

the family dollar goodwill and trade name comprise a substantial portion of our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and management’s judgment utilized in the family dollar goodwill and trade name impairment evaluations is critical the computations require management to make estimates and assumptions and actual results may differ significantly particularly if there are significant adverse changes in the operating environment critical assumptions that are used as part of the family dollar goodwill evaluation include 

 indefinitelived intangible assets such as the family dollar trade name are not subject to amortization but are reviewed at least annually for impairment the indefinitelived intangible asset impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible assets to their carrying values we estimate the fair value of trade name intangible asset based on an income approach using the relieffromroyalty method this approach is dependent upon a number of factors including estimates of future growth and trends royalty rates discount rates and other variables we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain the discount rate includes a premium compared to the discount used for the family dollar goodwill impairment evaluation due to the inherently higher risk profile of intangible assets compared to the overall reporting unit 

our impairment evaluation of goodwill resulted in a 273 billion noncash impairment charge in fiscal 2018 related to the family dollar reporting unit no goodwill impairment charges were recorded in fiscal 2017 or 2016 our evaluation of the family dollar trade name did not result in impairment charges during fiscal 2018 2017 or 2016 the fair value of the family dollar trade name was within 1 of its carrying value 

for additional information on goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets including the related impairment evaluations refer to “note 3  goodwill and nonamortizing intangible assets” in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” beginning on page 42 of this form 10k for additional information on uncertainties associated with the key assumptions and any 

potential events andor circumstances that could have a negative effect on the key assumptions please refer to “item 1a risk factors” beginning on page 12 of this form 10k and elsewhere within this “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” if our assumptions and related estimates change in the future we may be required to record impairment charges against earnings in future periods any impairment charges that we may take in the future could be material to our results of operations and financial condition

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

interest rate risk 

at february 2 2019  our variable rate debt consists of our 7500 million senior floating rate notes due 2020 the “floating rate notes” which represents approximately 17 of our total debt borrowings under the floating rate notes bear interest at a floating rate reset quarterly equal to libor plus 70 basis points a 10 increase in libor would result in an annual increase in interest expense related to our floating rate notes of 75 million

deliver significant synergy opportunities through integration of family dollar our acquisition of family dollar has provided us with significant opportunities to achieve meaningful cost synergies we are executing a detailed integration plan and expect to achieve our target of approximately 300 million of estimated annual run‑rate cost synergies by july 2018 this synergy target does not account for onetime costs to achieve synergies investments back into the business integration costs or cost increases due to inflation vendor increases or other factors that are not caused by the business combination we expect to incur 300 million in onetime costs to achieve these target synergies sources of synergies include the following 



take advantage of significant whitespace opportunity over the past decade we have built a solid and scalable infrastructure which provides a strong foundation for our future growth we are committed to growing our combined business to take advantage of significant white space opportunities that we believe exist for both the dollar tree and family dollar store concepts using our proven real estate strategy across our combined business we intend to drive future store openings by capitalizing on data‑driven insights regarding location target customer profile competitive dynamics and cost structure over the longterm we believe that the market can support more than 10000 dollar tree stores and 15000 family dollar stores across the united states 

convenient locations and store size we focus primarily on opening new dollar tree stores in strip shopping centers anchored by large retailers who draw target customers we believe to be similar to ours our stores are successful in metropolitan areas midsized cities and small towns we open new family dollar stores in strip shopping centers freestanding buildings and downtown buildings the range of our store sizes 8000  10000 selling square feet for dollar tree and 6000  8000 selling square feet for family dollar allows us to target a particular location with a store that best suits that market and takes advantage of available real estate opportunities our stores are attractively designed and create an inviting atmosphere for shoppers by using bright lighting vibrant colors and decorative signs we enhance the store design with attractive merchandise displays we believe this design attracts new and repeat customers and enhances our image as both a destination and impulse purchase store

profitable stores with strong cash flow we maintain a disciplined costsensitive approach to store site selection in order to minimize the initial capital investment required and maximize our potential to generate high operating margins and strong cash flows we believe that our stores have a relatively small shopping radius which allows us to profitably concentrate multiple stores within a single market our ability to open new stores is dependent upon among other factors locating suitable sites and negotiating favorable lease terms 

the strong cash flows generated by our stores allow us to selffund infrastructure investment and new stores over the past five years cash flows from operating activities have exceeded capital expenditures

cost control  we believe that our substantial buying power and our flexibility in making sourcing decisions contributes to our successful purchasing strategy which includes targeted merchandise margin goals by category we also believe our ability to select quality merchandise helps to minimize markdowns we buy products on an orderbyorder basis and have no material longterm purchase contracts or other assurances of continued product supply or guaranteed product cost no vendor accounted for more than 10 of total merchandise purchased in any of the past five years 

our supply chain systems continue to provide us with valuable sales information to assist our buyers and improve merchandise allocation to our stores targeting our inventory levels has resulted in more efficient distribution and store operations 

information systems we believe that investments in technology help us to increase sales and control costs our inventory management system has allowed us to improve the efficiency of our supply chain enhance merchandise flow increase inventory turnover and control distribution and store operating costs it is also used to provide information to calculate our estimate of inventory cost under the retail inventory method which is widely used in the retail industry our automated replenishment system replenishes key items based on actual storelevel sales and inventory 

pointofsale data allows us to track sales and inventory by merchandise category at the store level and assists us in planning for future purchases of inventory we believe that this information allows us to ship the appropriate product to stores at the quantities commensurate with selling patterns using this pointofsale data to plan purchases has helped us manage our inventory levels

growth strategy 

store openings and square footage growth  the primary factors contributing to our net sales growth have been new store openings an active store expansion and remodel program and selective mergers and acquisitions in the last five years net sales increased at a compound annual growth rate of 298  including the addition of family dollar we expect that the majority of our future sales growth will come primarily from new store openings in our dollar tree and family dollar banners and from our store expansion and relocation program 

at february 1 2014 we operated 4992 stores in the united states and canada at february 3 2018 we operated 14610  stores in 48 states and the district of columbia as well as 225  stores in canada our selling square footage increased from approximately 432 million square feet at february 1 2014 to 1166 million square feet at february 3 2018 our store growth has resulted from opening new stores and our july 2015 acquisition of more than 8200 family dollar stores 

our growth and productivity statistics are reported based on selling square footage because our management believes the use of selling square footage yields a more accurate measure of store productivity we expect to increase the selling square footage in our stores in the future by opening new stores in underserved markets and strategically increasing our presence in our existing markets via new store openings and store expansions expansions include store relocations in fiscal 2018 and beyond we plan to predominantly open dollar tree stores that are approximately 8000  10000 selling square feet and family dollar stores that are approximately 6000  8000 selling square feet we believe these store sizes allow us to achieve our objectives in the markets in which we plan to expand 

in addition to new store openings we plan to continue our dollar tree store expansion program to increase our net sales per store and take advantage of market opportunities we target stores for expansion based on the current sales per selling square foot and changes in market opportunities stores targeted for expansion are generally less than 6000 selling square feet in size store expansions generally increase the existing store size by approximately 2750 selling square feet at february 3 2018 approximately 3686  of our dollar tree stores totaling 64  of our dollar tree banner selling square footage were 8000 selling square feet or larger 

since 1995 we have added a total of 695 stores through several mergers and acquisitions excluding our acquisition of family dollar historically our acquisition strategy has been to target companies that have a similar singleprice point concept that have shown success in operations or companies that provide a strategic advantage we evaluate potential acquisition opportunities as they become available on july 6 2015 we completed our acquisition of family dollar which allowed us to create a diversified company with complementary business models see note 2  acquisition in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” beginning on page 43 of this form 10k 

from time to time we also acquire the rights to store leases through bankruptcy or other proceedings we will continue to take advantage of these opportunities as they arise depending upon several factors including their fit within our location and selling square footage size parameters 

merchandising and distribution expanding our customer base is important to our growth plans we plan to continue to stock our stores with a compelling mix of everchanging merchandise that our customers have come to appreciate consumable merchandise typically leads to more frequent return trips to our stores resulting in increased sales the presentation and display of merchandise in our stores are critical to communicating value to our customers and creating a more exciting shopping experience we believe our approach to visual merchandising results in higher sales volume and an environment that encourages impulse purchases 

a strong and efficient distribution network is critical to our ability to grow and to maintain a lowcost operating structure in 2017 we began construction on our warrensburg missouri distribution center which will be 10 million square feet and automated and will serve stores in our dollar tree banner we expect this facility to be operational in the third quarter of 2018 in 2016 we completed our cherokee county south carolina distribution center which is 15 million square feet automated and serves stores in our dollar tree banner in addition we expanded our dollar tree stockton california distribution center to 09 million square feet we believe our distribution center network is currently capable of supporting approximately 265 billion  in annual sales in the united states new distribution sites are strategically located to reduce stem miles maintain flexibility and improve efficiency in our store service areas we also are a party to an agreement which provides distribution services from two facilities in canada 

our dollar tree stores receive approximately 90  of their inventory from our distribution centers via contract carriers and our family dollar stores receive approximately 75  of their inventory from our distribution centers the remaining store inventory primarily perishable consumable items and other vendormaintained display items are delivered directly to our stores from vendors our family dollar stores receive approximately 16  of their merchandise from mclane company inc for more information on our distribution center network see item 2 properties beginning on page 18 of this form 10k 

competition 

our segment of the retail industry is fragmented and highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future we operate in the discount retail sector which is currently and is expected to continue to be highly competitive with respect to price store location merchandise quality assortment and presentation and customer service our competitors include singleprice dollar stores multiprice dollar stores mass merchandisers discount retailers drug stores convenience stores independentlyoperated discount stores and a wide variety of other retailers in addition several competitors have sections within their stores devoted to one dollar price point merchandise which further increases competition we believe we differentiate ourselves from other retailers by providing highvalue highquality lowcost merchandise in attractivelydesigned stores that are conveniently located our sales and profits could be reduced by increases in competition there are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector 

trademarks 

we are the owners of several federal service mark registrations including dollar tree the dollar tree logo and the dollar tree logo with a 1 in addition we own a registration for dollar bill we also acquired the rights to use trade names previously owned by everythings a dollar a former competitor in the 100 price point industry several trade names were included in the purchase including the mark everythings 100 we also own the logo mark for everythings 1 with the acquisition of dollar giant we became the owner of several trademarks in canada with the acquisition of family dollar we became the owners of the trademarks family dollar family dollar stores and other names and designs of certain merchandise sold in family dollar stores we have federal trademark registrations for a number and variety of private labels that we use to market many of our product lines our trademark registrations have various expiration dates however assuming that the trademark registrations are properly maintained and renewed they have a perpetual duration 

employees 

we employed approximately 56300 fulltime and 119800 parttime associates on february 3 2018 parttime associates work an average of less than 30 hours per week the number of parttime associates fluctuates depending on seasonal needs we consider our relationship with our associates to be good and we have not experienced significant interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements 




 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk any failure to meet market expectations including our comparable store sales growth rate earnings and earnings per share or new store openings could cause the market price of our stock to decline you should carefully consider the specific risk factors listed below together with all other information included or incorporated in this report and other filings that we make from time to time with the sec including our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes any of the following risks may materialize and additional risks not known to us or that we now deem immaterial may arise in such event our business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected 

our profitability is vulnerable to cost increases 

future increases in costs such as wage and benefit costs the cost of merchandise duties merchandise loss due to theft damage or errors shipping rates freight costs fuel costs and store occupancy costs would reduce our profitability wage rates labor costs and inflation are expected to increase in 2018 the minimum wage has increased in certain states and local jurisdictions and is scheduled to increase further in 2018 

in our dollar tree segment we do not raise the sales price of our merchandise to offset cost increases because we are committed to selling primarily at the 100 price point to continue to provide value to the customer we are dependent on our ability to adjust our product assortment to operate more efficiently or to increase our comparable store net sales in order to offset cost increases we can give no assurance that we will be able to operate more efficiently or increase our comparable store net sales in the future although family dollar unlike dollar tree can raise the price of merchandise customers would buy fewer products if prices were to increase please see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations beginning on page 26 of this form 10k for further discussion of the effect of inflation and other economic factors on our operations 

risks associated with our domestic and foreign suppliers including among others increased taxes duties tariffs or other restrictions on trade could adversely affect our financial performance 

we are dependent on our vendors to supply merchandise in a timely and efficient manner if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments due to financial or other difficulties we could experience merchandise shortages which could lead to lost sales or increased merchandise costs if alternative sources must be used 

we rely on the availability of imported goods at favorable wholesale prices merchandise imported directly accounts for approximately 40  to 42  of our dollar tree segments total retail value purchases and 17 to 19 of our family dollar segments total retail value purchases in addition we believe that a significant portion of our goods purchased from domestic vendors is imported china is the source of a substantial majority of our imports imported goods are generally less expensive than domestic goods and increase our profit margins a disruption in the flow of our imported merchandise or an increase in the cost of those goods may significantly decrease our profits risks associated with our reliance on imported goods may include disruptions in the flow of or increases in the cost of imported goods because of factors such as 

• an increase in duties tariffs or other restrictions on trade 

• raw material shortages work stoppages strikes and political unrest 

• economic crises and international disputes or conflicts 

• changes in currency exchange rates or policies and local economic conditions including inflation in the country of origin 

• changes in leadership and the political climate in countries from which we import products and 

• failure of the united states to maintain normal trade relations with china and other countries 

integrating family dollar’s operations with ours may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits synergies and cost savings of the acquisition may not be realized 

the success of the family dollar acquisition the “acquisition” including anticipated benefits synergies and cost savings will depend in part on our ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses and cultures of the family dollar segment into our company the integration is not yet complete it is possible that the remaining integration process will take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of key employees higher than expected costs or unexpected costs ongoing diversion of management attention increased competition the disruption of our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers vendors and employees if we 

experience difficulties with the integration process the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected which could adversely affect our results of operations or business 

our business could be adversely affected if we fail to attract and retain qualified associates and key personnel 

our growth and performance is dependent on the skills experience and contributions of our associates executives and key personnel for both dollar tree and family dollar various factors including the acquisition the integration process constraints on overall labor availability wage rates regulatory or legislative impacts and benefit costs could impact our ability to attract and retain qualified associates at our stores distribution centers and corporate offices 

a significant disruption in our computer and technology systems could adversely affect our results of operation or business 

we rely extensively on our computer and technology systems and in certain cases those of thirdparty service providers to manage inventory process credit card and customer transactions and summarize results we are continuing to integrate the dollar tree and family dollar systems systems may be subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunication failures computer viruses security breaches and catastrophic or other events if these systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process customer transactions and may receive negative publicity which could adversely affect our results of operation or business 

if we are unable to secure our customers’ credit card and confidential information or other private data relating to our associates suppliers or our business we could be subject to negative publicity costly government enforcement actions or private litigation which could damage our business reputation and adversely affect our results of operation or business 

we have procedures and technology in place to safeguard our customers’ debit and credit card information our associates’ private data suppliers’ data and our business records and intellectual property and other sensitive information despite these measures cyberattacks are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and difficult to detect and we may be vulnerable to and unable to anticipate detect and appropriately respond to data security breaches and data loss including cybersecurity attacks other sophisticated retailers have recently suffered serious security breaches if we or any thirdparty systems we use experience a data security breach we could be exposed to negative publicity government enforcement actions private litigation or costly response measures in addition our reputation within the business community and with our customers may be affected which could result in our customers discontinuing the use of debit or credit cards in our stores or not shopping in our stores altogether in addition the unavailability of information systems or failure of these systems or software to perform as anticipated for any reason and any inability to respond to or recover from such an event could disrupt our business impact our customers and could result in decreased performance increased overhead costs and increased risk for liability any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our results of operation or business 

our growth is dependent on our ability to increase sales in existing stores and to expand our square footage profitably 

existing store sales growth is critical to good operating results and is dependent on a variety of factors including merchandise quality relevance and availability store operations and customer satisfaction in addition increased competition could adversely affect our sales our highest sales periods are during the christmas and easter seasons and we generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and our operating and net income during the fourth quarter in anticipation we stock extra inventory and hire many temporary employees to prepare our stores a reduction in sales during these periods could adversely affect our operating results particularly operating and net income to a greater extent than if a reduction occurred at other times of the year untimely merchandise delays due to receiving or distribution problems could have a similar effect when easter is observed earlier in the year the selling season is shorter and as a result our sales could be adversely affected easter was observed on march 27 2016 and april 16 2017 and will be observed on april 1 2018 

expanding our square footage profitably depends on a number of uncertainties including our ability to locate lease build out and open or expand stores in suitable locations on a timely basis under favorable economic terms obtaining an increasing number of profitable stores is an ever increasing challenge in addition our expansion is dependent upon thirdparty developers’ abilities to acquire land obtain financing and secure necessary permits and approvals we also open or expand stores within our established geographic markets where new or expanded stores may draw sales away from our existing stores we may not manage our expansion effectively and our failure to achieve our expansion plans could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we could encounter disruptions in our distribution network or additional costs in distributing merchandise 

our success is dependent on our ability to transport merchandise to our distribution centers and then ship it to our stores in a timely and costeffective manner we also rely on third parties to deliver certain merchandise directly from vendors to our stores 

we may not anticipate respond to or control all of the challenges of operating our receiving and distribution systems additionally if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments we could experience merchandise shortages that could lead to lost sales or increased costs some of the factors that could have an adverse effect on our distribution network or costs are 

• shipping disruption our oceanic shipping schedules may be disrupted or delayed from time to time 

 • efficient operations distribution centers and other aspects of our distribution network are difficult to operate 

efficiently and we could experience a reduction in operating efficiency 

• diesel fuel costs we have experienced volatility in diesel fuel costs over the past few years 

• vulnerability to natural or manmade disasters a fire explosion or natural disaster at a port or any of our distribution 

facilities could result in a loss of merchandise and impair our ability to adequately stock our stores some facilities are 

  vulnerable to earthquakes hurricanes or tornadoes 

• labor disagreement labor disagreements disruptions or strikes may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise 

to our distribution centers or stores and increase costs 

• war terrorism and other events war and acts of terrorism in the united states the middle east or in china or other 

parts of asia where we buy a significant amount of our imported merchandise could disrupt our supply chain or 

increase our transportation costs 

• economic conditions suppliers may encounter financial or other difficulties 

our profitability is affected by the mix of products we sell 

our gross profit margin could decrease if we increase the proportion of higher cost goods we sell in the future imported merchandise is generally lower cost than domestic goods if duties increase increasing the cost of imported goods we may sell less imported goods and our profitability may suffer in recent years the percentage of our sales from higher cost consumable products has increased and we can give no assurance that this trend will not continue as a result our gross profit margin could decrease unless we are able to maintain our current merchandise cost sufficiently to offset any decrease in our product margin percentage we can give no assurance that we will be able to do so 

in our family dollar segment our success also depends on our ability to select and obtain sufficient quantities of relevant merchandise at prices that allow us to sell such merchandise at profitable and appropriate prices a sales price that is too high causes products to be less attractive to our customers and our sales at family dollar could suffer we are continuing to implement our everyday low price strategy at family dollar to drive customer loyalty and have a strategic pricing team to improve our value and to increase profitability inability to successfully implement our pricing strategies at family dollar could have a negative effect on our business 

in addition our family dollar segment has a substantial number of private brand items and the number of items has been increasing we believe our success in maintaining broad market acceptance of our private brands depends on many factors including our pricing costs quality and customer perception we may not achieve or maintain our expected sales for our private brands and as a result our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted additionally the increased number of private brands could negatively impact our existing relationships with our nonprivate brand suppliers 

litigation may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to the risk of litigation involving employees consumers suppliers competitors shareholders government agencies or others through private actions class actions governmental investigations administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation our products could also cause illness or injury harm our reputation and subject us to litigation we are dependent on our vendors to ensure that the products we buy comply with all applicable safety standards however product liability personal injury or other claims may be asserted against us relating to product contamination product tampering mislabeling recall and other safety issues with respect to the products that we sell we seek but may not be successful in obtaining contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from our vendors and if we do not have adequate contractual indemnification or insurance available such product liability or safety claims could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations our ability to obtain the benefit of contractual indemnification from foreign vendors may be hindered by our ability to enforce contractual indemnification obligations against such vendors our litigation expenses could increase as well which also 

could have a materially negative impact on our results of operations even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued 

for example we are currently defendants in national and state employmentrelated class and collective actions and litigation concerning injury from products the outcome of litigation is difficult to assess or quantify plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits or proceedings may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss may remain unknown for substantial periods of time in addition certain of these matters if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in an expense that may be material to our financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operation are required the cost to defend current and future litigation or proceedings may be significant there also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation including litigation related to product or food safety customer information and environmental or safety requirements which could negatively affect customer perception of our business regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable 

for a discussion of current legal matters please see item 3 legal proceedings beginning on page 21 of this form 10k and note 5  commitments and contingencies under the caption contingencies in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data beginning on page 43 of this form 10k resolution of these matters if decided against the company could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations accrued liabilities or cash flows 

pressure from competitors may reduce our sales and profits 

the retail industry is highly competitive the marketplace is highly fragmented as many different retailers compete for market share by utilizing a variety of store formats and merchandising strategies including mobile and online shopping we expect competition to increase in the future there are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector some of our current or potential competitors have greater financial resources than we do we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors please see item 1 business beginning on page 6 of this form 10k for further discussion of the effect of competition on our operations 

a downturn or changes in economic conditions could impact our sales or profitability 

deterioration in economic conditions such as those caused by a recession inflation higher unemployment consumer debt levels trade disputes or international conflict as well as adverse weather conditions or terrorism could reduce consumer spending or cause customers to shift their spending to products we either do not sell or do not sell as profitably adverse economic conditions could disrupt consumer spending and significantly reduce our sales decrease our inventory turnover cause greater markdowns or reduce our profitability due to lower margins 

furthermore factors that could adversely affect consumer disposable income could decrease our customers’ spending on products we sell factors that could reduce our customers’ disposable income and over which we exercise no influence include but are not limited to adverse economic conditions described above as well as increases in fuel or other energy costs and interest rates lack of available credit higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws concerns over government mandated participation in health insurance programs increasing healthcare costs and changes in decreases in or elimination of government subsidies such as unemployment and food assistance programs 

many of the factors identified above that affect disposable income as well as commodity rates transportation costs including the costs of diesel fuel costs of labor insurance and healthcare foreign exchange rate fluctuations lease costs barriers or increased costs associated with international trade and other economic factors also affect our ability to implement our corporate strategy effectively our cost of goods sold and our selling general and administrative expenses and may have other adverse consequences which we are unable to fully anticipate or control all of which may adversely affect our sales or profitability we have limited or no ability to control many of these factors 

changes in federal state or local law or our failure to comply with such laws could increase our expenses and expose us to legal risks 

our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations the minimum wage has increased or is scheduled to increase in multiple states provinces and local jurisdictions significant legislative changes in regulations such as the healthcare legislation that impact our relationship with our workforce could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations changes in other regulatory areas such as consumer credit privacy and information security product and food safety worker safety or environmental protection among others could cause our expenses to increase or product recalls in addition if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations particularly wage and hour laws we could be subject to legal risk including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation which could adversely affect our results of operations 

the price of our common stock is subject to market and other conditions and may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors these factors some of which may be beyond our control include the perceived prospects and actual results of operation of our business changes in estimates of our results of operation by analysts investors or us trading activity by our large shareholders trading activity by sophisticated algorithms highfrequency trading our actual results of operation relative to estimates or expectations actions or announcements by us or our competitors litigation and judicial decisions legislative or regulatory actions or changes and changes in general economic or market conditions in addition the stock market in general has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations these market fluctuations could reduce the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our operating performance 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition limit our ability to obtain additional financing restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures 

in connection with the acquisition we substantially increased our indebtedness which could adversely affect our ability to fulfill our obligations and have a negative impact on our financing options and liquidity position as of february 3 2018  our total indebtedness is 57327 million in addition we have 12500 million  of additional borrowing availability under our tranche a revolving credit facility less amounts outstanding for letters of credit totaling 1582 million 

our high level of debt could have significant consequences including the following 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or 

other general corporate purposes 

• requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes 

thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 

• limiting our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all 

• imposing restrictive covenants on our operations 

• placing us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors carrying less debt and 

• making us more vulnerable to economic downturns and limiting our ability to withstand competitive pressures 

in addition our credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and accordingly our cost of capital our ratings reflect the opinions of the ratings agencies of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations there can be no assurance that we will achieve a particular rating or maintain a particular rating in the future 

the terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness may restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to pursue our business strategies and could adversely affect our capital resources financial condition and liquidity 

the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interests including among other things restrictions on our ability to 

• incur assume or guarantee additional indebtedness 

• declare or pay dividends or make other distributions with respect to or purchase or otherwise acquire or retire for 

value equity interests 

• make principal payments on or redeem or repurchase subordinated debt 

• make loans advances or other investments 

• incur liens 

• sell or otherwise dispose of assets including capital stock of subsidiaries 

• enter into sale and leaseback transactions 

• consolidate or merge with or into or sell all or substantially all of our assets to another person and

in addition certain of these agreements require us to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants our ability to satisfy these financial maintenance covenants can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot assure you that we will meet them 

a breach of the covenants under these agreements could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness which if not cured or waived could result in us having to repay our borrowings before their due dates such default may allow the debt holders to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies if we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or if we were to experience difficulty in refinancing the debt prior to maturity our results of operations or financial condition could be materially affected in addition an event of default under our credit facilities may permit the lenders under our credit facilities to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under such credit facilities furthermore if we are unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our credit facilities those lenders may be able to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness in the event our lenders or holders of notes accelerate the repayment of such borrowings we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay such indebtedness 

as a result of these restrictions we may be 

• limited in how we conduct our business 

• unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns or 

• unable to compete effectively take advantage of new business opportunities or grow in accordance with our plans 

our variablerate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our annual debt service obligations to increase significantly 

certain of our indebtedness including borrowings under our tranche a revolving credit facility is subject to variable rates of interest and exposes us to interest rate risk interest rates while historically low have recently begun to increase when interest rates increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same and our net income decreases an increase decrease of 10 on the interest rate would result in an increase decrease of 153 million in annual interest expense although we may enter into interest rate swaps involving the exchange of floating for fixedrate interest payments to reduce interest rate volatility we cannot assure you we will be able to do so 

certain provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws could delay or discourage a change of control transaction that may be in a shareholder’s best interest 

our articles of incorporation and bylaws currently contain provisions that may delay or discourage a takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider in his best interest these provisions among other things 

• provide that only the board of directors chairman or president may call special meetings of the shareholders 

• establish certain advance notice procedures for nominations of candidates for election as directors and for shareholder 

proposals to be considered at shareholders’ meetings and 

• permit the board of directors without further action of the shareholders to issue and fix the terms of preferred stock 

which may have rights senior to those of the common stock 

however we believe that these provisions allow our board of directors to negotiate a higher price in the event of a takeover attempt which would be in the best interest of our shareholders

stores 

as of february 3 2018  we operated 14835  stores in 48  states and the district of columbia and five  canadian provinces as detailed below 





we lease the vast majority of our stores and expect to lease the majority of our new stores as we expand our leases typically provide for a short initial lease term generally five  years with options to extend however in some cases we have initial lease terms of seven  to fifteen  years we believe this leasing strategy enhances our flexibility to pursue various expansion opportunities resulting from changing market conditions as current leases expire we believe that we will be able to obtain lease renewals if desired for present store locations or to obtain leases for equivalent or better locations in the same general area

key events and recent developments 

several key events have had or are expected to have a significant effect on our operations they are listed below 



 overview 

we are a leading operator of more than 14800  discount retail stores and we conduct our operations in two reporting segments our dollar tree segment is the leading operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise at the fixed price of 100 our family dollar segment operates general merchandise retail discount stores providing consumers with a selection of competitivelypriced merchandise in convenient neighborhood stores 

our net sales are derived from the sale of merchandise two major factors tend to affect our net sales trends first is our success at opening new stores or adding new stores through mergers or acquisitions second is the performance of stores once they are open sales vary at our existing stores from one year to the next we refer to this as a change in comparable store net sales because we include only those stores that are open throughout both of the periods being compared beginning after the first fifteen months of operation we include sales from stores expanded during the year in the calculation of comparable store net sales which has the effect of increasing our comparable store net sales the term expanded also includes stores that are relocated our acquired family dollar stores are included in the comparable store net sales calculation beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 however they are not included in the annual comparable store net sales calculation until fiscal 2017 stores that have been rebannered are considered to be new stores and are not included in the calculation of the comparable store net sales change until after the first fifteen months of operation under the new banner 

at february 3 2018  we operated stores in 48 states and the district of columbia as well as stores in five canadian provinces a breakdown of store counts and square footage by segment for the years ended february 3 2018  and january 28 2017  is as follows 



stores are included as rebanners when they close or open respectively comparable store net sales for dollar tree may be negatively affected when a family dollar store is rebannered near an existing dollar tree store 

the average size of stores opened in 2017  was approximately 8180  selling square feet or about 10180  gross square feet for the dollar tree segment and 7160  selling square feet or about 8860  gross square feet for the family dollar segment for 2018  we continue to plan to open stores that are approximately 8000   10000  selling square feet or about 10000   12000  gross square feet for the dollar tree segment and approximately 6000   8000  selling square feet or about 7000   9000  gross square feet for the family dollar segment we believe that these size stores are our optimal sizes operationally and give our customers a shopping environment which invites them to shop longer buy more and make return visits which increases our customer traffic 

fiscal 2017  ended on february 3 2018 and included 53 weeks commensurate with the retail calendar the 53rd week in 2017 added approximately 4066 million in sales fiscal 2016  and fiscal 2015  which ended on january 28 2017  and january 30 2016  respectively each included 52 weeks 

in fiscal 2017  comparable store net sales increased by 19  on a constant currency basis this increase is based on a 53week comparison for both years constant currency basis refers to the calculation excluding the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations we calculated the constant currency basis increase by translating the current year’s comparable store net sales in canada using the prior year’s currency exchange rates we believe that the constant currency basis provides a more accurate measure of comparable store net sales performance including the impact of currency comparable store net sales increased the same 19  as a result of a 09  increase in the number of transactions and a 10  increase in average ticket on a constant currency basis comparable store net sales increased 34  in the dollar tree segment and increased 04  in the family dollar segment in fiscal 2017  comparable store net sales in the dollar tree segment increased 35  when adjusted for the impact of canadian currency fluctuations comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores which we include in the calculation and are negatively affected when we open new stores rebanner stores or expand stores near existing stores 

we believe comparable store net sales continued to be positively affected by a number of our dollar tree initiatives as debit and credit card penetration continued to increase in 2017  and we continued the rollout of frozen and refrigerated merchandise to more of our dollar tree stores at february 3 2018  the dollar tree segment had frozen and refrigerated merchandise in approximately 5205  stores which includes rebannered stores compared to approximately 4785  stores at january 28 2017  we believe that the addition of frozen and refrigerated product enables us to increase sales and earnings by increasing the number of shopping trips made by our customers 

we believe our initiatives at family dollar are positively affecting the comparable store net sales performance among these is a store renovation initiative during fiscal 2017  we completed approximately 375 family dollar renovations these renovations have focused on creating an exciting and more productive family dollar shopping experience renovations bring some of the oldest stores to our brand standard including more productive endcaps highlighting more relevant and prominent seasonal offerings assortment expansions in beverage and snacks hair care and food in coolers and freezers category adjacencies and updating our frontend checkout are also part of the renovation program we are making a number of improvements to the conditions of our stores to provide our customers with a consistent and improved shopping experience in addition we have focused on rebranding our private brand labels in our stores these private brands are being developed to provide national brand comparable quality and great values for our customers as part of our compare and save marketing program we are adding additional coolers and freezers to facilitate expansion of our product offerings 

our pointofsale technology provides us with valuable sales and inventory information to assist our buyers and improve our merchandise allocation to our stores we believe that this has enabled us to better manage our inventory flow in our stores resulting in more efficient distribution and store operations 

we must continue to control our merchandise costs inventory levels and our general and administrative expenses as increases in these items could negatively impact our operating results 

acquisition and divestiture 

on july 6 2015 we completed the acquisition and family dollar became a direct whollyowned subsidiary under the acquisition the family dollar shareholders received 5960 in cash and 02484 shares of our common stock for each share of family dollar common stock they owned plus cash in lieu of fractional shares the merger consideration 

as of the acquisition date each outstanding performance share right of family dollar common stock was canceled in exchange for the right of the holder to receive the merger consideration the psr payment the aggregate amount we paid for the merger consideration and psr payment was 68 billion in cash and we issued 285 million shares of our common stock valued at 23 billion based on the closing price of our common stock on july 2 2015 

for a complete description of the acquisition refer to our current report on form 8k filed with the sec on july 8 2015 

we incurred 392 million in acquisitionrelated expenses in 2015 excluding acquisitionrelated interest expense we also expended approximately 1657 million in capitalizable debtissuance costs related to the financing of the acquisition and 615 million and 788 million of debtissuance costs was included as a reduction in longterm debt net excluding current portion at february 3 2018 and january 28 2017 respectively 

we expect to achieve approximately 300 million in annual cost savings synergies by july 2018 and we will incur 300 million in onetime costs to achieve these synergies 

in 2015 we completed the offering of 325 billion of senior notes and entered into a credit facility and term loan providing for 62 billion in senior secured credit facilities see liquidity and capital resources for a further discussion of these transactions 

in connection with the acquisition we divested 330 family dollar stores to settle federal trade commission charges that the acquisition would be anticompetitive in certain local markets the 330 family dollar stores 325 of which were open at the time of the divestiture represented approximately 455 million of annual operating income in accordance with purchase accounting the net effect of the divestiture on our assets and liabilities is fully reflected in the table summarizing the estimates of fair value set forth in note 2  acquisition 

in the first and second quarters of 2017 we evaluated the collectability of certain receivables from dollar express relating to the divestiture based on information then available we determined that outstanding amounts totaling 535 million were not recoverable and recorded impairment charges to write down the receivables to zero in the fourth quarter of 2017 a settlement was reached under which sycamore partners and dollar express paid us 350 million which resulted in a partial reversal of the receivables impairment in our fiscal fourth quarter 2017 

results of operations 



fiscal year ended february 3 2018  compared to fiscal year ended january 28 2017   

net sales  net sales increased 74 or 15263 million in 2017 compared to 2016 resulting from sales in new dollar tree and family dollar stores increased comparable store net sales and the 53rd week in 2017 which accounted for 4066 million of the increase comparable store net sales increased 19 on a constant currency basis as a result of increases in average ticket and customer count this increase is based on a 53week comparison for both periods comparable store net sales also increased 19 when adjusted for the impact of canadian currency fluctuations on a constant currency basis comparable store net sales increased 34 in the dollar tree segment and increased 04 in the family dollar segment comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores which we include in the calculation and are negatively affected when we open new stores rebanner stores or expand stores near existing stores 

gross profit  gross profit increased by 6272 million or 98 to 70219 million in 2017 compared to 63947 million in 2016 gross profit margin increased to 316 in 2017 from 308 in 2016 our gross profit margin improvement was primarily the result of lower merchandise costs as a percentage of sales resulting from improved markon in fiscal 2017 fewer markdowns in the current year and leverage from the sales in the 53rd week 

selling general and administrative expenses   selling general and administrative expenses increased to 50228 million in 2017 from 46899 million in 2016 an increase of 3329 million or 71 as a percentage of sales selling general and administrative expenses were 226 in 2017 and 2016 fiscal 2017 includes an 185 million receivable impairment related to the divestiture and a 126 million increase to the dollar tree workers compensation reserves to record these on an undiscounted basis excluding the receivable impairment and the workers compensation reserve increase selling general and administrative expenses decreased to 224 as a percentage of sales due to the leverage from the 53rd week and the net of the following 

 operating income   operating income for 2017 increased to 19991 million compared with 17048 million in 2016 and operating income margin increased to 90 in 2017 from 82 in 2016 

in the fourth quarter of 2017 we benefited with respect to the tcja we expect to continue to benefit going forward and estimate the benefit to be approximately 2500 million in fiscal 2018 we plan to reinvest approximately 1000 million of this tax savings into the following 

 this reinvestment could reduce operating income margin in 2018 

interest expense net interest expense net was 3018 million in 2017 compared to 3755 million in 2016 the decrease is due to lower debt outstanding in the current year as a result of 9901 million in prepayments in the third and fourth quarters of 2016 as well as the 5000 million prepayment in the second quarter of 2017 fiscal 2016 also includes the expensing of 266 million of amortizable noncash deferred financing costs and 26 million in fees associated with the refinancing of the new senior secured credit facilities on january 30 2018 we provided an irrevocable notice to the 2020 notes holders to call the 7500 million 2020 notes on march 1 2018 in connection with the early redemption of the 2020 notes we recorded a makewhole premium of 98 million which was payable on the call date of march 1 2018 

income taxes   our effective tax rate in 2017 was a benefit of 06 compared to expense of 326 in 2016 the decrease is due to the tcja that was signed into law on december 22 2017 which lowered the federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 and made numerous other law changes effective as of january 1 2018 our fiscal 2017 includes 34 days in calendar year 2018 therefore our overall 2017 statutory federal corporate tax rate is 337 the effective tax rate also includes a 5620 million benefit resulting from the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities to reflect the lower statutory federal rate of 21 the 2017 tax rate was also lower as a result of a reduction to the north carolina statutory tax rate which resulted in a decrease in the deferred tax liability related to the trade name intangible asset and a 99 million decrease in tax expense the 2017 rate also includes a reduction of approximately 56 million in the reserve for uncertain tax positions resulting from statute expirations and the reduction of interest accrued on method changes the tax rate in fiscal 2016 includes benefits resulting from a onetime election allowing the family dollar acquisition to be treated as an asset purchase for certain state tax purposes and a 10 decrease in north carolinas state tax rate which resulted in a reduction in the deferred tax liability related to the trade name intangible asset 

on december 22 2017 the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin 118 income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act “sab 118” which provides guidance on accounting for the impact of the tcja in effect allowing an entity to use a methodology similar to the measurement period in a business combination pursuant to the disclosure provisions of sab 118 as of february 3 2018 we have not completed our analysis of all of the effects of the tcja additionally future guidance from the internal revenue service irs sec or the financial accounting standards board fasb could result in changes to our accounting for the tax effects of the tcja while we are able to make a reasonable estimate of the impact of the reduction in the statutory federal corporate tax rate the rate may be affected by other analyses related to the tcja including but not limited to federal temporary differences resulting from accounting method changes or other adjustments for further discussion of the 

impact of the tcja refer to note 4  income taxes under the caption income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data beginning on page 43 of this form 10k 

we expect our effective tax rate to approximate 23 in fiscal 2018 subject to adjustments related to the sab 118 items noted above 

fiscal year ended january 28 2017  compared to fiscal year ended january 30 2016   

net sales   net sales increased 337 or 52208 million in 2016 compared to 2015 resulting from 44185 million of incremental net sales from family dollar due to 22 additional weeks of operations in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 sales in the dollar tree segments new stores and increased comparable store net sales partially offset by the loss of sales in the 325 stores which were divested on november 1 2015 in satisfaction of a federal trade commission requirement in connection with the family dollar acquisition comparable store net sales increased 18 on a constant currency basis including the impact of currency comparable store net sales also increased 18 due to an increase in average ticket as well as customer count comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores which we include in the calculation and are negatively affected when we open new stores rebanner stores or expand stores near existing stores 

gross profit  gross profit increased by 17380 million or 373 to 63947 million in 2016 compared to 46567 million in 2015 the dollar increase in gross profit was primarily driven by 14026 million of incremental gross profit for family dollar due to an additional 22 weeks of operations in 2016 compared to 2015 as well as higher sales for dollar tree partially offset by the loss of gross profit from the 325 stores which were divested on november 1 2015 gross profit margin increased to 308 in 2016 from 301 in 2015 as a result of the prior year including 730 million of markdown expense related to sku rationalization and planned liquidations and 702 million in amortization expense for family dollar related to the steppedup inventory which was sold during the 52 weeks ended january 30 2016 in addition the current year gross profit margin reflects lower merchandise cost due to higher initial markon and favorable freight costs our gross profit margin in the current year included an additional 22 weeks of family dollar’s operations which have a lowermargin product mix this negatively impacted the current year’s results in relation to the prior year’s results 

selling general and administrative expenses   selling general and administrative expenses for 2016 increased to 46899 million from 36070 million in 2015 an increase of 10829 million or 300 the increase was primarily due to an incremental 9723 million of expense for family dollar due to the 22 additional weeks of operations in 2016 compared to 2015 partially offset by lower selling general and administrative expenses resulting from the divestiture of 325 stores on november 1 2015 as a percentage of sales selling general and administrative expenses decreased to 226 in 2016 from 233 in 2015 in 2015 we incurred 391 million or 25 basis points of acquisition expenses excluding acquisition expenses the selling general and administrative rate for 2016 as a percentage of sales decreased 40 basis points to 226 from 230 as a result of lower payrollrelated costs and depreciation as a percentage of net sales and lower professional fees and legal fees partially offset by higher store repairs and maintenance as a percentage of net sales 

operating income   operating income for 2016 increased to 17048 million compared with 10497 million in 2015 operating income margin increased to 82 in 2016 from 68 in 2015 the increase in operating income is the result of an incremental 4303 million of operating income in the family dollar segment due to the additional 22 weeks of operations in 2016 compared to 2015 and a 2248 million increase in operating income in the dollar tree segment partially offset by the loss of operating income from the 325 stores which were divested on november 1 2015 in the prior year the family dollar segment incurred an operating loss of 308 million as a result of unusually high markdowns related to sku rationalization and planned liquidations and the amortization of steppedup inventory that was sold during the period 

interest expense net interest expense net was 3755 million in 2016 compared to 5994 million in 2015 the variance is due to the following 



 income taxes   our effective tax rate in 2016 was 326 compared to 370 in 2015 the decrease in the tax rate is primarily the result of a onetime election allowing the family dollar acquisition to be treated as an asset purchase for certain state tax purposes a 10 decrease in north carolinas state tax rate which resulted in a reduction in the deferred tax liability related to the trade name intangible asset and the adoption of asu no 201609 under which the incremental tax benefit recognized upon rsu vestings and stock option exercises is recorded in income tax expense

gross profit for family dollar increased 14026 million or 997 in 2016 compared to 2015 due to an additional 22 weeks of operations in 2016 compared to 2015 gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 266 in 2016 compared to 228 in 2015 the 380 basis point increase in gross profit margin was due to lower merchandise cost due to a decrease in inventory stepup amortization synergy efforts and lower markdowns gross profit margin was negatively impacted in 2015 due to 730 million of markdown expense related to sku rationalization and planned liquidations and 702 million in amortization expense related to steppedup inventory which was sold in 2015 

operating income for family dollar increased 4303 million or 13971 in 2016 compared to 2015 due to an additional 22 weeks of operations in 2016 compared to 2015 operating income as a percentage of sales increased primarily due to improved gross profit margin as noted above

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates certain of our estimates require a high level of judgment and have the potential to have a material effect on the financial statements if actual results vary significantly from those estimates following is a discussion of the estimates that we consider critical 

inventory valuation 

as discussed in note 1  summary of significant accounting policies under the caption merchandise inventories in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data beginning on page 43 of this form 10k inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weightedaverage basis cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weightedaverage basis under the retail inventory method the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated costtoretail ratio to the retail value of inventories the retail inventory method is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis 

inventory valuation methods require certain significant management estimates and judgments including estimates of future merchandise markdowns and shrink which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins the averaging required in applying the retail inventory method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns could under certain circumstances result in costs not being recorded in the proper period 

we estimate our markdown reserve based on the consideration of a variety of factors including but not limited to quantities of slow moving or seasonal carryover merchandise on hand historical markdown statistics and future merchandising plans the accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors some of which are outside of our control including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends historically we have not experienced significant differences in our estimated reserve for markdowns compared with actual results 

our accrual for shrink is based on the actual historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories adjusted if necessary for current economic conditions and business trends these estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger our physical inventory counts are generally taken between january and october of each year therefore the shrink accrual recorded at february 3 2018 is based on estimated shrink for most of 2017 including the fourth quarter we have not experienced significant fluctuations in historical shrink the amounts recorded in the current year reflect the dollar tree and family dollar segments’ historical results we periodically adjust our shrink estimates to reflect our best estimates based on the factors described 

our management believes that our application of the retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market each year on a consistent basis 

accrued expenses 

on a monthly basis we estimate certain expenses in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred certain expenses require a high degree of judgment and our most material estimates are for our selfinsurance accruals for workers’ compensation and general liability costs these accruals are recorded based on thirdparty actuarial valuations which we obtain at least annually these actuarial valuations are estimates based on our historical loss development factors and the related accruals are adjusted as management’s estimates change 

differences in managements estimates and assumptions could result in expenses which are materially different from the calculated accruals however historically the net total of these differences has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

indefinitelived intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair values these assets including goodwill are not amortized but are evaluated annually for impairment an additional evaluation is performed if events or circumstances indicate that impairment could have occurred such events or circumstances could include but are not limited to significant negative industry or economic trends unanticipated changes in the competitive environment and a significant sustained decline in the market price of our stock 

for purposes of our goodwill impairment evaluation the reporting units are family dollar dollar tree and dollar tree canada goodwill has been assigned to the reporting units based on prior business combinations related to the brands we estimate 

the fair value of our reporting units using projected future cash flows that are discounted using a weightedaverage cost of capital analysis that reflects current market conditions 

the family dollar goodwill and tradename comprise a substantial portion of our indefinitelived intangible assets and the management judgment utilized in the family dollar goodwill and tradename impairment evaluations is critical the computations require management to make estimates and assumptions and actual values may differ significantly from these judgments particularly if there are significant adverse changes in the operating environment critical assumptions that are used as part of the family dollar goodwill evaluation include 

 indefinitelived intangible assets such as the family dollar tradename are not subject to amortization but are reviewed at least annually for impairment the indefinitelived intangible asset impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible assets to their carrying values we estimate the fair value of tradename intangible assets based on an income approach using the relieffromroyalty method this approach is dependent upon a number of factors including estimates of future growth and trends royalty rates discount rates and other variables we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain the discount rate is consistent with the discount rate used in our family dollar goodwill impairment evaluation adjusted for revenuespecific growth risk 

our impairment evaluation of indefinitelived intangible assets did not result in impairment charges during fiscal 2017 2016 or 2015 the fair value of the family dollar reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value 

income taxes 

our income tax provision is estimated based on currently enacted tax rates and estimated state apportionment factors recent changes in tax law have been significant and the application of new laws requires management estimates and judgment see note 4  income taxes in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data beginning on page 43 of this form 10k for a detailed description of the impact of the tcja 

historically we have not experienced significant differences in our estimates of our tax accrual 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 1  summary of significant accounting policies in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data beginning on page 43 of this form 10k for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of our business including the impact of interest rate changes and diesel fuel cost changes we may enter into interest rate or diesel fuel swaps to manage exposure to interest rate and diesel fuel price changes we do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging and we do not hold derivative instruments for trading purposes 

interest rate risk 

at february 3 2018  we had 15 billion in borrowings subject to interest rate fluctuations representing approximately 27 of our total debt borrowings under the term loan a1 bear interest based on libor plus 150 to 225 determined based on our secured net leverage ratio as of february 3 2018  term loan a1 bore interest at libor plus 150 a 50 basis point increase in the variable interest rate tied to our secured net leverage ratio would result in an annual increase in interest expense of 77 million

on july 6 2015 we completed our purchase of family dollar stores inc and its more than 8200 stores this transformational transaction created the largest discount retailer by store count in north america the dollar tree and family dollar banners have complementary business models everything is 100 at dollar tree while family dollar is a neighborhood variety store offering merchandise largely for 10 or less also on october 13 2015 we announced our plans to convert all deals and dollar tree deals stores to one of our two primary banners dollar tree or family dollar on november 1 2015 we completed the transaction pursuant to which we divested 330 family dollar stores 325 of which were open at the time of the divestiture to dollar express llc a portfolio company of sycamore partners in order to satisfy a condition as required by the federal trade commission in connection with our purchase of family dollar 

we operate in two reporting business segments dollar tree and family dollar 

dollar tree 

our dollar tree segment is the leading operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise at the fixed price point of 100 the dollar tree segment includes 6360  stores operating under the dollar tree and dollar tree canada brands 11  distribution centers in the united states and two  in canada and a store support center in chesapeake virginia our stores range from predominantly 8000  10000 selling square feet in our dollar tree stores in the united states we sell all items for 100 or less and in our dollar tree canada stores we sell all items for 125cad or less our revenue and assets in canada are not material

all dollar tree stores in the united states accept cash checks debit cards and credit cards  we added freezers and coolers to certain stores and increased the amount of consumable merchandise carried by those stores we believe this initiative helps drive additional transactions and allows us to appeal to a broader demographic mix we added freezers and coolers to 500  additional stores in 2016  as of january 28 2017  we have freezers and coolers in approximately 4785  of our dollar tree stores we plan to install them in 400  additional stores by the end of fiscal 2017  along with the rollout of freezers and coolers we have increased the number of stores accepting electronic benefits transfer ebt cards and food stamps under the supplemental nutrition assistance program “snap” to approximately 6055  stores as of january 28 2017

we maintain a balanced selection of products within traditional variety store categories we offer a wide selection of everyday basic products and we supplement these basic everyday items with seasonal closeout and promotional merchandise we attempt to keep certain basic consumable merchandise in our stores continuously to establish our stores as a destination and increase traffic in our stores closeout and promotional merchandise is purchased opportunistically and represents less than 10  of our purchases 

the merchandise mix in our dollar tree stores consists of 

• consumable merchandise which includes candy and food health and beauty care and everyday consumables such as 

household paper and chemicals and in select stores frozen and refrigerated food

business strategy 

continue to execute our proven and best‑in‑class retail business strategy we will continue to execute our proven strategies that have generated a history of success and continued growth for the company key elements of our strategy include 

• continuously aiming to “wow” the customer with a compelling fun and fresh merchandise assortment comprising a 

variety of the things you want and things you need all at incredible values in bright clean and friendly stores 

• maintaining a flexible sourcing merchandise model that allows a variety of products to be sold as long as desired 

merchandise margin thresholds are met 

 • pursuing a “more better faster” approach to the rollout of new dollar tree and family dollar stores to broaden our 

geographic footprint 

 • maintaining a prudent approach with our use of capital for the benefit of our shareholders 

operate a diversified and complementary business model across both fixed‑price and multi‑price point strategies we plan to operate and grow both the dollar tree and family dollar banners we will utilize the reach and scale of our combined company to serve a broader range of customers in more ways offering better prices and more value for the customer dollar tree stores will continue to operate as single price point retail stores at dollar tree everything is 100 offering the customer a balanced mix of things they need and things they want our shopping experience will remain fun and friendly as we exceed our customers’ expectations for what they can buy for 100 dollar tree primarily serves middle income customers in suburban locations family dollar stores will continue to operate using multiple price points serving customers as their “neighborhood discount store” offering great values on everyday items and a convenient shopping experience family dollar primarily serves a lower income customer in urban and rural locations we will benefit from an expanded target customer profile and utilize the store concepts of both dollar tree and family dollar to serve a broader range of customer demographics to drive further improvements in sales and profitability 

deliver significant synergy opportunities through integration of family dollar our recent acquisition of family dollar will provide us with significant opportunities to achieve meaningful cost synergies we are executing a detailed integration plan and expect to achieve our target of approximately 300 million  of estimated run‑rate annual cost synergies by the end of july 2018 this synergy target does not account for onetime costs to achieve synergies investments back into the business integration costs or cost increases due to inflation vendor increases or other factors that are not caused by the business combination we expect to incur 300 million in onetime costs to achieve these target synergies expected sources of synergies include the following 



 take advantage of significant whitespace opportunity over the past decade we have built a solid and scalable infrastructure which provides a strong foundation for our future growth we are committed to growing our combined business to take advantage of significant white space opportunities that we believe exist for both the dollar tree and family dollar store concepts using our proven real estate strategy across our combined business we intend to drive future store openings by capitalizing on data‑driven insights regarding location target customer profile competitive dynamics and cost structure over the longterm we believe that the market can support more than 10000 dollar tree stores and 15000 family dollar stores across the united states 

convenient locations and store size we focus primarily on opening new dollar tree stores in strip shopping centers anchored by large retailers who draw target customers we believe to be similar to ours our stores are successful in metropolitan areas midsized cities and small towns we open new family dollar stores in strip shopping centers freestanding buildings and downtown buildings the range of our store sizes 8000  10000 selling square feet for dollar tree and 6000  8000 selling square feet for family dollar allows us to target a particular location with a store that best suits that market and takes advantage of available real estate opportunities our stores are attractively designed and create an inviting atmosphere for shoppers by using bright lighting vibrant colors and decorative signs we enhance the store design with attractive merchandise displays we believe this design attracts new and repeat customers and enhances our image as both a destination and impulse purchase store 

for more information on retail locations and retail store leases see item 2 properties beginning on page 19 of this form 10k 

profitable stores with strong cash flow we maintain a disciplined costsensitive approach to store site selection in order to minimize the initial capital investment required and maximize our potential to generate high operating margins and strong cash flows we believe that our stores have a relatively small shopping radius which allows us to profitably concentrate multiple stores within a single market our ability to open new stores is dependent upon among other factors locating suitable sites and negotiating favorable lease terms 

the strong cash flows generated by our stores allow us to selffund infrastructure investment and new stores over the past five years cash flows from operating activities have exceeded capital expenditures 

for more information on our results of operations see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations beginning on page 27 of this form 10k 

cost control  we believe that our substantial buying power and our flexibility in making sourcing decisions contributes to our successful purchasing strategy which includes targeted merchandise margin goals by category we also believe our ability to select quality merchandise helps to minimize markdowns we buy products on an orderbyorder basis and have no material longterm purchase contracts or other assurances of continued product supply or guaranteed product cost no vendor accounted for more than 10  of total merchandise purchased in any of the past five years 

our supply chain systems continue to provide us with valuable sales information to assist our buyers and improve merchandise allocation to our stores controlling our inventory levels has resulted in more efficient distribution and store operations 

information systems we believe that investments in technology help us to increase sales and control costs our inventory management system has allowed us to improve the efficiency of our supply chain enhance merchandise flow increase inventory turnover and control distribution and store operating costs it is also used to provide information to calculate our estimate of inventory cost under the retail inventory method which is widely used in the retail industry our automated replenishment system replenishes key items based on actual storelevel sales and inventory 

pointofsale data allows us to track sales and inventory by merchandise category at the store level and assists us in planning for future purchases of inventory we believe that this information allows us to ship the appropriate product to stores at the quantities commensurate with selling patterns using this pointofsale data to plan purchases has helped us manage our inventory levels 

corporate culture and values we believe that honesty and integrity and treating people fairly and with respect are core values within our corporate culture we believe that running a business and certainly a public company carries with it a responsibility to be above reproach when making operational and financial decisions our executive management team visits and shops at our stores like every customer and ideas and individual creativity on the part of our associates are encouraged particularly from our store managers who know their stores and their customers we have standards for store displays merchandise presentation and store operations we maintain an open door policy for all associates our distribution centers are operated based on objective measures of performance and virtually everyone in our store support centers is available to assist associates in our stores and distribution centers

growth strategy 

store openings and square footage growth the primary factors contributing to our net sales growth have been new store openings an active store expansion and remodel program and selective mergers and acquisitions in the last five years net sales increased at a compound annual growth rate of 294  including the addition of family dollar we expect that the majority of our future sales growth will come primarily from new store openings in our dollar tree and family dollar banners and from our store expansion and relocation program 

at february 2 2013  we operated 4671  stores in the united states and canada at january 28 2017  we operated 14108  stores in 48  states and the district of columbia as well as 226  stores in canada our selling square footage increased from approximately 405 million  square feet at february 2 2013  to 1124 million  square feet at january 28 2017  our store growth has resulted from opening new stores and our july 2015  acquisition of more than 8200  family dollar stores 

our growth and productivity statistics are reported based on selling square footage because our management believes the use of selling square footage yields a more accurate measure of store productivity we expect to increase the selling square footage in our stores in the future by opening new stores in underserved markets and strategically increasing our presence in our existing markets via new store openings and store expansions expansions include store relocations in fiscal 2017  and beyond we plan to predominantly open dollar tree stores that are approximately 8000   10000  selling square feet and family dollar stores that are approximately 6000   8000  selling square feet we believe these store sizes allow us to achieve our objectives in the markets in which we plan to expand 

in addition to new store openings we plan to continue our dollar tree store expansion program to increase our net sales per store and take advantage of market opportunities we target stores for expansion based on the current sales per selling square foot and changes in market opportunities stores targeted for expansion are generally less than 6000 selling square feet in size store expansions generally increase the existing store size by approximately 2750 selling square feet at january 28 2017  approximately 3467  of our dollar tree stores totaling 63  of our dollar tree banner selling square footage were 8000  selling square feet or larger  

since 1995  we have added a total of 695  stores through several mergers and acquisitions excluding our acquisition of family dollar historically our acquisition strategy has been to target companies that have a similar singleprice point concept that have shown success in operations or companies that provide a strategic advantage we evaluate potential acquisition opportunities as they become available on july 6 2015  we completed our acquisition of family dollar which allowed us to create a diversified company with complementary business models see note 2  acquisition in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” beginning on page 57 of this form 10k 

from time to time we also acquire the rights to store leases through bankruptcy or other proceedings we will continue to take advantage of these opportunities as they arise depending upon several factors including their fit within our location and selling square footage size parameters 

merchandising and distribution expanding our customer base is important to our growth plans we plan to continue to stock our stores with a compelling mix of everchanging merchandise that our customers have come to appreciate consumable merchandise typically leads to more frequent return trips to our stores resulting in increased sales the presentation and display of merchandise in our stores are critical to communicating value to our customers and creating a more exciting shopping experience we believe our approach to visual merchandising results in higher sales volume and an environment that encourages impulse purchases 

a strong and efficient distribution network is critical to our ability to grow and to maintain a lowcost operating structure in 2017 we will begin construction of a new dollar tree banner distribution center in 2016 we completed our cherokee county south carolina distribution center which is 15 million square feet and fully automated in addition we expanded our stockton california distribution center to 09 million square feet in 2014 we expanded our joliet illinois distribution center to 15 million square feet we believe our distribution center network is currently capable of supporting approximately 265 billion  in annual sales in the united states new distribution sites are strategically located to reduce stem miles maintain flexibility and improve 

efficiency in our store service areas we also are a party to an agreement which provides distribution services from two facilities in canada 

our dollar tree stores receive approximately 90  of their inventory from our distribution centers via contract carriers and our family dollar stores receive approximately 76  of their inventory from our distribution centers the remaining store inventory primarily perishable consumable items and other vendormaintained display items are delivered directly to our stores from vendors our family dollar stores receive approximately 15  of their merchandise from mclane company inc for more information on our distribution center network see item 2 properties beginning on page 19 of this form 10k 

competition 

our segment of the retail industry is highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future we operate in the discount retail business which is currently and is expected to continue to be highly competitive with respect to price store location merchandise quality assortment and presentation and customer service our competitors include singleprice dollar stores multiprice dollar stores mass merchandisers discount retailers drug stores convenience stores independentlyoperated discount stores and a wide variety of other retailers in addition several competitors have sections within their stores devoted to one dollar price point merchandise which further increases competition we believe we differentiate ourselves from other retailers by providing highvalue highquality lowcost merchandise in attractivelydesigned stores that are conveniently located our sales and profits could be reduced by increases in competition there are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector 

trademarks 

we are the owners of several federal service mark registrations including dollar tree the dollar tree logo and the dollar tree logo with a “1 in addition we own a registration for dollar bill we also acquired the rights to use trade names previously owned by everythings a dollar a former competitor in the 100 price point industry several trade names were included in the purchase including the mark everythings 100 we also own the logo mark for “everything’s 1” with the acquisition of deal we became the owner of the trademark deal” with the acquisition of dollar giant we became the owner of the trademark “dollar giant” and others in canada with the acquisition of family dollar we became the owners of the trademarks family dollar family dollar stores and other names and designs of certain merchandise sold in family dollar stores such as family gourmet family pet kidgets and outdoors by design we have federal trademark registrations for a number and variety of private labels that we use to market many of our product lines our trademark registrations have various expiration dates however assuming that the trademark registrations are properly maintained and renewed they have a perpetual duration 

employees 

we employed approximately 55300  fulltime and 121500  parttime associates on january 28 2017  parttime associates work an average of less than 30 hours per week the number of parttime associates fluctuates depending on seasonal needs we consider our relationship with our associates to be good and we have not experienced significant interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements 




 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk any failure to meet market expectations including our comparable store sales growth rate earnings and earnings per share or new store openings could cause the market price of our stock to decline you should carefully consider the specific risk factors listed below together with all other information included or incorporated in this report any of the following risks may materialize and additional risks not known to us or that we now deem immaterial may arise in such event our business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected 

our profitability is vulnerable to cost increases 

future increases in costs such as the cost of merchandise wage and benefit costs taxes duties merchandise loss due to theft damage or errors shipping rates freight costs fuel costs and store occupancy costs would reduce our profitability for example a proposal in congress called the borderadjustment tax would disallow the tax deduction for imported merchandise and interest in the last fiscal year our direct imports were 62673 million at retail and our interest expense was 3788 million even if the corporate tax rate were reduced this change would increase our federal income tax and reduce our profits substantially the minimum wage has increased in certain states and local jurisdictions and is scheduled to increase in other states and local jurisdictions there is a possibility that congress will increase the federal minimum wage the department of labor also issued regulations last year that would have resulted in fewer of our associates being exempt from overtime pay requirements which would have increased our wage costs but such rules are currently enjoined 

in our dollar tree segment we do not raise the sales price of our merchandise to offset cost increases because we are committed to selling primarily at the 100 price point to continue to provide value to the customer we are dependent on our ability to adjust our product assortment to operate more efficiently or to increase our comparable store net sales in order to offset inflation or other cost increases we can give no assurance that we will be able to operate more efficiently or increase our comparable store net sales in the future although family dollar unlike dollar tree can raise the price of merchandise customers would buy fewer products if prices were to increase please see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations beginning on page 27 of this form 10k for further discussion of the effect of inflation and other economic factors on our operations 

risks associated with our domestic and foreign suppliers including among others increased taxes duties tariffs or other restrictions on trade could adversely affect our financial performance 

we are dependent on our vendors to supply merchandise in a timely and efficient manner if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments due to financial or other difficulties we could experience merchandise shortages which could lead to lost sales or increased merchandise costs if alternative sources must be used 

we rely on the availability of imported goods at favorable wholesale prices merchandise imported directly accounts for approximately 41 to 43 of our dollar tree segments total retail value purchases and 15 to 17 of our family dollar segments total retail value purchases in addition we believe that a significant portion of our goods purchased from domestic vendors is imported china is the source of a substantial majority of our imports imported goods are generally less expensive than domestic goods and increase our profit margins a disruption in the flow of our imported merchandise an increase in the cost of those goods or an inability to deduct the cost of such goods for tax purposes may significantly decrease our profits risks associated with our reliance on imported goods may include disruptions in the flow of or increases in the cost of imported goods because of factors such as 

• an increase in duties tariffs or other restrictions on trade 

• the implementation of the borderadjustment tax 

• raw material shortages work stoppages strikes and political unrest 

• economic crises and international disputes or conflicts 

• changes in currency exchange rates or policies and local economic conditions including inflation in the country of 

  origin and 

• failure of the united states to maintain normal trade relations with china and other countries 

integrating family dollar’s operations with ours may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits synergies and cost savings of the acquisition may not be realized 

the success of the family dollar acquisition the “acquisition” including anticipated benefits synergies and cost savings will depend in part on our ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses and cultures of the family dollar segment into our company it is possible that the integration process will take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of key employees higher than expected costs including costs incurred with respect to the divested stores and related services ongoing diversion of management attention increased competition the disruption of our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers vendors and employees if we experience difficulties with the integration process the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected 

 in connection with the acquisition we were required to divest 330 stores and partially support those stores through a transition services agreement we are continuing to provide certain transition services to the buyer of the divested stores with respect to which the buyer may owe us approximately 40 million at any time under the transition services agreement the buyer must reimburse us for those services in the future we can give no assurances that we will be able to collect those amounts 

a downturn in economic conditions could impact our sales 

deterioration in economic conditions such as those caused by a recession inflation higher unemployment consumer debt levels trade disputes or international conflict as well as adverse weather conditions or terrorism could reduce consumer spending or cause customers to shift their spending to products we either do not sell or do not sell as profitably adverse economic conditions could disrupt consumer spending and significantly reduce our sales decrease our inventory turnover cause greater markdowns or reduce our profitability due to lower margins 

a significant disruption in our computer and technology systems could adversely affect our results of operation or business 

we rely extensively on our computer and technology systems to manage inventory process credit card and customer transactions and summarize results systems may be subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunication failures computer viruses security breaches and catastrophic events if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process customer transactions and may receive negative publicity which could adversely affect our results of operation or business 

if we are unable to secure our customers’ credit card and confidential information or other private data relating to our associates suppliers or our business we could be subject to negative publicity costly government enforcement actions or private litigation which could damage our business reputation and adversely affect our results of operation or business 

we have procedures and technology in place to safeguard our customers’ debit and credit card information our associates’ private data suppliers’ data and our business records and intellectual property despite these measures criminals are constantly devising schemes to circumvent safeguards and we may be vulnerable to and unable to detect and appropriately respond to data security breaches and data loss including cybersecurity attacks other sophisticated retailers have recently suffered serious security breaches if we experience a data security breach we could be exposed to negative publicity government enforcement actions private litigation or costly response measures in addition our reputation within the business community and with our customers may be affected which could result in our customers discontinuing the use of debit or credit cards in our stores or not shopping in our stores altogether this could have an adverse effect on our results of operation or business 

our growth is dependent on our ability to increase sales in existing stores and to expand our square footage profitably 

existing store sales growth is critical to good operating results and is dependent on a variety of factors including merchandise quality relevance and availability store operations and customer satisfaction in addition increased competition could adversely affect our sales our highest sales periods are during the christmas and easter seasons and we generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and our operating and net income during the fourth quarter in anticipation we stock extra inventory and hire many temporary employees to prepare our stores a reduction in sales during these periods could adversely affect our operating results particularly operating and net income to a greater extent than if a reduction occurred at other times of the year untimely merchandise delays due to receiving or distribution problems could have a similar effect when easter is observed earlier in the year the selling season is shorter and as a result our sales could be adversely affected easter was observed on april 5 2015 and march 27 2016 and will be observed on april 16 2017 

expanding our square footage profitably depends on a number of uncertainties including our ability to locate lease build out and open or expand stores in suitable locations on a timely basis under favorable economic terms obtaining an increasing 

number of profitable stores is an ever increasing challenge in addition our expansion is dependent upon thirdparty developers’ abilities to acquire land obtain financing and secure necessary permits and approvals it remains difficult for third party developers to obtain financing for new projects due to the recent turmoil in the financial markets we also open or expand stores within our established geographic markets where new or expanded stores may draw sales away from our existing stores we may not manage our expansion effectively and our failure to achieve our expansion plans could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we could encounter disruptions in our distribution network or additional costs in distributing merchandise 

our success is dependent on our ability to transport merchandise to our distribution centers and then ship it to our stores in a timely and costeffective manner we also rely on third parties to deliver certain merchandise directly from vendors to our stores we may not anticipate respond to or control all of the challenges of operating our receiving and distribution systems additionally if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments we could experience merchandise shortages that could lead to lost sales or increased costs some of the factors that could have an adverse effect on our distribution network or costs are 

• shipping disruption our oceanic shipping schedules may be disrupted or delayed from time to time 

 • efficient operations distribution centers and other aspects of our distribution network are difficult to operate 

efficiently and we could experience a reduction in operating efficiency 

• diesel fuel costs we have experienced volatility in diesel fuel costs over the past few years 

• vulnerability to natural or manmade disasters a fire explosion or natural disaster at a port or any of our distribution 

facilities could result in a loss of merchandise and impair our ability to adequately stock our stores some facilities are 

  vulnerable to earthquakes hurricanes or tornadoes 

• labor disagreement labor disagreements disruptions or strikes may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise 

to our distribution centers or stores and increase costs 

• war terrorism and other events war and acts of terrorism in the united states the middle east or in china or other 

parts of asia where we buy a significant amount of our imported merchandise could disrupt our supply chain or 

increase our transportation costs 

• economic conditions suppliers may encounter financial or other difficulties 

our profitability is affected by the mix of products we sell 

our gross profit margin could decrease if we increase the proportion of higher cost goods we sell in the future imported merchandise is generally lower cost than domestic goods if the proposed borderadjustment tax or a possible increase in duties increases the cost of imported goods we may sell less imported goods and our profitability may suffer in recent years the percentage of our sales from higher cost consumable products has increased and we can give no assurance that this trend will not continue as a result our gross profit margin could decrease unless we are able to maintain our current merchandise cost sufficiently to offset any decrease in our product margin percentage we can give no assurance that we will be able to do so 

in our family dollar segment our success also depends on our ability to select and obtain sufficient quantities of relevant merchandise at prices that allow us to sell such merchandise at profitable and appropriate prices a sales price that is too high causes products to be less attractive to our customers and our sales at family dollar could suffer we are continuing to implement our everyday low price strategy at family dollar to drive customer loyalty and have a strategic pricing team to improve our value and to increase profitability inability to successfully implement our pricing strategies at family dollar could have a negative effect on our business 

in addition our family dollar segment has a substantial number of private brand items and the number of items has been increasing we believe our success in maintaining broad market acceptance of our private brands depends on many factors including our pricing costs quality and customer perception we may not achieve or maintain our expected sales for our private brands and as a result our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted additionally the increased number of private brands could negatively impact our existing relationships with our nonprivate brand suppliers 

pressure from competitors may reduce our sales and profits 

the retail industry is highly competitive the marketplace is highly fragmented as many different retailers compete for market share by utilizing a variety of store formats and merchandising strategies we expect competition to increase in the future there are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector some of our current or potential competitors have greater financial resources than we do we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors please see item 1 business beginning on page 6 of this form 10k for further discussion of the effect of competition on our operations 

litigation may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to the risk of litigation involving employees consumers suppliers competitors shareholders government agencies or others through private actions class actions governmental investigations administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation our products could also cause illness or injury harm our reputation and subject us to litigation for example we are currently defendants in national and state employmentrelated class and collective actions and litigation concerning injury from products the outcome of litigation is difficult to assess or quantify plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits or proceedings may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss may remain unknown for substantial periods of time in addition certain of these matters if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in an expense that may be material to our financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operation are required the cost to defend current and future litigation or proceedings may be significant there also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation including litigation related to product or food safety customer information and environmental or safety requirements which could negatively affect customer perception of our business regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable 

for a discussion of current legal matters please see item 3 legal proceedings beginning on page 22 of this form 10k and note 5  commitments and contingencies under the caption contingencies in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data beginning on page 64 of this form 10k resolution of these matters if decided against the company could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations accrued liabilities or cash flows 

changes in federal state or local law or our failure to comply with such laws could increase our expenses and expose us to legal risks 

our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations for example the proposed borderadjustment tax would increase our federal income tax and reduce our profits substantially also the department of labor enacted changes to overtime regulations that were scheduled to take effect on december 1 2016 and would have required store managers and certain other associates to be paid no less than a specified salary in order to be exempt from the overtime requirements on november 22 2016 a federal court judge in texas issued a preliminary injunction that temporarily blocks the department of labor from implementing and enforcing these regulations on a national basis although it is unclear what longterm impact this injunction will have we may be negatively impacted if any surviving regulations result in fewer of our associates being exempt from overtime pay requirements the minimum wage has increased or is scheduled to increase in multiple states and local jurisdictions and there is a possibility that congress will increase the federal minimum wage significant legislative changes in regulations such as the healthcare legislation that impact our relationship with our workforce could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations changes in other regulatory areas such as consumer credit privacy and information security product and food safety worker safety or environmental protection among others could cause our expenses to increase or product recalls in addition if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations particularly wage and hour laws we could be subject to legal risk including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation which could adversely affect our results of operations changes in tax laws the interpretation of existing laws or our failure to sustain our reporting positions on examination could adversely affect our effective tax rate 

our business could be adversely affected if we fail to attract and retain qualified associates and key personnel 

our growth and performance is dependent on the skills experience and contributions of our associates executives and key personnel various factors including our recent merger overall labor availability wage rates regulatory or legislative impacts and benefit costs could impact our ability to attract and retain qualified associates at our stores distribution centers and corporate offices 

certain provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws could delay or discourage a change of control transaction that may be in a shareholder’s best interest 

our articles of incorporation and bylaws currently contain provisions that may delay or discourage a takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider in his best interest these provisions among other things 

• provide that only the board of directors chairman or president may call special meetings of the shareholders 

• establish certain advance notice procedures for nominations of candidates for election as directors and for shareholder 

proposals to be considered at shareholders’ meetings and 

• permit the board of directors without further action of the shareholders to issue and fix the terms of preferred stock 

which may have rights senior to those of the common stock 

however we believe that these provisions allow our board of directors to negotiate a higher price in the event of a takeover attempt which would be in the best interest of our shareholders 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition limit our ability to obtain additional financing restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures 

in connection with the acquisition we substantially increased our indebtedness which could adversely affect our ability to fulfill our obligations and have a negative impact on our financing options and liquidity position as of january 28 2017  our total indebtedness is 63918 million in addition we have 12500 million  of additional borrowing availability under our tranche a revolving credit facility less amounts outstanding for letters of credit totaling 1607 million 

our high level of debt could have significant consequences including the following 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or 

other general corporate purposes 

• requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes 

thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 

• limiting our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all 

• imposing restrictive covenants on our operations 

• placing us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors carrying less debt and 

• making us more vulnerable to economic downturns and limiting our ability to withstand competitive pressures 

in addition our credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and accordingly our cost of capital our ratings reflect the opinions of the ratings agencies of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations there can be no assurance that we will achieve a particular rating or maintain a particular rating in the future 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to fund our daytoday operations or to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations and other cash requirements we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to sell assets or operations seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to effect any such alternative measures if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful such alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations the agreements that govern our indebtedness restrict a our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from any such dispositions and b our ability to raise debt capital to be used to repay our indebtedness when it becomes due we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our obligations 

if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default and as a result holders of the notes and lenders under any of our existing and future indebtedness could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable the lenders under the credit facilities could terminate their commitments to loan money our secured lenders could foreclose against the assets securing such borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation in each case which could result in your losing your investment 

the terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness may restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to pursue our business strategies and could adversely affect our capital resources financial condition and liquidity 

the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interests including among other things restrictions on our ability to 

• incur assume or guarantee additional indebtedness 

• declare or pay dividends or make other distributions with respect to or purchase or otherwise acquire or retire for 

value equity interests 

• make principal payments on or redeem or repurchase subordinated debt 

• make loans advances or other investments 

• incur liens 

• sell or otherwise dispose of assets including capital stock of subsidiaries 

• enter into sale and leaseback transactions 

• consolidate or merge with or into or sell all or substantially all of our assets to another person and 

• enter into transactions with affiliates 

in addition certain of these agreements require us to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants our ability to satisfy these financial maintenance covenants can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot assure you that we will meet them 

a breach of the covenants under these agreements could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness which if not cured or waived could result in us having to repay our borrowings before their due dates such default may allow the debt holders to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies if we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or if we were to experience difficulty in refinancing the debt prior to maturity our results of operations or financial condition could be materially affected in addition an event of default under our credit facilities may permit the lenders under our credit facilities to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under such credit facilities furthermore if we are unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our credit facilities those lenders may be able to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness in the event our lenders or holders of notes accelerate the repayment of such borrowings we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay such indebtedness 

as a result of these restrictions we may be 

• limited in how we conduct our business 

• unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns or 

• unable to compete effectively take advantage of new business opportunities or grow in accordance with our plans 

our variablerate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our annual debt service obligations to increase significantly 

certain of our indebtedness including borrowings under our tranche a revolving credit facility is subject to variable rates of interest and exposes us to interest rate risk interest rates while historically low have recently begun to increase when interest rates increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same and our net income decreases an increase decrease of 10 on the interest rate would result in an increase decrease of 218 million in annual interest expense although we may enter into interest rate swaps involving the exchange of floating for fixedrate interest payments to reduce interest rate volatility we cannot assure you we will be able to do so

stores 

as of january 28 2017  we operated 14334  stores in 48  states and the district of columbia and five  canadian provinces as detailed below 





we lease the vast majority of our stores and expect to lease the majority of our new stores as we expand our leases typically provide for a short initial lease term generally five  years with options to extend however in some cases we have initial lease terms of seven  to fifteen  years we believe this leasing strategy enhances our flexibility to pursue various expansion opportunities resulting from changing market conditions as current leases expire we believe that we will be able to obtain lease renewals if desired for present store locations or to obtain leases for equivalent or better locations in the same general area

key events and recent developments

and 7500 million in aggregate principal amount of term loan b3 in addition we used 2420 million of cash on hand to prepay the remainder of the term loan b1 

 overview 

we are a leading operator of more than 14300  discount retail stores and we conduct our operations in two reporting segments our dollar tree segment is the leading operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise at the fixed price of 100 our family dollar segment operates general merchandise retail discount stores providing consumers with a selection of competitivelypriced merchandise in convenient neighborhood stores 

our net sales are derived from the sale of merchandise two major factors tend to affect our net sales trends first is our success at opening new stores or adding new stores through mergers or acquisitions second is the performance of stores once they are open sales vary at our existing stores from one year to the next we refer to this change as a change in comparable store net sales because we include only those stores that are open throughout both of the periods being compared beginning after the first fifteen months of operation we include sales from stores expanded during the year in the calculation of comparable store net sales which has the effect of increasing our comparable store net sales the term expanded also includes stores that are relocated our acquired family dollar stores are included in the comparable store net sales calculation beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 however they will not be included in the annual comparable store net sales calculation until fiscal 2017 stores that have been rebannered are considered to be new stores and are not included in the calculation of the comparable store net sales change until after the first fifteen months of operation under the new banner 

at january 28 2017  we operated stores in 48 states and the district of columbia as well as stores in five canadian provinces a breakdown of store counts and square footage by segment for the years ended january 28 2017  and january 30 2016  respectively are as follows family dollars beginning amounts for the year ended january 30 2016 are as of the july 6 2015  acquisition date 



stores are included as rebanners when they close or open respectively comparable store net sales for dollar tree may be negatively affected when a family dollar store is rebannered near an existing dollar tree store 

the average size of stores opened in 2016  was approximately 8100  selling square feet or about 10100  gross square feet for the dollar tree segment and 7100  selling square feet or about 8300  gross square feet for the family dollar segment for 2017  we continue to plan to open stores that are approximately 8000   10000  selling square feet or about 10000   12000  gross square feet for the dollar tree segment and approximately 6000   8000  selling square feet or about 7000   9000  gross square feet for the family dollar segment we believe that these size stores are our optimal sizes operationally and give our customers a shopping environment which invites them to shop longer buy more and make return visits which increases our customer traffic 

fiscal 2016  fiscal 2015  and fiscal 2014  which ended on january 28 2017  january 30 2016  and january 31 2015  respectively each included 52 weeks 

in fiscal 2016  comparable store net sales increased by 18  the comparable store net sales increase was the result of a 07  increase in the number of transactions and a 11  increase in average ticket we believe comparable store net sales continued to be positively affected by a number of our dollar tree initiatives as debit and credit card penetration continued to increase in 2016  and we continued the rollout of frozen and refrigerated merchandise to more of our dollar tree stores at january 28 2017  the dollar tree segment had frozen and refrigerated merchandise in approximately 4785  stores which includes rebannered stores compared to approximately 4285  stores at january 30 2016  we believe that the addition of frozen and refrigerated product enables us to increase sales and earnings by increasing the number of shopping trips made by our customers in addition the dollar tree segment accepts food stamps under the supplemental nutrition assistance program “snap” in approximately 6055  qualified stores compared to approximately 5600  stores at the end of 2015  

our pointofsale technology provides us with valuable sales and inventory information to assist our buyers and improve our merchandise allocation to our stores we believe that this has enabled us to better manage our inventory flow in our stores resulting in more efficient distribution and store operations 

we previously announced that we would rebanner our deals stores in 2015 and 2016 the majority of the deals stores were rebannered as dollar tree stores and the remaining stores were rebannered as family dollar stores in 2016 and 2015 167 and 52 stores were rebannered and we recorded 155 million in expenses in connection with the rebannering in fiscal 2015 

the department of labor under the fair labor standards act enacted changes to overtime regulations that were scheduled to take effect on december 1 2016 the changes require store managers and certain other associates to be paid no less than a specified salary in order to be exempt from the overtime requirements on november 22 2016 a federal court judge in texas issued a preliminary injunction that temporarily blocks the department of labor from implementing and enforcing these regulations on a national basis as a result of the preliminary injunction we postponed our response to these regulations it is unclear what longterm impact this injunction will have on overtime regulations once this matter is resolved we will analyze our alternatives to address the overtime regulations under the fair labor standards act 

we must continue to control our merchandise costs inventory levels and our general and administrative expenses as increases in these items could negatively impact our operating results 

acquisition and divestiture 

on july 27 2014 we executed an agreement and plan of merger to acquire family dollar in a cash and stock transaction on july 6 2015 we completed the acquisition and family dollar became a direct whollyowned subsidiary under the acquisition the family dollar shareholders received 5960 in cash and 02484 shares of our common stock for each share of family dollar common stock they owned plus cash in lieu of fractional shares the merger consideration 

as of the acquisition date each outstanding performance share right of family dollar common stock was canceled in exchange for the right of the holder to receive the merger consideration the psr payment the aggregate amount we paid for the merger consideration and psr payment was 68 billion in cash and we issued 285 million shares of our common stock valued at 23 billion based on the closing price of our common stock on july 2 2015 

for a complete description of the acquisition refer to our current report on form 8k filed with the sec on july 8 2015 

we incurred 392 million and 285 million in acquisitionrelated expenses in 2015 and 2014 respectively excluding acquisitionrelated interest expense we also expended approximately 1657 million in capitalizable debtissuance costs related to the financing of the acquisition and 788 million and 1298 million of debtissuance costs was included as a reduction in longterm debt net excluding current portion at january 28 2017 and january 30 2016 respectively 

we expect to achieve approximately 300 million in annual cost savings synergies by the end of the third year after closing and we will incur 300 million in onetime costs to achieve these synergies 

in 2015 we completed the offering of 325 billion of senior notes and entered into a credit facility and term loan providing for 62 billion in senior secured credit facilities see liquidity and capital resources for a further discussion of these transactions 

in connection with the acquisition we divested 330 family dollar stores to settle federal trade commission charges that the acquisition would be anticompetitive in certain local markets the 330 family dollar stores 325 of which were open at the time of the divestiture represent approximately 455 million of annual operating income in accordance with purchase accounting the net effect of the divestiture on our assets and liabilities is fully reflected in the table summarizing the estimates of fair value set forth in note 2  acquisition and the consolidated balance sheet of dollar tree inc as of january 30 2016 included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k we are continuing to provide certain transition services to the buyer with respect to which the buyer may owe us approximately 40 million at any time under the transition services agreement the buyer must reimburse us for those services in the future 

results of operations 



fiscal year ended january 28 2017  compared to fiscal year ended january 30 2016   

net sales   net sales increased 337 or 52208 million in 2016 compared to 2015 resulting from 44185 million of incremental net sales from family dollar due to 22 additional weeks of operations in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 sales in the dollar tree segments new stores and increased comparable store sales partially offset by the loss of sales in the 325 stores which were divested on november 1 2015 in satisfaction of a federal trade commission requirement in connection with the family dollar acquisition comparable store sales increased 18 on a constant currency basis constant currency basis refers to the calculation excluding the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations we calculated the constant currency basis increase by translating the current years comparable store sales in canada using the prior years currency exchange rates we believe that the constant currency basis provides a more accurate measure of comparable store sales performance including the impact of currency comparable store net sales also increased 18 due to an increase in average ticket as well as customer count comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores which we include in the calculation and are negatively affected when we open new stores rebanner stores or expand stores near existing stores 

gross profit  gross profit increased by 17380 million or 373 to 63947 million in 2016 compared to 46567 million in 2015 the dollar increase in gross profit was primarily driven by 14026 million of incremental gross profit for family dollar due to an additional 22 weeks of operations in 2016 compared to 2015 as well as higher sales for dollar tree partially offset by the loss of gross profit from the 325 stores which were divested on november 1 2015 gross profit margin increased to 308 in 2016 from 301 in 2015 as a result of the prior year including 730 million of markdown expense related to sku rationalization and planned liquidations and 702 million in amortization expense for family dollar related to the steppedup inventory which was sold during the 52 weeks ended january 30 2016 in addition the current year gross profit margin reflects lower merchandise cost due to higher initial markon and favorable freight costs our gross profit margin in the current year included an additional 22 weeks of family dollar’s operations which have a lowermargin product mix this negatively impacted the current year’s results in relation to the prior year’s results 

selling general and administrative expenses   selling general and administrative expenses for 2016 increased to 46899 million from 36070 million in 2015 an increase of 10829 million or 300 the increase was primarily due to an incremental 9723 million of expense for family dollar due to the 22 additional weeks of operations in 2016 compared to 2015 partially offset by lower selling general and administrative expenses resulting from the divestiture of 325 stores on november 1 2015 as 

a percentage of sales selling general and administrative expenses decreased to 226 in 2016 from 233 in 2015 in 2015 we incurred 391 million or 25 basis points of acquisition expenses excluding acquisition expenses the selling general and administrative rate for 2016 as a percentage of sales decreased 40 basis points to 226 from 230 as a result of lower payrollrelated costs and depreciation as a percentage of net sales and lower professional fees and legal fees partially offset by higher store repairs and maintenance as a percentage of net sales 

operating income   operating income for 2016 increased to 17048 million compared with 10497 million in 2015 operating income margin increased to 82 in 2016 from 68 in 2015 the increase in operating income is the result of an incremental 4303 million of operating income in the family dollar segment due to the additional 22 weeks of operations in 2016 compared to 2015 and a 2248 million increase in operating income in the dollar tree segment partially offset by the loss of operating income from the 325 stores which were divested on november 1 2015 in the prior year the family dollar segment incurred an operating loss of 308 million as a result of unusually high markdowns related to sku rationalization and planned liquidations and the amortization of steppedup inventory that was sold during the period 

interest expense net interest expense net was 3755 million in 2016 compared to 5994 million in 2015 the variance is due to the following 

 income taxes   our effective tax rate in 2016 was 326 compared to 370 in 2015 the decrease in the tax rate is primarily the result of a onetime election allowing the family dollar acquisition to be treated as an asset purchase for certain state tax purposes a 10 decrease in north carolinas state tax rate which resulted in a reduction in the deferred tax liability related to the trade name intangible asset and the adoption of asu no 201609 under which the incremental tax benefit recognized upon rsu vestings and stock option exercises is recorded in income tax expense 

fiscal year ended january 30 2016  compared to fiscal year ended january 31 2015   

net sales   net sales increased 802 or 68962 million in 2015 compared to 2014 resulting from 61620 million of net sales from family dollar since the acquisition date sales in the dollar tree segments new stores and increased comparable store net sales comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores which we include in the calculation and to a lesser extent are negatively affected when we open new stores rebanner stores or expand stores near existing ones 

gross profit   gross profit increased by 16227 million or 535 to 46567 million in 2015 compared to 30340 million in 2014 the dollar increase in gross profit was primarily driven by 14074 million of gross profit for family dollar as well as higher sales for dollar tree our gross profit margin is negatively impacted by the overall lowermargin product mix for the family dollar segment included in family dollars cost of sales is 730 million of markdown expense related to sku rationalization and planned liquidations and 702 million for amortization of the steppedup inventory value for inventory which was sold during 2015 

selling general and administrative expenses   selling general and administrative expenses for 2015 increased to 36070 million from 19938 million in 2014 an increase of 16132 million or 809 the increase was primarily due to 14382 million of expense for family dollar as a percentage of net sales selling general and administrative expenses increased to 233 for 2015 compared to 232 for 2014 in 2015 we incurred 391 million or 25 basis points of expenses related to the acquisition compared to 285 million or 35 basis points in 2014 excluding acquisition expenses the selling general and administrative rate increased to 230 in 2015 compared to 228 in 2014 the increase is primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization as 

a percentage of net sales resulting from the recording of favorable lease rights and fixed assets at their fair values in connection with the acquisition 

operating income   operating income for 2015 increased to 10497 million compared with 10402 million in 2014 an increase of 95 million or 09 operating income margin decreased from 121 in 2014 to 68 in 2015 the increase in operating income was due to a 403 million increase in the dollar tree segment partially offset by a 308 million operating loss in the family dollar segment the decrease in operating income margin is a result of the family dollar segment operating loss due to unusually high markdowns related to sku rationalization and planned liquidations and the amortization of steppedup inventory sold in 2015 as well as higher depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net sales resulting from the recording of favorable lease rights and fixed assets at their fair values in connection with the acquisition 

interest expense net   interest expense net was 5994 million in 2015 compared to 801 million in 2014 due to the following 

 income taxes   our effective tax rate was 370 in 2015 compared to 372 in 2014 the rate decrease is due to the utilization of a capital loss to offset the previously recognized gain on our investment in ollies holdings inc and additional work opportunity tax credits partially offset by an increase in the valuation allowance

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates certain of our estimates require a high level of judgment and have the potential to have a material effect on the financial statements if actual results vary significantly from those estimates following is a discussion of the estimates that we consider critical 

inventory valuation 

as discussed in note 1  summary of significant accounting policies under the caption merchandise inventories in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data beginning on page 52 of this form 10k inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weightedaverage basis cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weightedaverage basis under the retail inventory method the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated costtoretail ratio to the retail value of inventories the retail inventory method is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis 

inventory valuation methods require certain significant management estimates and judgments including estimates of future merchandise markdowns and shrink which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins the averaging required in applying the retail inventory method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns could under certain circumstances result in costs not being recorded in the proper period 

we estimate our markdown reserve based on the consideration of a variety of factors including but not limited to quantities of slow moving or seasonal carryover merchandise on hand historical markdown statistics and future merchandising plans the accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors some of which are outside of our control including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends historically we have not experienced significant differences in our estimated reserve for markdowns compared with actual results 

our accrual for shrink is based on the actual historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories adjusted if necessary for current economic conditions and business trends these estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger our physical inventory counts are generally taken between january and october of each year therefore the shrink accrual recorded at january 28 2017 is based on estimated shrink for most of 2016 including the fourth quarter we have not experienced significant fluctuations in historical shrink rates beyond approximately 1020 basis points in our dollar tree segment for the last few years the amounts recorded in the current year reflect the dollar tree and family dollar segments’ historical results we periodically adjust our shrink estimates to reflect our best estimates based on the factors described 

our management believes that our application of the retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market each year on a consistent basis 

in our family dollar segment we receive vendor support in the form of cash payments or allowances through a variety of reimbursements such as purchase discounts and allowances cooperative advertising scan downs and volume or other rebates we have agreements with vendors setting forth the specific conditions for each allowance or payment in accordance with asc 60550 revenue recognition  customer payments and incentives depending on the arrangement we either recognize the allowance as a reduction of current costs or recognize the benefit over the period the related merchandise is sold if the payment is a reimbursement for costs incurred it is offset against those related costs otherwise it is treated as a reduction to cost of goods sold 

accrued expenses 

on a monthly basis we estimate certain expenses in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred certain expenses such as legal reserves require a high degree of judgment and our most material estimates include domestic freight expenses selfinsurance costs storelevel operating expenses such as property taxes and utilities and certain other expenses 

we are involved in numerous legal proceedings and claims our accruals if any related to these proceedings and claims are based on a determination of whether or not the loss is both probable and estimable we review outstanding matters with external counsel to assess the probability of an unfavorable outcome and estimates of loss we reevaluate outstanding proceedings and claims each quarter or as new and significant information becomes available and we adjust or establish accruals if necessary our legal proceedings are described in note 5  commitments and contingencies under the caption contingencies in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data beginning on page 64 of this form 10k 

our freight and storelevel operating expenses are estimated based on current activity and historical trends and results our workers compensation general liability and health insurance accruals are recorded based on thirdparty actuarial valuations which 

we obtain at least annually for our workers compensation and general liability accruals these actuarial valuations are estimates based on our historical loss development factors for our health insurance accrual the actuary provides an estimate based on historical claims and claim payment timing certain other expenses are estimated and recorded in the periods that management becomes aware of them the related accruals are adjusted as management’s estimates change 

differences in managements estimates and assumptions could result in expenses which are materially different from the calculated accruals our experience has been that some of our estimates are too high and others are too low historically the net total of these differences has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

business combinationspurchase price allocation 

for the family dollar acquisition we allocated the purchase price to the various tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values which were finalized during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities is subjective in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions which are inherently uncertain we engaged third party experts to assist in the determination of fair value for certain complex assets acquired and liabilities assumed many of the estimates and assumptions used to determine fair values such as those used for intangible assets are made based on forecasted information and discount rates in addition the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as asset lives can materially impact our results of operations 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

indefinitelived intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair values these assets including goodwill are not amortized but are evaluated annually for impairment an additional evaluation is performed if events or circumstances indicate that impairment could have occurred such events or circumstances could include but are not limited to significant negative industry or economic trends unanticipated changes in the competitive environment and a significant sustained decline in the market price of our stock 

for purposes of our goodwill impairment evaluation the reporting units are family dollar dollar tree and dollar tree canada goodwill has been assigned to the reporting units based on prior business combinations related to the brands we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using projected future cash flows that are discounted using a weightedaverage cost of capital analysis that reflects current market conditions management judgment is a significant factor in the goodwill impairment evaluation process the computations require management to make estimates and assumptions actual values may differ significantly from these judgments particularly if there are significant adverse changes in the operating environments for our reporting units critical assumptions that are used as part of these evaluations include 

 indefinitelived intangible assets such as the family dollar tradename are not subject to amortization but are reviewed at least annually for impairment the indefinitelived intangible asset impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible assets to their carrying values we estimate the fair value of tradename intangible assets based on an income approach using the relieffromroyalty method this approach is dependent upon a number of factors including estimates of future growth and trends royalty rates discount rates and other variables we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain the discount rate is consistent with the discount rate used in our family dollar goodwill impairment evaluation adjusted for revenuespecific growth risk 

our impairment evaluation of indefinitelived intangible assets did not result in impairment charges during fiscal 2016 2015 or 2014 

income taxes 

on a quarterly basis we estimate our required income tax liability and assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets our income taxes payable are estimated based on currently enacted tax rates and estimated state apportionment factors management assesses the recoverability of deferred tax assets based on the availability of carrybacks of future deductible amounts and management’s projections for future taxable income we cannot guarantee that we will generate taxable income in future years historically we have not experienced significant differences in our estimates of our tax accrual 

in addition we have a recorded liability for our estimate of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns judgment is required in evaluating the application of federal and state tax laws including relevant case law and assessing whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination and if so judgment is also required as to the measurement of the amount of tax benefit that will be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or the final outcome differs from the amounts recorded we believe that our liability for uncertain tax positions is adequate for further discussion of our changes in reserves during fiscal 2016 see note 4  income taxes in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data beginning on page 61 of this form 10k 

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations 

we experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales comparable store net sales operating income and net income and expect this trend to continue our results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors including 

 our highest sales periods are the christmas and easter seasons easter was observed on april 5 2015  and on march 27 2016  and will be observed on april 16 2017  we believe that the later easter in 2017 could result in a 100 million  increase in sales in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the first quarter of 2016 we generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and of our operating and net income during the fourth quarter in anticipation of increased sales activity during these months we purchase substantial amounts of inventory and hire a significant number of temporary employees to supplement our continuing store staff our operating results particularly operating and net income could suffer if our net sales were below seasonal norms during the fourth quarter or during the easter season for any reason including merchandise delivery delays due to receiving or distribution problems changes in consumer sentiment or inclement weather 

our unaudited results of operations for the eight most recent quarters are shown in a table in note 12  quarterly financial information unaudited in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data beginning on page 88 of this form 10k 

inflation and other economic factors 

our ability to provide quality merchandise at a fixed price in our dollar tree stores and on a profitable basis may be subject to economic factors and influences that we cannot control consumer spending could decline because of economic pressures including unemployment and rising fuel prices reductions in consumer confidence and spending could have an adverse effect on our sales national or international events including war or terrorism could lead to disruptions in economies in the united states or in foreign countries these and other factors could increase our merchandise costs fuel costs and other costs that are critical to our operations such as shipping and wage rates 

shipping costs  transpacific shipping rates are negotiated with individual freight lines and are subject to fluctuation based on shipping industry market conditions and fuel costs  we can give no assurances as to the final rate trends for 2017 as we are in the early stages of our negotiations 

wage costs multiple states and local jurisdictions passed legislation that increased their minimum wages in 2016 and 2017 and the federal government has made indications that it may consider increasing the federal minimum wage as a result we believe our expenses will increase except to the extent that we are able to offset our payroll costs with savings in our operations 

the department of labor under the fair labor standards act enacted changes to overtime regulations that were scheduled to take effect on december 1 2016 the changes require store managers and certain other associates to be paid no less than a 

specified salary in order to be exempt from the overtime requirements on november 22 2016 a federal court judge in texas issued a preliminary injunction that temporarily blocks the department of labor from implementing and enforcing these regulations on a national basis as a result of the preliminary injunction we postponed our response it is unclear what longterm impact this injunction will have on overtime regulations once this matter is resolved we will analyze our alternatives to address the overtime regulations under the fair labor standards act 

imports  based on possible future legislation tariffs on imported goods may increase and under the borderadjustment tax proposal we may be unable to deduct the cost of imported goods last year we paid approximately 937 million in tariffs and imported approximately 274 of our merchandise 

currency fluctuations we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our operations in canada

interest rate risk

we operate in two  reporting business segments dollar tree and family dollar 

dollar tree 

our dollar tree segment is the leading operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise at the fixed price point of 100  the dollar tree segment includes 5954  stores operating under the dollar tree dollar tree canada deals and dollar tree deals brands ten  distribution centers in the united states and two  in canada and a store support center in chesapeake virginia our stores range from predominantly 8000  10000 selling square feet in the dollar tree stores in the united states we sell all items for 100  or less and in the dollar tree canada stores we sell all items for 125 cad or less in our remaining stores operating as deals or dollar tree deals we sell items for 100  or less but also sell items for more than 100  our revenue and assets in canada are not material

we maintain a balanced selection of products within traditional variety store categories we offer a wide selection of everyday basic products and we supplement these basic everyday items with seasonal closeout and promotional merchandise we attempt to keep certain basic consumable merchandise in our stores continuously to establish our stores as a destination and increase the traffic in our stores closeout and promotional merchandise is purchased opportunistically and represents less than 10  of our purchases

household paper and chemicals and in select stores frozen and refrigerated food

deliver significant synergy opportunities through integration of family dollar our recent acquisition of family dollar will provide us with significant opportunities to achieve meaningful cost synergies we are executing a detailed integration plan and expect to generate approximately 300 million  of estimated run‑rate annual cost synergies by the end of the third full year following the consummation of the acquisition across the areas of 

• sourcing and procurement through driving scale with common vendors increasing direct factory sourcing and 

reducing usage of domestic importers 

• format optimization through the re‑bannering of select dollar tree and family dollar stores to match the banner to 

the customer and tailoring merchandise offerings within existing stores to match local customer tastes 

• distribution and logistics by reducing inbound and outbound freight costs domestic and international and optimizing 

efficiency within our combined distribution center network and 

• overhead through the reduction of shared services costs and redundant public company and board costs 

take advantage of significant whitespace opportunity over the past decade we have built a solid and scalable infrastructure which provides a strong foundation for our future growth we are committed to growing our combined business to take advantage of significant white space opportunities that we believe exist for both the dollar tree and family dollar store concepts using our proven real estate strategy across our combined business we intend to drive future store openings by capitalizing on data‑driven insights regarding location target customer profile competitive dynamics and cost structure over the longterm we believe that we can operate more than 7000  dollar tree stores and 12000  family dollar stores across the united states 

convenient locations and store size we primarily focus on opening new dollar tree stores in strip shopping centers anchored by large retailers who draw target customers we believe to be similar to ours our stores are successful in metropolitan areas midsized cities and small towns the range of our store sizes 8000  10000 selling square feet for dollar tree and 6000  8000 selling square feet for family dollar allows us to target a particular location with a store that best suits that market and takes advantage of available real estate opportunities our stores are attractively designed and create an inviting atmosphere for shoppers by using bright lighting vibrant colors and decorative signs we enhance the store design with attractive merchandise displays we believe this design attracts new and repeat customers and enhances our image as both a destination and impulse purchase store 

we open new family dollar stores in strip shopping centers freestanding buildings and downtown buildings the range of size of our family dollar stores allows us to select store locations in neighborhoods convenient to our customers in each of these market areas 

for more information on retail locations and retail store leases see item 2 properties beginning on page 18 of this form 10k 

profitable stores with strong cash flow we maintain a disciplined costsensitive approach to store site selection in order to minimize the initial capital investment required and maximize our potential to generate high operating margins and strong cash flows we believe that our stores have a relatively small shopping radius which allows us to profitably concentrate multiple stores within a single market our ability to open new stores is dependent upon among other factors locating suitable sites and negotiating favorable lease terms 

the strong cash flows generated by our stores allow us to selffund infrastructure investment and new stores over the past five years cash flows from operating activities have exceeded capital expenditures 

for more information on our results of operations see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations beginning on page 26 of this form 10k 

cost control  we believe that our substantial buying power and our flexibility in making sourcing decisions contributes to our successful purchasing strategy which includes targeted merchandise margin goals by category we also believe our ability to select quality merchandise helps to minimize markdowns we buy products on an orderbyorder basis and have no material longterm purchase contracts or other assurances of continued product supply or guaranteed product cost no vendor accounted for more than 10  of total merchandise purchased in any of the past five years 

our supply chain systems continue to provide us with valuable sales information to assist our buyers and improve merchandise allocation to our stores controlling our inventory levels has resulted in more efficient distribution and store operations 

information systems we believe that investments in technology help us to increase sales and control costs our inventory management system has allowed us to improve the efficiency of our supply chain improve merchandise flow increase inventory turnover and control distribution and store operating costs it is also used to provide information to calculate our estimate of inventory cost under the retail inventory method which is widely used in the retail industry our automatic replenishment system replenishes key items based on actual storelevel sales and inventory 

pointofsale data allows us to track sales and inventory by merchandise category at the store level and assists us in planning for future purchases of inventory we believe that this information allows us to ship the appropriate product to stores at the quantities commensurate with selling patterns using this pointofsale data to plan purchases of inventory has helped us manage our inventory levels 

corporate culture and values we believe that honesty and integrity and treating people fairly and with respect are core values within our corporate culture we believe that running a business and certainly a public company carries with it a responsibility to be above reproach when making operational and financial decisions our executive management team visits 

and shops at our stores like every customer and ideas and individual creativity on the part of our associates are encouraged particularly from our store managers who know their stores and their customers we have standards for store displays merchandise presentation and store operations we maintain an open door policy for all associates our distribution centers are operated based on objective measures of performance and virtually everyone in our store support centers is available to assist associates in the stores and distribution centers 

our disclosure committee meets at least quarterly and monitors our internal controls over financial reporting to ensure that our public filings contain discussions about the risks our business faces we believe that we have the controls in place to be able to certify our financial statements additionally we have complied with the listing requirements for the nasdaq stock market

growth strategy 

store openings and square footage growth the primary factors contributing to our net sales growth have been new store openings an active store expansion and remodel program and selective mergers and acquisitions in the last five years net sales increased at a compound annual growth rate of 236  including the addition of family dollar we expect that the majority of our future sales growth will come primarily from new store openings in our dollar tree and family dollar banners and from our store expansion and relocation program 

at january 28 2012  we operated 4351  stores in the united states and canada at january 30 2016  we operated 13626  stores in 48  states and the district of columbia as well as 225  stores in canada our selling square footage increased from approximately 376 million  square feet in january 2012  to 1084 million  square feet in january 2016  our store growth has resulted from opening new stores and our july 2015  acquisition of more than 8200  family dollar stores 

the following table shows the average selling square footage of our stores and the selling square footage per new store opened over the last five years our growth and productivity statistics are reported based on selling square footage because our management believes the use of selling square footage yields a more accurate measure of store productivity 



we expect to increase the selling square footage in our stores in the future by opening new stores in underserved markets and strategically increasing our presence in our existing markets via new store openings and store expansions expansions include store relocations in fiscal 2016  and beyond we plan to predominantly open dollar tree stores that are approximately 8000   10000  selling square feet and family dollar stores that are approximately 6000   8000  selling square feet we believe these store sizes allow us to achieve our objectives in the markets in which we plan to expand    

in addition to new store openings we plan to continue our dollar tree store expansion program to increase our net sales per store and take advantage of market opportunities we target stores for expansion based on the current sales per selling square foot and changes in market opportunities stores targeted for expansion are generally less than 6000  selling square feet in size store expansions generally increase the existing store size by approximately 2750  selling square feet at january 30 2016  approximately 3243  of our dollar tree stores totaling 63  of our dollar tree banner selling square footage were 8000  selling square feet or larger  

since 1995  we have added a total of 695  stores through several mergers and acquisitions excluding our acquisition of family dollar our acquisition strategy has been to target companies that have a similar singleprice point concept that have shown success in operations or companies that provide a strategic advantage we evaluate potential acquisition opportunities as they become available on july 6 2015  we completed our acquisition of family dollar which allowed us to create a diversified company with complementary business models see note 2  acquisition in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” beginning on page 53 of this form 10k 

from time to time we also acquire the rights to store leases through bankruptcy or other proceedings we will continue to take advantage of these opportunities as they arise depending upon several factors including their fit within our location and selling square footage size parameters 

merchandising and distribution expanding our customer base is important to our growth plans we plan to continue to stock our stores with a compelling mix of everchanging merchandise that our customers have come to appreciate consumable merchandise typically leads to more frequent return trips to our stores resulting in increased sales the presentation and display of merchandise in our stores are critical to communicating value to our customers and creating a more exciting shopping experience we believe our approach to visual merchandising results in higher sales volume and an environment that encourages impulse purchases 

a strong and efficient distribution network is critical to our ability to grow and to maintain a lowcost operating structure in 2015  we began construction on our cherokee county south carolina distribution center which will be 15 million  square feet and fully automated we expect this facility to be operational in the third quarter of 2016  in addition we are expanding our stockton california distribution center by 03 million  square feet we expect this project to be completed during the second quarter of 2016  in 2014  we expanded our joliet illinois distribution center to 15 million  square feet we are also in the process of enabling our distribution centers to ship merchandise to both dollar tree and family dollar stores we expect our first pilot facility to be operational in the third quarter of 2016  we believe our distribution center network is currently capable of supporting approximately 241 billion  in annual sales in the united states new distribution sites are strategically located to reduce stem miles maintain flexibility and improve efficiency in our store service areas we also are a party to an agreement which provides distribution services from two  facilities in canada 

our dollar tree stores receive approximately 90  of their inventory from our distribution centers via contract carriers and our family dollar stores receive approximately 72  of their inventory from our distribution centers the remaining store inventory primarily perishable consumable items and other vendormaintained display items are delivered directly to our stores from vendors our family dollar stores receive approximately 16  of their merchandise from mclane company inc for more information on our distribution center network see item 2 properties beginning on page 18 of this form 10k 

competition 

our segment of the retail industry is highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future we operate in the discount retail business which is currently and is expected to continue to be highly competitive with respect to price store location merchandise quality assortment and presentation and customer service our competitors include singleprice dollar stores multiprice dollar stores mass merchandisers discount retailers drug stores convenience stores independentlyoperated discount stores and a wide variety of other retailers in addition several competitors have sections within their stores devoted to one dollar price point merchandise which further increases competition we believe we differentiate ourselves from other retailers by providing highvalue highquality lowcost merchandise in attractivelydesigned stores that are conveniently located our sales and profits could be reduced by increases in competition there are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector 

trademarks 

we are the owners of several federal service mark registrations including dollar tree the dollar tree logo the dollar tree logo with a “1” and one priceone dollar in addition we own a concurrent use registration for dollar bill and the related logo we also acquired the rights to use trade names previously owned by everythings a dollar a former competitor in the 100 price point industry several trade names were included in the purchase including the marks everythings 100 we mean everything and everythings 100 with the acquisition of deals we became the owners of the trademark deal” with the acquisition of dollar giant we became the owners of the trademark “dollar giant” and others in canada   with the acquisition of family dollar we became the owners of the trademarks family dollar family dollar stores and other names and designs of certain merchandise sold in family dollar stores such as family gourmet family pet kidgets and outdoors by design we have federal trademark registrations for a variety of private labels that we use to market some of our product lines our trademark registrations have various expiration dates however assuming that the trademark registrations are properly renewed they have a perpetual duration 

employees 

we employed approximately 55300  fulltime and 112500  parttime associates on january 30 2016  parttime associates work an average of less than 30 hours per week the number of parttime associates fluctuates depending on seasonal needs we consider our relationship with our associates to be good and we have not experienced significant interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements 




 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk any failure to meet market expectations including our comparable store sales growth rate earnings and earnings per share or new store openings could cause the market price of our stock to decline you should carefully consider the specific risk factors listed below together with all other information included or incorporated in this report any of the following risks may materialize and additional risks not known to us or that we now deem immaterial may arise in such event our business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected 

our profitability is vulnerable to cost increases 

future increases in costs such as the cost of merchandise wage and benefit costs merchandise loss due to theft damage or errors shipping rates freight costs fuel costs and store occupancy costs may reduce our profitability the minimum wage has increased or is scheduled to increase in multiple states and local jurisdictions and there is a possibility that congress will increase the federal minimum wage the department of labor is expected to issue regulations this year that may result in fewer of our associates being exempt from overtime pay requirements in our dollar tree segment we do not raise the sales price of our merchandise to offset cost increases because we are committed to selling primarily at the 100 price point to continue to provide value to the customer we are dependent on our ability to adjust our product assortment to operate more efficiently or to increase our comparable store net sales in order to offset inflation or other cost increases we can give no assurance that we will be able to operate more efficiently or increase our comparable store net sales in the future although family dollar unlike dollar tree can raise the price of merchandise customers may buy fewer products because of a higher price please see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations beginning on page 26 of this form 10k for further discussion of the effect of inflation and other economic factors on our operations 

integrating family dollar’s operations with ours may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits synergies and cost savings of the acquisition may not be realized 

the success of the family dollar acquisition the “acquisition” including anticipated benefits synergies and cost savings will depend in part on our ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses and cultures of the family dollar segment into our company it is possible that the integration process will take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of key employees higher than expected costs including costs incurred with respect to the divested stores and related services ongoing diversion of management attention increased competition the disruption of our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers vendors and employees if we experience difficulties with the integration process the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected in addition the actual cost savings of the acquisition could be less than anticipated 

a downturn in economic conditions could impact our sales 

deterioration in economic conditions such as those caused by a recession inflation higher unemployment consumer debt levels cost increases as well as adverse weather conditions or terrorism could reduce consumer spending or cause customers to shift their spending to products we either do not sell or do not sell as profitably adverse economic conditions could disrupt consumer spending and significantly reduce our sales decrease our inventory turnover cause greater markdowns or reduce our profitability due to lower margins 

a significant disruption in our computer and technology systems could adversely affect our results of operation or business 

we rely extensively on our computer and technology systems to manage inventory process credit card and customer transactions and summarize results systems may be subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunication failures computer viruses security breaches and catastrophic events if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process customer transactions and may receive negative publicity which could adversely affect our results of operation or business 

if we are unable to secure our customers’ credit card and confidential information or other private data relating to our associates suppliers or our business we could be subject to negative publicity costly government enforcement actions or private litigation which could damage our business reputation and adversely affect our results of operation or business 

we have procedures and technology in place to safeguard our customers’ debit and credit card information our associates’ private data suppliers’ data and our business records and intellectual property despite these measures criminals are constantly devising schemes to circumvent safeguards and we may be vulnerable to and unable to detect and appropriately respond to data security breaches and data loss including cybersecurity attacks other sophisticated retailers have recently suffered serious security breaches if we experience a data security breach we could be exposed to negative publicity government enforcement actions private litigation or costly response measures in addition our reputation within the business community and with our customers may be affected which could result in our customers discontinuing the use of debit or credit cards in our stores or not shopping in our stores altogether this could have an adverse effect on our results of operation or business 

our growth is dependent on our ability to increase sales in existing stores and to expand our square footage profitably 

existing store sales growth is critical to good operating results and is dependent on a variety of factors including merchandise quality relevance and availability store operations and customer satisfaction in addition increased competition could adversely affect our sales our highest sales periods are during the christmas and easter seasons and we generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and our operating and net income during the fourth quarter in anticipation we stock extra inventory and hire many temporary employees to prepare our stores a reduction in sales during these periods could adversely affect our operating results particularly operating and net income to a greater extent than if a reduction occurred at other times of the year untimely merchandise delays due to receiving or distribution problems could have a similar effect when easter is observed earlier in the year the selling season is shorter and as a result our sales could be adversely affected easter was observed on april 20 2014 april 5 2015 and will be observed on march 27 2016 

expanding our square footage profitably depends on a number of uncertainties including our ability to locate lease build out and open or expand stores in suitable locations on a timely basis under favorable economic terms obtaining an increasing number of profitable stores is an ever increasing challenge in addition our expansion is dependent upon thirdparty developers’ abilities to acquire land obtain financing and secure necessary permits and approvals it remains difficult for third party developers to obtain financing for new projects due to the recent turmoil in the financial markets we also open or expand stores within our established geographic markets where new or expanded stores may draw sales away from our existing stores we may not manage our expansion effectively and our failure to achieve our expansion plans could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks associated with our domestic and foreign suppliers from whom our products are sourced could affect our financial performance 

we are dependent on our vendors to supply merchandise in a timely and efficient manner if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments due to financial or other difficulties we could experience merchandise shortages which could lead to lost sales or increased merchandise costs if alternative sources must be used 

merchandise imported directly accounts for approximately 41  to 43  of our dollar tree segments total retail value purchases and 22 to 24 of our family dollar segments total retail value purchases in addition we believe that a portion of our goods purchased from domestic vendors is imported china is the source of a substantial majority of our imports imported goods are generally less expensive than domestic goods and increase our profit margins a disruption in the flow of our imported merchandise or an increase in the cost of those goods may significantly decrease our profits risks associated with our reliance on imported goods may include disruptions in the flow of or increases in the cost of imported goods because of factors such as 

• raw material shortages work stoppages strikes and political unrest 

• an increase in duties or tariffs 

• economic crises and international disputes 

• changes in currency exchange rates or policies and local economic conditions including inflation in the country of 

  origin and 

• failure of the united states to maintain normal trade relations with china 

we could encounter disruptions in our distribution network or additional costs in distributing merchandise 

our success is dependent on our ability to transport merchandise to our distribution centers and then ship it to our stores in a timely and costeffective manner we may not anticipate respond to or control all of the challenges of operating our receiving and distribution systems additionally if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments we could experience merchandise shortages that could lead to lost sales or increased costs some of the factors that could have an adverse effect on our distribution network or costs are 

• shipping disruption our oceanic shipping schedules may be disrupted or delayed from time to time 

• shipping costs we could experience increases in shipping rates imposed by the transpacific ocean carriers changes 

in import duties import quotas and other trade sanctions could increase our costs 

• efficient operations   distribution centers and other aspects of our distribution network are difficult to operate 

efficiently and we could experience a reduction in operating efficiency 

• diesel fuel costs we have experienced volatility in diesel fuel costs over the past few years 

• vulnerability to natural or manmade disasters a fire explosion or natural disaster at a port or any of our distribution 

facilities could result in a loss of merchandise and impair our ability to adequately stock our stores some facilities are 

  vulnerable to earthquakes hurricanes or tornadoes 

• labor disagreement labor disagreements disruptions or strikes may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise 

to our distribution centers or stores and increase costs 

• war terrorism and other events war and acts of terrorism in the united states the middle east or in china or other 

parts of asia where we buy a significant amount of our imported merchandise could disrupt our supply chain or 

increase our transportation costs 

• economic conditions suppliers may encounter financial or other difficulties 

our profitability is affected by the mix of products we sell 

our gross profit margin could decrease if we increase the proportion of higher cost goods we sell in the future in recent years the percentage of our sales from higher cost consumable products has increased and we can give no assurance that this trend will not continue as a result our gross profit margin could decrease unless we are able to maintain our current merchandise cost sufficiently to offset any decrease in our product margin percentage we can give no assurance that we will be able to do so 

in our family dollar segment our success also depends on our ability to select and obtain sufficient quantities of relevant merchandise at prices that allow us to sell such merchandise at profitable and appropriate prices a sales price that is too high causes products to be less attractive to our customers and our sales at family dollar could suffer we are continuing to implement our everyday low price strategy at family dollar to drive customer loyalty and have a strategic pricing team to improve our value and to increase profitability inability to successfully implement our pricing strategies at family dollar could have a negative effect on our business 

in addition our family dollar segment has a substantial number of private brand items and the number of items has been increasing we believe our success in maintaining broad market acceptance of our private brands depends on many factors including our pricing costs quality and customer perception we may not achieve or maintain our expected sales for our private brands and as a result our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted additionally the increased number of private brands could negatively impact our existing relationships with our nonprivate brand suppliers 

pressure from competitors may reduce our sales and profits 

the retail industry is highly competitive the marketplace is highly fragmented as many different retailers compete for market share by utilizing a variety of store formats and merchandising strategies we expect competition to increase in the future there are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector some of our current or potential competitors have greater financial resources than we do we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors please see item 1 business beginning on page 6 of this form 10k for further discussion of the effect of competition on our operations 

litigation may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to the risk of litigation involving employees consumers suppliers competitors shareholders government agencies or others through private actions class actions governmental investigations administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation our products could also cause illness or injury harm our reputation and subject us to litigation for example we are currently defendants in national and state employmentrelated class and collective actions litigation concerning injury from products and a governmental investigation by the consumer products safety commission 

the outcome of litigation is difficult to assess or quantify plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits or proceedings may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss may remain unknown for substantial periods of time in addition certain of these matters if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in an expense that may be material to our financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operation are required the cost to defend current and future litigation or proceedings may be significant there also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation including litigation related to product or food safety customer information and environmental or safety requirements which could negatively affect customer perception of our business regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable 

for a discussion of current legal matters please see item 3 legal proceedings beginning on page 21 of this form 10k and note 5  commitments and contingencies under the caption contingencies in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data beginning on page 59 of this form 10k resolution of these matters if decided against the company could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations accrued liabilities or cash flows 

changes in federal state or local law or our failure to comply with such laws could increase our expenses and expose us to legal risks 

our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations the department of labor is expected to issue regulations this year that may result in fewer of our associates being exempt from overtime pay requirements the minimum wage has increased or is scheduled to increase in multiple states and local jurisdictions and there is a possibility that congress will increase the federal minimum wage significant legislative changes such as the healthcare legislation that impact our relationship with our workforce could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations changes in other regulatory areas such as consumer credit privacy and information security product and food safety worker safety or environmental protection among others could cause our expenses to increase or product recalls in addition if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations particularly wage and hour laws we could be subject to legal risk including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation which could adversely affect our results of operations changes in tax laws the interpretation of existing laws or our failure to sustain our reporting positions on examination could adversely affect our effective tax rate 

our business could be adversely affected if we fail to attract and retain qualified associates and key personnel 

our growth and performance is dependent on the skills experience and contributions of our associates executives and key personnel various factors including our recent merger overall labor availability wage rates regulatory or legislative impacts and benefit costs could impact our ability to attract and retain qualified associates at our stores distribution centers and corporate offices 

certain provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws could delay or discourage a change of control transaction that may be in a shareholder’s best interest 

our articles of incorporation and bylaws currently contain provisions that may delay or discourage a takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider in his best interest these provisions among other things 

• provide that only the board of directors chairman or president may call special meetings of the shareholders 

• establish certain advance notice procedures for nominations of candidates for election as directors and for shareholder 

proposals to be considered at shareholders’ meetings and 

• permit the board of directors without further action of the shareholders to issue and fix the terms of preferred stock 

which may have rights senior to those of the common stock 

however we believe that these provisions allow our board of directors to negotiate a higher price in the event of a takeover attempt which would be in the best interest of our shareholders 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition limit our ability to obtain additional financing restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures 

in connection with the acquisition we substantially increased our indebtedness which could adversely affect our ability to fulfill our obligations and have a negative impact on our financing options and liquidity position as of january 30 2016  our total indebtedness is 74655 million  in addition we have 12500 million  of additional borrowing availability under our new revolving credit facility less amounts outstanding for letters of credit totaling 1230 million  

our high level of debt could have significant consequences including the following 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or 

other general corporate purposes 

• requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes 

thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 

• limiting our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all 

• imposing restrictive covenants on our operations 

• placing us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors carrying less debt and 

• making us more vulnerable to economic downturns and limiting our ability to withstand competitive pressures 

in addition our credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and accordingly our cost of capital our ratings reflect the opinions of the ratings agencies of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations there can be no assurance that we will achieve a particular rating or maintain a particular rating in the future 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to fund our daytoday operations or to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations and other cash requirements we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to sell assets or operations seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to effect any such alternative measures if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful such alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations the agreements that govern our indebtedness restrict a our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from any such dispositions and b our ability to raise debt capital to be used to repay our indebtedness when it becomes due we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our obligations 

if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default and as a result holders of the notes and lenders under any of our existing and future indebtedness could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable the lenders under the credit facilities could terminate their commitments to loan money our secured lenders could foreclose against the assets securing such borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation in each case which could result in your losing your investment 

the terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness may restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to pursue our business strategies and could adversely affect our capital resources financial condition and liquidity 

the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interests including among other things restrictions on our ability to 

• incur assume or guarantee additional indebtedness 

• declare or pay dividends or make other distributions with respect to or purchase or otherwise acquire or retire for 

value equity interests 

• make principal payments on or redeem or repurchase subordinated debt 

• make loans advances or other investments 

• incur liens 

• sell or otherwise dispose of assets including capital stock of subsidiaries 

• enter into sale and leaseback transactions 

• consolidate or merge with or into or sell all or substantially all of our assets to another person and 

• enter into transactions with affiliates 

in addition certain of these agreements require us to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants our ability to satisfy these financial maintenance covenants can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot assure you that we will meet them 

a breach of the covenants under these agreements could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness which if not cured or waived could result in us having to repay our borrowings before their due dates such default may allow the debt holders to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies if we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or if we were to experience difficulty in refinancing the debt prior to maturity our results of operations or financial condition could be materially affected in addition an event of default under our credit facilities may permit the lenders under our credit facilities to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under such credit facilities furthermore if we are unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our credit facilities those lenders may be able to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness in the event our lenders or holders of notes accelerate the repayment of such borrowings we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay such indebtedness 

as a result of these restrictions we may be 

• limited in how we conduct our business 

• unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns or 

• unable to compete effectively take advantage of new business opportunities or grow in accordance with our plans 

our variablerate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our annual debt service obligations to increase significantly 

certain of our indebtedness including borrowings under our new revolving credit facility is subject to variable rates of interest and exposes us to interest rate risk if interest rates increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income would decrease an increase decrease of 10  on the interest rate would result in an increase decrease of 252 million  in annual interest expense although we may enter into interest rate swaps involving the exchange of floating for fixedrate interest payments to reduce interest rate volatility we cannot assure you we will be able to do so

overview 

we are a leading operator of more than 13800  discount retail stores and we conduct our operations in two  reporting segments our dollar tree segment is the leading operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise at the fixed price point of 100  our family dollar segment operates general merchandise discount retail stores providing consumers with a selection of competitivelypriced merchandise in convenient neighborhood stores 

our net sales are derived from the sale of merchandise two major factors tend to affect our net sales trends first is our success at opening new stores or adding new stores through mergers or acquisitions second is the performance of our stores once they are open sales vary at our existing stores from one year to the next we refer to this change as a change in comparable store net sales because we compare only those stores that are open throughout both of the periods being compared beginning after the first fifteen months of operation we include sales from stores expanded during the year in the calculation of comparable store net sales which has the effect of increasing our comparable store net sales the term expanded also includes stores that are relocated our comparable store net sales calculation only includes our dollar tree stores as our family dollar stores were acquired on july 6 2015  stores that have been rebannered are considered to be new stores and are not included in the calculation of comparable store net sales until after the first fifteen months of operation under the new banner 

at january 30 2016  we operated stores in 48  states and the district of columbia as well as stores in five  canadian provinces a breakdown of store counts and square footage by segment for the years ended january 30 2016  and january 31 2015  respectively are as follows family dollars beginning amounts are as of the july 6 2015  acquisition date 



stores are included as rebanners when they close or open respectively comparable store net sales for dollar tree may be negatively affected when a family dollar store is rebannered near an existing dollar tree store the average size of stores opened in 2015  was approximately 8030  selling square feet or about 10000  gross square feet for the dollar tree segment and 7000  selling square feet or about 8200  gross square feet for the family dollar segment for 2016  we continue to plan to open stores that are approximately 8000   10000  selling square feet or about 10000   12000  gross square feet for the dollar tree segment and approximately 6000   8000  selling square feet or about 7000   9000  gross square feet for the family dollar segment we believe that these size stores are in the ranges of our optimal sizes operationally and give our customers a shopping environment which invites them to shop longer buy more and make return visits which increases our customer traffic 

fiscal 2015  fiscal 2014  and fiscal 2013  which ended on january 30 2016  january 31 2015  and february 1 2014  respectively each included 52 weeks 

in fiscal 2015  comparable store net sales increased by 21  the comparable store net sales increase was the result of a 14  increase in the number of transactions and a 08  increase in average ticket we believe comparable store net sales continued to be positively affected by a number of our dollar tree initiatives as debit and credit card penetration continued to increase in 2015  and we continued the rollout of frozen and refrigerated merchandise to more of our dollar tree stores at january 30 2016  the dollar tree segment had frozen and refrigerated merchandise in approximately 4285  stores which includes rebannered stores compared to approximately 3620  stores at january 31 2015  we believe that the addition of frozen and refrigerated product enables us to increase sales and earnings by increasing the number of shopping trips made by our customers in addition the dollar tree segment accepts food stamps under the supplemental nutrition assistance program “snap” in approximately 5600  qualified stores compared to 5000  at the end of 2014  

our pointofsale technology provides us with valuable sales and inventory information to assist our buyers and improve our merchandise allocation to our stores we believe that this has enabled us to better manage our inventory flow in our stores resulting in more efficient distribution and store operations 

we must continue to control our merchandise costs inventory levels and our general and administrative expenses as increases in these items could negatively impact our operating results 

we previously announced that we will rebanner our deals stores in 2015 and 2016 the majority of the deals stores will be rebannered as dollar tree stores and the remaining stores will be rebannered as family dollar stores in 2015  52  stores were rebannered and we recorded 155 million  in expenses in connection with the rebannering in fiscal 2015  

acquisition 

on july 27 2014  we executed an agreement and plan of merger to acquire family dollar in a cash and stock transaction on july 6 2015  the acquisition date we completed the acquisition and family dollar became a direct whollyowned subsidiary under the acquisition the family dollar shareholders received 5960  in cash and 02484  shares of our common stock for each share of family dollar common stock they owned plus cash in lieu of fractional shares the merger consideration 

as of the acquisition date each outstanding performance share right of family dollar common stock was canceled in exchange for the right of the holder to receive the merger consideration the psr payment the aggregate amount we paid for the merger consideration and psr payment was 68 billion  in cash and we issued 285 million  shares of our common stock valued at 23 billion  based on the closing price of our common stock on july 2 2015  

for a complete description of the acquisition refer to our current report on form 8k filed with the sec on july 8 2015  

we incurred 392 million  and 285 million  in acquisitionrelated expenses in 2015  and 2014  respectively excluding acquisitionrelated interest expense we also expended approximately 1657 million  in capitalizable debt issuance costs related to the financing of the acquisition and 1298 million  of debtissuance costs was included as a reduction in longterm debt net excluding current portion at january 30 2016  

we expect to achieve approximately 300 million  in annual cost savings synergies by the end of the third year after closing and that we will incur 300 million  in onetime costs to achieve these synergies we project that the acquisition will be dilutive to earnings per share in the first twelve months following closing on a gaap basis however we expect it will be accretive excluding the onetime costs to achieve synergies 

in 2015  we completed the offering of 325 billion  of senior notes and entered into a credit facility and term loan providing for 62 billion  in senior secured credit facilities see liquidity and capital resources for a further discussion of these transactions 

in connection with the acquisition we agreed to divest 330  family dollar stores to settle federal trade commission charges that the acquisition would be anticompetitive in certain local markets the 330  family dollar stores represent approximately 455 million  of annual operating income in accordance with purchase accounting the net effect of the divestiture on our assets and liabilities is fully reflected in the table summarizing the preliminary estimates of fair value set forth in note 2  acquisition and the consolidated balance sheet of dollar tree inc as of january 30 2016  included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k the divestiture was completed on november 1 2015  and the primary expected future effect of the sale on the consolidated income statements of dollar tree inc will be that we will lose the operating income associated with the divested stores and will incur approximately 50 million  to 100 million  in closing costs and setup costs for transition services over a period expected to be no more than 24  months we will provide certain transition services to the buyer for which we expect to be reimbursed by the buyer at our direct operating costs for those services

gross profit   gross profit increased by 16227 million or 535 to 46567 million in 2015 compared to 30340 million in 2014 the dollar increase in gross profit was primarily driven by 14074 million of gross profit for family dollar as well as higher sales for dollar tree our gross profit margin is negatively impacted by the overall lowermargin product mix for the family dollar segment included in family dollars cost of sales is 730 million of markdown expense related to sku rationalization and planned liquidations and 702 million for amortization of the steppedup inventory value for inventory which was sold during 2015 

selling general and administrative expenses  selling general and administrative expenses for 2015 increased to 36070 million from 19938 million in 2014 an increase of 16132 million or 809 the increase was primarily due to 14382 million of expense for family dollar as a percentage of net sales selling general and administrative expenses increased to 233 for 2015 compared to 232 for 2014 in 2015 we incurred 391 million or 25 basis points of expenses related to the acquisition compared to 285 million or 35 basis points in 2014 excluding acquisition expenses the selling general and administrative rate increased to 230 in 2015 compared to 228 in 2014 the increase is primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net sales resulting from the recording of favorable lease rights and fixed assets at their fair values in connection with the acquisition 

operating income  operating income for 2015 increased to 10497 million compared with 10402 million in 2014 an increase of 95 million or 09 operating income margin decreased from 121 in 2014 to 68 in 2015 the increase in operating income was due to a 403 million increase in the dollar tree segment partially offset by a 308 million operating loss in the family dollar segment the decrease in operating income margin is a result of the family dollar segment operating loss due to unusually high markdowns related to sku rationalization and planned liquidations and the amortization of steppedup inventory sold in 2015 as well as higher depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net sales resulting from the recording of favorable lease rights and fixed assets at their fair values in connection with the acquisition

 29 

income taxes  our effective tax rate was 370  in 2015 compared to 372  in 2014 the rate decrease is due to the utilization of a capital loss to offset the previously recognized gain on our investment in ollies holdings inc and additional work opportunity tax credits partially offset by an increase in the valuation allowance 

fiscal year ended january 31 2015  compared to fiscal year ended february 1 2014

gross profit   gross profit margin was 353 in 2014 compared to 356 in 2013 due to increased freight costs partially offset by leverage in occupancy costs from the higher comparable store sales increase 

selling general and administrative expenses  selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales remained at 232 for 2014 compared to 2013 excluding 285 million or approximately 35 basis points of expenses related to the family dollar acquisition the selling general and administrative rate was 229 the decrease is primarily due to lower store payroll health insurance and workers compensation costs 

operating income  operating income margin was 121 in 2014 compared to 124 in 2013 excluding the approximately 35 basis points of acquisitionrelated expenses operating income margin was 124 in 2014 as lower selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were offset by lower gross profit margin for the reasons noted above

segment information 

we operate a chain of more than 13800  retail discount stores in 48  states and five  canadian provinces our operations are conducted in two  reporting business segments dollar tree and family dollar we define our segments as those operations whose results our chief operating decision maker codm regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources 

the dollar tree segment is the leading operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise at the fixed price of 100  the dollar tree segment includes our operations under the dollar tree dollar tree canada deals and dollar tree deals brands ten  distribution centers in the united states and two  in canada and a store support center in chesapeake virginia 

the family dollar segment operates a chain of general merchandise retail discount stores providing consumers with a selection of competitively priced merchandise in convenient neighborhood stores the family dollar segment consists of our operations under the family dollar brand eleven  distribution centers and a store support center in matthews north carolina 

we measure the results of our segments using among other measures each segments net sales gross profit and operating income loss we may revise the measurement of each segments operating income including the allocation of distribution center and store support center costs as determined by the information regularly reviewed by the codm when the measurement of a segment changes previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current periods presentation 

because the acquisition occurred in the fiscal year ended january 30 2016  comparable information for the family dollar segment is not provided in addition results for the fiscal year ended january 31 2015  and the fiscal year ended february 1 2014  only include the dollar tree segment therefore comparative information for these periods which is included above is not provided in this discussion 

the following table summarizes the operating results of the dollar tree segment 



net sales for dollar tree increased 85 in 2015  compared to 2014  due to sales from new stores and a comparable store sales increase of 25 on a constant currency basis 

gross profit margin for dollar tree decreased to 348  in 2015  compared to 353  in 2014  the decrease in gross profit margin was due to 

 operating income margin for dollar tree decreased to 116  in 2015  compared to 121  in 2014  excluding acquisition costs of 392 million  or 40 basis points in 2015  and 285 million  or 35 basis points in 2014  operating income margin was 120 and 124 in 2015  and 2014  respectively excluding acquisition costs the decrease in operating income margin was the result of lower gross profit margin as noted above and higher professional fees related to the family dollar integration partially offset by lower payroll costs as a percentage of net sales due to lower profit sharing contributions 

liquidity and capital resources 

our business requires capital to build and open new stores expand our distribution network and operate and expand existing stores our working capital requirements for existing stores are seasonal and usually reach their peak in september and october historically we have satisfied our seasonal working capital requirements for existing stores and have funded our store opening and distribution network expansion programs from internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities

letters of credit and surety bonds  we are a party to three  letter of credit reimbursement and security agreements providing 1200 million  1100 million  and 1000 million  respectively for letters of credit letters of credit are generally issued for the routine purchase of imported merchandise and we had approximately 2101 million  of purchases committed under these letters of credit at january 30 2016  

we also have approximately 1230 million  of letters of credit outstanding that serve as collateral for our largedeductible insurance programs and 479 million  of surety bonds outstanding primarily for certain utility payment obligations at some of our stores and selfinsured insurance programs subsequent to yearend amounts outstanding for standby letters of credit increased to 1833 million  as of february 10 2016 

technology assets we have commitments totaling approximately 70 million to primarily purchase store technology assets and maintenance for our stores during 2016 

telecommunication contracts we have contracted for telecommunication services with contracts expiring in 2020  the total amount of these commitments is approximately 1427 million  

derivative financial instruments 

in 2015  2014  and 2013  we were party to fuel derivative contracts with third parties which included approximately 66 million  16 million  and 28 million  gallons of diesel fuel or approximately 36  10  and 20  of the dollar tree segments domestic truckload fuel needs respectively these derivative contracts did not qualify for hedge accounting and therefore all changes in fair value for these derivatives are included in earnings 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates certain of our estimates require a high level of judgment and have the potential to have a material effect on the financial statements if actual results vary significantly   from those estimates following is a discussion of the estimates that we consider critical 

inventory valuation 

as discussed in note 1  summary of significant accounting policies under the caption merchandise inventories in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data beginning on page 48 of this form 10k inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weightedaverage basis cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weightedaverage basis under the retail inventory method the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated costtoretail ratio to the retail value of inventories the retail inventory method is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis 

inventory valuation methods require certain significant management estimates and judgments including estimates of future merchandise markdowns and shrink which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins the averaging required in applying the retail inventory method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns could under certain circumstances result in costs not being recorded in the proper period 

we estimate our markdown reserve based on the consideration of a variety of factors including but not limited to quantities of slow moving or seasonal carryover merchandise on hand historical markdown statistics and future merchandising plans the accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors some of which are outside of our control including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends historically we have not experienced significant differences in our estimated reserve for markdowns compared with actual results 

our accrual for shrink is based on the actual historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories adjusted if necessary for current economic conditions and business trends these estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger our physical inventory counts are generally taken between january and september of each year therefore the shrink accrual recorded at january 30 2016 is based on estimated shrink for most of 2015 including the fourth quarter we have not experienced significant fluctuations in historical shrink rates beyond approximately 1020 basis points in our dollar tree segment for the last few years however we have sometimes experienced higher than typical shrink in acquired stores in the year following an acquisition the amounts recorded in the current year reflect the dollar tree and family dollar segments’ historical results we periodically adjust our shrink estimates to address these factors as they become apparent 

our management believes that our application of the retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market each year on a consistent basis 

in our family dollar segment we receive vendor support in the form of cash payments or allowances through a variety of reimbursements such as purchase discounts cooperative advertising markdowns scandowns and volume rebates we have agreements with vendors setting forth the specific conditions for each allowance or payment in accordance with asc 60550 revenue recognition  customer payments and incentives depending on the arrangement we either recognize the allowance as a reduction of current costs or recognize the benefit over the period the related merchandise is sold if the payment is a reimbursement for costs incurred it is offset against those related costs otherwise it is treated as a reduction to cost of goods sold 

accrued expenses 

on a monthly basis we estimate certain expenses in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred certain expenses such as legal reserves require a high degree of judgment and our most material estimates include domestic freight expenses selfinsurance costs storelevel operating expenses such as property taxes and utilities and certain other expenses 

we are involved in numerous legal proceedings and claims our accruals if any related to these proceedings and claims are based on a determination of whether or not the loss is both probable and estimable we review outstanding matters with external counsel to assess the probability of an unfavorable outcome and estimates of loss we reevaluate outstanding proceedings and claims each quarter or as new and significant information becomes available and we adjust or establish accruals if necessary our legal proceedings are described in note 5  commitments and contingencies under the caption contingencies in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data beginning on page 59 of this form 10k 

our freight and storelevel operating expenses are estimated based on current activity and historical trends and results our workers compensation general liability and health insurance accruals are recorded based on thirdparty actuarial valuations which we obtain at least annually for our workers compensation and general liability accruals these actuarial valuations are estimates based on our historical loss development factors for our health insurance accrual the actuary provides an estimate based on historical claims and claim payment timing certain other expenses are estimated and recorded in the periods that management becomes aware of them the related accruals are adjusted as management’s estimates change 

differences in managements estimates and assumptions could result in expenses which are materially different from the calculated accruals our experience has been that some of our estimates are too high and others are too low historically the net total of these differences has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

business combinationspurchase price allocation 

for the family dollar acquisition we allocated the purchase price to the various tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values which are preliminary as of january 30 2016 determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities is subjective in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions which are inherently uncertain we engaged third party experts to assist in the determination of fair value for complex assets and liabilities many of the estimates and assumptions used to determine fair values such as those used for intangible assets are made based on forecasted information and discount rates in addition the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as asset lives can materially impact our results of operations 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

indefinitelived intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair values these assets including goodwill are not amortized but are evaluated annually for impairment an additional evaluation is performed if events or circumstances indicate that impairment could have occurred such events or circumstances could include but are not limited to significant negative industry or economic trends unanticipated changes in the competitive environment and a significant sustained decline in the market price of our stock 

for purposes of our goodwill impairment evaluation the reporting units are family dollar dollar tree and dollar tree canada goodwill has been assigned to the reporting units based on prior business combinations related to the brands we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using projected future cash flows that are discounted using a weightedaverage cost of capital analysis that reflects current market conditions management judgment is a significant factor in the goodwill impairment evaluation process the computations require management to make estimates and assumptions actual values may differ significantly from these judgments particularly if there are significant adverse changes in the operating environments for our reporting units critical assumptions that are used as part of these evaluations include 

• the potential future cash flows of the reporting unit   the projections use managements estimates of economic and 

market conditions over the projected period including growth rates in revenue gross margin and expense the cash flows are based on our most recent business operating plans and various growth rates have been assumed for years beyond the current business plan period we believe that the assumptions and rates used in our 2015 impairment evaluations are reasonable however variations in the assumptions and rates could result in significantly different estimates of fair value 

 indefinitelived intangible assets such as the family dollar tradename are not subject to amortization but are reviewed at least annually for impairment the indefinitelived intangible asset impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible assets to their carrying values we estimate the fair value of tradename intangible assets based on an income approach using the relieffromroyalty method this approach is dependent upon a number of factors including estimates of future growth and trends royalty rates discount rates and other variables we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain our impairment evaluation of indefinitelived intangible assets did not result in an impairment charge 

income taxes 

on a quarterly basis we estimate our required income tax liability and assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets our income taxes payable are estimated based on currently enacted tax rates and estimated state apportionment factors management assesses the recoverability of deferred tax assets based on the availability of carrybacks of future deductible amounts and management’s projections for future taxable income we cannot guarantee that we will generate taxable income in future years historically we have not experienced significant differences in our estimates of our tax accrual 

in addition we have a recorded liability for our estimate of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns judgment is required in evaluating the application of federal and state tax laws including relevant case law and assessing whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination and if so judgment is also required as to the measurement of the amount of tax benefit that will be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or the final outcome differs from the amounts recorded we believe that our liability for uncertain tax positions is adequate for further discussion of our changes in reserves during 2015 see note 4  income taxes in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data beginning on page 56 of this form 10k 

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations 

we experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales comparable store net sales operating income and net income and expect this trend to continue our results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors including 

 our highest sales periods are the christmas and easter seasons easter was observed on april 20 2014  and on april 5 2015  and will be observed on march 27 2016  we believe that the earlier easter in 2016 could result in a 100 million  decrease in sales in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to the first quarter of 2015 we generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and of our operating and net income during the fourth quarter in anticipation of increased sales activity during these months we purchase substantial amounts of inventory and hire a significant number of temporary employees to supplement our continuing store staff our operating results particularly operating and net income could suffer if our net sales were below seasonal norms during the fourth quarter or during the easter season for any reason including merchandise delivery delays due to receiving or distribution problems changes in consumer sentiment or inclement weather 

our unaudited results of operations for the eight most recent quarters are shown in a table in note 12  quarterly financial information unaudited in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data beginning on page 75 of this form 10k 

inflation and other economic factors 

our ability to provide quality merchandise at a fixed price in our dollar tree stores and on a profitable basis may be subject to economic factors and influences that we cannot control consumer spending could decline because of economic pressures including unemployment and rising fuel prices reductions in consumer confidence and spending could have an adverse effect on our sales national or international events including war or terrorism could lead to disruptions in economies in the united states or in foreign countries these and other factors could increase our merchandise costs fuel costs and other costs that are critical to our operations such as shipping and wage rates 

shipping costs  transpacific shipping rates are negotiated with individual freight lines and are subject to fluctuation based on shipping industry market conditions and fuel costs  we can give no assurances as to the final rate trends for 2016 as we are in the early stages of our negotiations 

minimum wage   multiple states and local jurisdictions passed legislation that increased their minimum wages in 2016 and 2017 and the federal government has made indications that it may consider increasing the federal minimum wage as a result we believe our expenses will increase except to the extent that we are able to offset our payroll costs with savings in our operations 

currency fluctuations we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our operations in canada 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of our business including the impact of interest rate changes and diesel fuel cost changes we may enter into interest rate or diesel fuel swaps to manage exposure to interest rate and diesel fuel price changes we do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging and we do not hold derivative instruments for trading purposes 

interest rate risk 

in conjunction with the acquisition we entered into new financing arrangements as described in note 6  longterm debt in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data beginning on page 63 of this form 10k borrowings under the term loan a bear interest based on libor plus 225  and borrowings under term loan b1 bear interest at the higher of libor plus 275  or 350  as such these debt instruments expose us to market risk for changes in interest rates as of january 30 2016  approximately 45  of our total debt includes variable interest rates however the terms of the term loan b1 limit our exposure to shortterm interest rate fluctuations due to the existence of the interest rate floor of 350  as current monthly libor rates plus the 275  spread are below the interest rate floor of 350  term loan b1 effectively has a fixed interest rate unless monthly libor rates were to increase above 075  a 10  increase in the libor rate would result in an annual increase in interest expense related to our variable rate debt of 252 million  

diesel fuel cost risk 

in order to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in diesel fuel costs we entered into fuel derivative contracts with third parties we hedged 66 million  16 million  and 28 million  gallons of diesel fuel in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively these hedges represented approximately 36  10  and 20  of the dollar tree segments total domestic truckload fuel needs in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively under these contracts we pay the third party a fixed price for diesel fuel and receive variable diesel fuel prices at amounts approximating current diesel fuel costs thereby creating the economic equivalent of a fixedrate obligation these derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and therefore all changes in fair value for these derivatives are included in earnings the fair value of these contracts as of january 30 2016  was a liability of 08 million

 item 1 business 

overview 

we are the leading operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise at the fixed price of 100 we believe the variety and value of products we sell for 100 sets us apart from our competitors at january 31 2015  we operated 5367  discount variety retail stores our stores operate under the names of dollar tree deals dollar tree deals dollar tree canada dollar giant and dollar bills in 5148  of these stores we sell substantially all items for 100 or less in the united states and 125cad or less in canada in substantially all of the remaining stores operating as deals or dollar tree deals we sell items for 100 or less but also sell items for more than 100 

we believe our optimal store size is between 8000  and 10000  selling square feet this store size provides the appropriate amount of space for our broad merchandise offerings while allowing us to provide ease of shopping to our customers as we have been expanding our merchandise offerings we have added freezers and coolers to approximately 3620  stores to increase sales and shopping frequency at january 29 2011 we operated 4101  stores in the united states and canada at january 31 2015  we operated 5157  stores in 48 states and the district of columbia as well as 210  stores in canada our revenue and assets in canada are not material our selling square footage increased from approximately 351 million  square feet in january 2011  to 465 million  square feet in january 2015  our store growth has resulted primarily from opening new stores 

business strategy 

value merchandise offering  we strive to exceed our customers expectations of the variety and quality of products that they can purchase for 100 by offering items that we believe typically sell for higher prices elsewhere we buy approximately 59  to 61  of our merchandise domestically and import the remaining 39  to 41  our domestic purchases include basic seasonal closeouts and promotional merchandise we believe our mix of imported and domestic merchandise affords our buyers flexibility that allows them to consistently exceed the customers expectations in addition direct relationships with manufacturers permit us to select from a broad range of products and customize packaging product sizes and package quantities that meet our customers needs 

mix of basic variety and seasonal merchandise we maintain a balanced selection of products within traditional variety store categories we offer a wide selection of everyday basic products and we supplement these basic everyday items with seasonal closeout and promotional merchandise we attempt to keep certain basic consumable merchandise in our stores continuously to establish our stores as a destination and increase the traffic in our stores closeout and promotional merchandise is purchased opportunistically and represents less than 10  of our purchases 

our merchandise mix consists of 

 we added freezers and coolers to certain stores and increased the amount of consumable merchandise carried by those stores we believe this initiative helps drive additional transactions and allows us to appeal to a broader demographic mix we added freezers and coolers to 460  additional stores in 2014  therefore as of january 31 2015  we have freezers and coolers in 3620  of our stores we plan to install them in 320  additional stores by the end of fiscal 2015  

the following table shows the percentage of net sales of each major product group for the years ended january 31 2015  and february 1 2014  



at any point in time we carry approximately 6800  items in our stores and as of the end of 2014  approximately 35  of our items are automatically replenished the remaining items are pushed to the stores and a portion can be reordered by our store managers on a weekly basis through automatic replenishment and our store managers’ ability to order product each store manager is able to satisfy the demands of his or her particular customer base 

customer payment methods all of our stores in the united states accept cash checks debit cards and credit cards  along with the rollout of freezers and coolers we have increased the number of stores accepting electronic benefits transfer ebt cards and food stamps under the supplemental nutrition assistance program “snap” to approximately 5000  stores as of january 31 2015  

convenient locations and store size we primarily focus on opening new stores in strip shopping centers anchored by large retailers who draw target customers we believe to be similar to ours our stores are successful in metropolitan areas midsized cities and small towns the range of our store sizes allows us to target a particular location with a store that best suits that market and takes advantage of available real estate opportunities our stores are attractively designed and create an inviting atmosphere for shoppers by using bright lighting vibrant colors and decorative signs we enhance the store design with attractive merchandise displays we believe this design attracts new and repeat customers and enhances our image as both a destination and impulse purchase store 

for more information on retail locations and retail store leases see item 2 properties” beginning on page 19 of this form 10k 

profitable stores with strong cash flow we maintain a disciplined costsensitive approach to store site selection in order to minimize the initial capital investment required and maximize our potential to generate high operating margins and strong cash flows we believe that our stores have a relatively small shopping radius which allows us to profitably concentrate multiple stores within a single market our ability to open new stores is dependent upon among other factors locating suitable sites and negotiating favorable lease terms 

the strong cash flows generated by our stores allow us to selffund infrastructure investment and new stores over the past five years cash flows from operating activities have exceeded capital expenditures 

for more information on our results of operations see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” beginning on page 25 of this form 10k 

cost control  we believe that our substantial buying power and our flexibility in making sourcing decisions contributes to our successful purchasing strategy which includes targeted merchandise margin goals by category we also believe our ability to select quality merchandise helps to minimize markdowns we buy products on an orderbyorder basis and have no material longterm purchase contracts or other assurances of continued product supply or guaranteed product cost no vendor accounted for more than 10 of total merchandise purchased in any of the past five years 

our supply chain systems continue to provide us with valuable sales information to assist our buyers and improve merchandise allocation to our stores controlling our inventory levels has resulted in more efficient distribution and store operations 

information systems we believe that investments in technology help us to increase sales and control costs our inventory management system has allowed us to improve the efficiency of our supply chain improve merchandise flow increase inventory turnover and control distribution and store operating costs it is also used to provide information to calculate our estimate of inventory cost under the retail inventory method which is widely used in the retail industry our automatic replenishment system replenishes key items based on actual store level sales and inventory at the end of 2014  approximately 35  of our items are on automatic replenishment 

pointofsale data allows us to track sales and inventory by merchandise category at the store level and assists us in planning for future purchases of inventory we believe that this information allows us to ship the appropriate product to stores at the quantities commensurate with selling patterns using this pointofsale data to plan purchases of inventory has helped us manage our inventory levels 

corporate culture and values we believe that honesty and integrity doing the right things for the right reasons and treating people fairly and with respect are core values within our corporate culture we believe that running a business and certainly a public company carries with it a responsibility to be above reproach when making operational and financial decisions our executive management team visits and shops our stores like every customer and ideas and individual creativity on the part of our associates are encouraged particularly from our store managers who know their stores and their customers we have standards for store displays merchandise presentation and store operations we maintain an open door 

policy for all associates our distribution centers are operated based on objective measures of performance and virtually everyone in our store support center is available to assist associates in the stores and distribution centers 

our disclosure committee meets at least quarterly and monitors our internal controls over financial reporting to ensure that our public filings contain discussions about the risks our business faces we believe that we have the controls in place to be able to certify our financial statements additionally we have complied with the listing requirements for the nasdaq stock market

growth strategy 

store openings and square footage growth the primary factors contributing to our net sales growth have been new store openings an active store expansion and remodel program and selective mergers and acquisitions in the last five years net sales increased at a compound annual growth rate of 100  we expect that the majority of our future sales growth will come primarily from new store openings and from our store expansion and relocation program 

the following table shows the average selling square footage of our stores and the selling square footage per new store opened over the last five years our growth and productivity statistics are reported based on selling square footage because our management believes the use of selling square footage yields a more accurate measure of store productivity 



we expect to increase the selling square footage in our dollar tree stores in the future by opening new stores in underserved markets and strategically increasing our presence in our existing markets via new store openings and store expansions expansions include store relocations in fiscal 2015  and beyond we plan to predominantly open dollar tree stores that are approximately 8000  10000  selling square feet and we believe this size allows us to achieve our objectives in the markets in which we plan to expand at january 31 2015  approximately 2974  of our stores totaling 65  of our selling square footage were 8000 selling square feet or larger  

our deals stores which offer an expanded assortment of merchandise including items that sell for more than 100 provide us an opportunity to leverage our dollar tree infrastructure in different merchandise concepts including higher price points without disrupting the singleprice point model in our dollar tree stores we operated 219  deals stores as of january 31 2015  

in addition to new store openings we plan to continue our store expansion program to increase our net sales per store and take advantage of market opportunities we target stores for expansion based on the current sales per selling square foot and changes in market opportunities stores targeted for expansion are generally less than 6000  selling square feet in size store expansions generally increase the existing store size by approximately 2750  selling square feet 

since 1995 we have added a total of 695  stores through several mergers and acquisitions our acquisition strategy has been to target companies that have a similar singleprice point concept that have shown success in operations or companies that provide a strategic advantage we evaluate potential acquisition opportunities as they become available on july 27 2014 we executed an agreement and plan of merger to acquire family dollar stores inc for more information regarding the pending acquisition see family dollar acquisition below and item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 11  pending acquisition and related debt beginning on page 61 of this form 10k 

from time to time we also acquire the rights to store leases through bankruptcy or other proceedings we will continue to take advantage of these opportunities as they arise depending upon several factors including their fit within our location and selling square footage size parameters 

merchandising and distribution expanding our customer base is important to our growth plans we plan to continue to stock our new stores with a compelling mix of everchanging merchandise that our customers have come to appreciate consumable merchandise typically leads to more frequent return trips to our stores resulting in increased sales the presentation and display of merchandise in our stores are critical to communicating value to our customers and creating a more exciting shopping experience we believe our approach to visual merchandising results in higher sales volume and an environment that encourages impulse purchases 

a strong and efficient distribution network is critical to our ability to grow and to maintain a lowcost operating structure in 2014 we expanded our joliet illinois distribution center to 15 million square feet in 2013 we completed construction on a new 10 million square foot distribution center in windsor connecticut which began shipping merchandise in june 2013 and expanded our marietta oklahoma distribution center to 10 million square feet in addition we leased an additional 04 million square feet at our san bernardino california distribution center in 2013 we believe our distribution center network is currently capable of supporting approximately 105 billion  in annual sales in the united states new distribution sites are strategically located to reduce stem miles maintain flexibility and improve efficiency in our store service areas we also are a party to an agreement which provides distribution services from two facilities in canada 

our stores receive approximately 90  of their inventory from our distribution centers via contract carriers the remaining store inventory primarily perishable consumable items and other vendormaintained display items are delivered directly to our stores from vendors for more information on our distribution center network see item 2 “properties” beginning on page 19 of this form 10k 

family dollar acquisition 

dollar trees proposed acquisition the acquisition of family dollar stores inc was approved by the family dollar shareholders on january 22 2015 we believe that the combined company will benefit from the following competitive strengths 

size and scale upon consummation of the acquisition we will become one of the largest retailers in north america with approximately 13000 stores in operation across 48 states the district of columbia and five canadian provinces by banner our store base and infrastructure will include dollar tree’s approximately 5300 stores including over 200 deals stores and 10 distribution centers and family dollar’s over 8100 stores and 11 distribution centers subject to adjustment for any stores that are divested in connection with the acquisition dollar tree has not yet reached an agreement with the federal trade commission ‘‘ftc’’ regarding the number of stores that it will be required to divest but continues to believe that it will need to divest no more than roughly 300 stores although the actual number of divestitures may be above or below 300 as the number of divestitures that the ftc will require remains subject to uncertainties 

complementary business models across fixed and multiprice points dollar tree is the nation’s leading operator of fixedprice point stores selling everything for 1 or less and family dollar is a leading national operator of multiprice point stores selling the majority of its products at 10 or less following the acquisition we will create a diversified and complementary business model across both fixedprice and multiprice points which will allow us to offer our customers a broader assortment of compelling fresh and fun merchandise at incredible values 

targets broad range of customers and geographies dollar tree targets customers within a broad range of middle america with stores located primarily in suburban areas while family dollar targets low and lowermiddle income households through its urban and rural locations we plan to operate and grow both banners the dollar tree and family dollar store concepts are complementary and colocate successfully in the same market with little cannibalization consequently following the acquisition we believe we will be able to significantly extend our reach to a broader base of customers and serve them with even greater value choice and convenience 

complementary product offering providing a broad compelling and fresh merchandise assortment at incredible values upon the consummation of the acquisition we will be able to leverage our complementary merchandise assortments across dollar tree and family dollar stores to deliver a broad compelling and fresh product offering to our customers dollar tree’s assortment consists of consumable merchandise 49 variety merchandise 47 and seasonal merchandise 4 while family dollar’s assortment consists of consumable merchandise 73 home products 10 seasonal and electronics 10 and apparel and accessories 7 these complementary assortments will enable the combined company to leverage dollar trees variety and seasonal expertise and family dollars consumables expertise across both store banners and enhance the overall quality of our combined business’s merchandise offering 

stable and recession resilient business we believe that the retail segment in which we operate is a stable and recession resilient industry that grows through various economic cycles and experiences less volatility relative to other retail segments 

dollar tree has achieved consistent growth in net sales over each of the last 10 years and has successfully delivered positive same stores sales for 28 consecutive quarters through varying economic environments following the 2008 recession dollar tree and family dollar stores have become a more frequent shopping channel for consumers who are increasingly price and value conscious we believe that this industry backdrop coupled with our diversified geographic footprint and merchandise offering positions us well to generate stable consistent demand going forward through various economic cycles 

strong free cash flow generation to support planned debt repayment we have always been prudent with our use of capital and following consummation of the acquisition we intend to maintain our disciplined approach to capital deployment to invest in new store growth while supporting our existing infrastructure and store efficiency initiatives our business model offers a highly profitable and capital efficient platform with new stores requiring relatively minimal investment while delivering robust operating income margins and initial investment payback within only a few years we believe we will be able to share our best practices in capital deployment and store development across our combined platform to generate significant excess cash flow going forward and enable rapid debt repayment with the goal of returning to an investment grade rating profile within approximately five years 

best in class management team with proven track record our management team includes experienced longstanding members of the dollar tree family with a consistent track record of delivering industry leading profitability and returns on capital over the last 10 years led by chief executive officer bob sasser our management team is responsible for our financial outperformance over the past decade together with the family dollar team we intend to leverage our management expertise across a larger retail network in an effort to achieve higher levels of sales and profitability 

competition 

our segment of the retail industry is highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future we operate in the discount retail business which is currently and is expected to continue to be highly competitive with respect to price store location merchandise quality assortment and presentation and customer service our competitors include singleprice dollar stores multiprice dollar stores mass merchandisers discount retailers drug stores convenience stores independently operated discount stores and a wide variety of other retailers in addition several competitors have sections within their stores devoted to one dollar price point merchandise which further increases competition we believe we differentiate ourselves from other retailers by providing high value high quality low cost merchandise in attractively designed stores that are conveniently located our sales and profits could be reduced by increases in competition there are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector 

trademarks 

we are the owners of several federal service mark registrations including dollar tree the dollar tree logo the dollar tree logo with a “1” and one priceone dollar in addition we own a concurrent use registration for dollar bill and the related logo we also acquired the rights to use trade names previously owned by everythings a dollar a former competitor in the 100 price point industry several trade names were included in the purchase including the marks everythings 100 we mean everything and everythings 100 with the acquisition of deals we became the owners of the trademark deal” with the acquisition of dollar giant we became the owners of the trademark “dollar giant” and others in canada   we have federal trademark registrations for a variety of private labels that we use to market some of our product lines our trademark registrations have various expiration dates however assuming that the trademark registrations are properly renewed they have a perpetual duration 

employees 

we employed approximately 18100  fulltime and 71900  parttime associates on january 31 2015  parttime associates work an average of less than 30 hours per week the number of parttime associates fluctuates depending on seasonal needs we consider our relationship with our associates to be good and we have not experienced significant interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements 




 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk any failure to meet market expectations including our comparable store sales growth rate earnings and earnings per share or new store openings could cause the market price of our stock to decline you should carefully consider the specific risk factors listed below together with all other information included or incorporated in this report any of the following risks may materialize and additional risks not known to us or that we now deem immaterial may arise in such event our business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected 

our profitability is vulnerable to cost increases 

future increases in costs such as the cost of merchandise wage and benefit costs shipping rates freight costs fuel costs and store occupancy costs may reduce our profitability the minimum wage has increased or is scheduled to increase in multiple states and local jurisdictions and there is a possibility that congress will increase the federal minimum wage we do not raise the sales price of our merchandise to offset cost increases because we are committed to selling primarily at the 100 price point to continue to provide value to the customer we are dependent on our ability to adjust our product assortment to operate more efficiently or to increase our comparable store net sales in order to offset inflation or other cost increases we can give no assurance that we will be able to operate more efficiently or increase our comparable store net sales in the future please see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” beginning on page 25 of this form 10k for further discussion of the effect of inflation and other economic factors on our operations 

a downturn in economic conditions could impact our sales 

deterioration in economic conditions such as those caused by a recession inflation higher unemployment consumer debt levels lack of available credit cost increases as well as adverse weather conditions or terrorism could reduce consumer spending or cause customers to shift their spending to products we either do not sell or do not sell as profitably adverse economic conditions could disrupt consumer spending and significantly reduce our sales decrease our inventory turnover cause greater markdowns or reduce our profitability due to lower margins 

a significant disruption in our computer and technology systems could adversely affect our results of operation or business 

we rely extensively on our computer and technology systems to manage inventory process credit card and customer transactions and summarize results systems may be subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunication failures computer viruses security breaches and catastrophic events if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process customer transactions and may receive negative publicity which could adversely affect our results of operation or business 

if we are unable to secure our customers’ credit card and confidential information or other private data relating to our associates suppliers or our business we could be subject to negative publicity costly government enforcement actions or private litigation which could damage our business reputation and adversely affect our results of operation or business 

we have procedures and technology in place to safeguard our customers’ debit and credit card information our associates’ private data suppliers’ data and our business records and intellectual property despite these measures criminals are constantly devising schemes to circumvent safeguards and we may be vulnerable to and unable to detect and appropriately respond to data security breaches and data loss including cybersecurity attacks other sophisticated retailers have recently suffered serious security breaches if we experience a data security breach we could be exposed to negative publicity government enforcement actions private litigation or costly response measures in addition our reputation within the business community and with our customers may be affected which could result in our customers discontinuing the use of debit or credit cards in our stores or not shopping in our stores altogether this could have an adverse effect on our results of operation or business 

our growth is dependent on our ability to increase sales in existing stores and to expand our square footage profitably 

existing store sales growth is dependent on a variety of factors including merchandise selection and availability store operations and customer satisfaction in addition competition could affect our sales our highest sales periods are the christmas and easter seasons and we generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and our operating and net income during the fourth quarter in anticipation we stock extra inventory and hire many temporary employees to prepare our stores a reduction in sales during these periods could adversely affect our operating results particularly operating and net income to a greater extent than if a reduction occurred at other times of the year untimely merchandise delays due to receiving or distribution problems could have a similar effect easter was observed on march 31 2013 april 20 2014 and will be observed on april 5 2015 

expanding our square footage profitably depends on a number of uncertainties including our ability to locate lease build out and open or expand stores in suitable locations on a timely basis under favorable economic terms in addition our expansion is dependent upon thirdparty developers’ abilities to acquire land obtain financing and secure necessary permits 

and approvals it remains difficult for third party developers to obtain financing for new projects due to the recent turmoil in the financial markets we also open or expand stores within our established geographic markets where new or expanded stores may draw sales away from our existing stores we may not manage our expansion effectively and our failure to achieve our expansion plans could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks associated with our domestic and foreign suppliers from whom our products are sourced could affect our financial performance 

we are dependent on our vendors to supply merchandise in a timely and efficient manner if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments due to financial or other difficulties we could experience merchandise shortages which could lead to lost sales or increased merchandise costs if alternative sources must be used 

merchandise imported directly accounts for approximately 39 to 41 of our total retail value purchases in addition we believe that a portion of our goods purchased from domestic vendors is imported china is the source of a substantial majority of our imports imported goods are generally less expensive than domestic goods and increase our profit margins a disruption in the flow of our imported merchandise or an increase in the cost of those goods may significantly decrease our profits risks associated with our reliance on imported goods may include disruptions in the flow of or increases in the cost of imported goods because of factors such as 

 

we could encounter disruptions in our distribution network or additional costs in distributing merchandise 

our success is dependent on our ability to transport merchandise to our distribution centers and then ship it to our stores in a timely and costeffective manner we may not anticipate respond to or control all of the challenges of operating our receiving and distribution systems additionally if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments we could experience merchandise shortages that could lead to lost sales or increased costs some of the factors that could have an adverse effect on our distribution network or costs are 

 

our profitability is affected by the mix of products we sell 

our gross profit margin could decrease if we increase the proportion of higher cost goods we sell in the future in recent years the percentage of our sales from higher cost consumable products has increased and we can give no assurance that this trend will not continue as a result our gross profit margin could decrease unless we are able to maintain our current merchandise cost sufficiently to offset any decrease in our product margin percentage we can give no assurance that we will be able to do so 

pressure from competitors may reduce our sales and profits 

the retail industry is highly competitive the marketplace is highly fragmented as many different retailers compete for market share by utilizing a variety of store formats and merchandising strategies we expect competition to increase in the 

future there are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector some of our current or potential competitors have greater financial resources than we do we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors please see item 1 “business” beginning on page 6 of this form 10k for further discussion of the effect of competition on our operations 

litigation may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to the risk of litigation involving employees consumers suppliers competitors shareholders government agencies or others through private actions class actions governmental investigations administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation our products could also cause illness or injury harm our reputation and subject us to litigation we are currently defendants in several employmentrelated class and collective actions litigation concerning leases several occupational safety proceedings and a governmental investigation concerning retail hazardous waste the outcome of litigation is difficult to assess or quantify plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss may remain unknown for substantial periods of time in addition certain of these matters if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in an expense that may be material to our financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operation are required the cost to defend current and future litigation may be significant there also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation including litigation related to product safety customer information and environmental or safety requirements which could negatively affect customer perception of our business regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable 

for a discussion of current legal matters please see item 3 “legal proceedings” beginning on page 20 of this form 10k and item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data note 4 commitments and contingencies” under the caption “contingencies” beginning on page 51 of this form 10k resolution of these matters if decided against the company could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations accrued liabilities or cash flows 

changes in federal state or local law or our failure to comply with such laws could increase our expenses and expose us to legal risks 

our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations significant legislative changes such as the healthcare legislation that impact our relationship with our workforce could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations the minimum wage has increased or is scheduled to increase in multiple states and local jurisdictions and there is a possibility that congress will increase the federal minimum wage changes in other regulatory areas such as consumer credit privacy and information security product safety worker safety or environmental protection among others could cause our expenses to increase in addition if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations particularly wage and hour laws we could be subject to legal risk including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation which could adversely affect our results of operations changes in tax laws the interpretation of existing laws or our failure to sustain our reporting positions on examination could adversely affect our effective tax rate 

our business could be adversely affected if we fail to attract and retain qualified associates and key personnel 

our growth and performance is dependent on the skills experience and contributions of our associates executives and key personnel various factors including overall labor availability wage rates regulatory or legislative impacts and benefit costs could impact the ability to attract and retain qualified associates at our stores distribution centers and corporate office 

certain provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws could delay or discourage a change of control transaction that may be in a shareholder’s best interest 

our articles of incorporation and bylaws currently contain provisions that may delay or discourage a takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider in his best interest these provisions among other things 

 

however we believe that these provisions allow our board of directors to negotiate a higher price in the event of a 

takeover attempt which would be in the best interest of our shareholders 

risks related to the proposed family dollar merger and the business of the combined company 

completion of the proposed merger is subject to the satisfaction of numerous conditions and the proposed merger may not be completed on the proposed terms within the expected timeframe or at all 

each of our and family dollar’s obligation to consummate the proposed merger remains subject to a number of conditions including among others the following as further described in the merger agreement i the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 as amended ‘‘hsr act’’ ii approval of the listing on the nasdaq of our common stock to be issued in the merger iii the absence of an injunction prohibiting the merger iv the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party under the merger agreement subject to the materiality standards set forth in the merger agreement v the performance by the other party of its respective obligations under the merger agreement in all material respects vi delivery of officer certificates by the other party certifying satisfaction of the two preceding conditions and in the case of our obligations to complete the merger the absence of a material adverse effect as described in the merger agreement on family dollar since july 27 2014 

there is no assurance that all of the conditions will be satisfied or that the proposed merger will be completed on the proposed terms within the expected timeframe or at all any delay in completing the proposed merger could cause us not to realize some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve if the merger is successfully completed within its expected timeframe further there can be no assurance that the conditions to the closing of the merger will be satisfied or waived or that the merger will be completed see the risk factor entitled “ failure to complete the merger could negatively impact our stock price and future business and financial results ” below 

in order to complete the proposed merger we and family dollar must make certain governmental filings and obtain certain governmental authorizations and if such filings and authorizations are not made or granted or are granted with conditions completion of the merger may be jeopardized or the anticipated benefits of the proposed merger could be reduced 

although we and family dollar have agreed in the merger agreement to use our reasonable best efforts subject to certain limitations to make certain governmental filings and obtain the required expiration or termination of the waiting period under the hsr act there can be no assurance that the waiting period under the hsr act will expire or be terminated as a condition to granting termination of the waiting period under the hsr act governmental authorities may impose requirements limitations or costs or require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of our business after completion of the merger under the terms of the merger agreement subject to certain exceptions we are required to accept certain conditions and take certain actions imposed by governmental authorities that would apply to or affect our businesses assets or properties or those of family dollar and its subsidiaries there can be no assurance that regulators will not impose conditions terms obligations or restrictions including requiring divestitures and that such conditions terms obligations or restrictions including divestitures will not have the effect of delaying completion of the merger or imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of the combined company following the merger or otherwise adversely affecting our business and results of operations after completion of the proposed merger in addition we can provide no assurance that these conditions terms obligations or restrictions will not result in the delay or abandonment of the proposed merger there can also be no assurance that regulators will not seek to challenge the merger 

we and family dollar each submitted a filing under the hsr act on august 8 2014 and each received a second request from the ftc regarding the acquisition on september 8 2014 we and family dollar certified substantial compliance with the second request on november 7 2014 and october 21 2014 respectively the hsr act waiting period has been extended by a timing agreement among the parties and the ftc and we and family dollar have agreed to provide the ftc with four weeks’ notice prior to closing we expect to initiate the 4week notice period which may be terminated early by the ftc after we execute a consent decree with the ftc 

as of march 10 2015 the ftc has identified approximately 250 stores for divestiture representing approximately 34 million of operating income we expect the ftc to substantially complete its review of all remaining stores in the near future we continue to estimate that no more than roughly 300 stores will be required to be divested although we can give no assurance as to the exact number and it could be more or less than 300 in parallel we have made good progress with divestiture buyers and have received multiple indications of interest from buyers each of whom intend to operate these divested locations as dollar stores to address the ftcs concerns we will work to secure ftc approval and finalize divestiture agreements with the selected bidders as soon as practical we are working to close the proposed merger as early as april 2015 but it is uncertain whether the ftc will approve the transaction by that date 

combining the two companies may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits synergies and cost savings of the proposed merger may not be realized including as a result of the challenges family dollar has been recently experiencing as a standalone company 

we and family dollar have operated and until the completion of the proposed merger will continue to operate independently the success of the proposed merger including anticipated benefits synergies and cost savings will depend in part on our ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses of our company and family dollar it is possible that the pendency of the merger andor the integration process could result in the loss of key employees higher than expected costs litigation relating to the proposed merger diversion of management attention of both dollar tree and family dollar increased competition the disruption of either company’s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect the combined company’s ability to maintain relationships with customers vendors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the proposed merger if we experience difficulties with the integration process the anticipated benefits of the proposed merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected family dollar’s first quarter of fiscal year 2015 experienced increased pressures on merchandise margin deleveraging of expenses and increased professional fees and such conditions may continue in fiscal 2015 moreover family dollar has recently experienced turnover in its corporate office and may continue to do so during the pendency of the proposed merger andor integration process each of these factors among others could negatively impact the actual benefits realized in the merger furthermore integration efforts between the two companies will also divert management attention and resources these integration matters could have an adverse effect on us during this transition period and for an undetermined period after completion of the merger on the combined company in addition the actual cost savings of the proposed merger could be less than anticipated 

failure to complete the proposed merger could negatively impact our stock price and our future business and financial results 

if the proposed family dollar merger is not completed for any reason we would be subject to a number of risks including the following 

 

if the proposed merger is not completed these risks may materialize and could have a material adverse effect on our stock price business and cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

we will incur significant transaction and acquisitionrelated costs in connection with the proposed merger 

we expect to incur a number of nonrecurring costs associated with the proposed merger and combining the operations of the two companies the substantial majority of nonrecurring expenses will be comprised of transaction and regulatory costs related to the merger 

we also will incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employmentrelated costs we continue to assess the magnitude of these costs and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the proposed merger and the integration of the two companies’ businesses although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses should allow us to offset integrationrelated costs over time this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all see the risk factor entitled “ combining the two companies may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits synergies and cost savings of the proposed merger may not be realized including as a result of the challenges family dollar has been recently experiencing as a standalone company ” above 

lawsuits have been filed against family dollar its directors dollar tree and one of dollar trees subsidiaries challenging the proposed merger and an adverse ruling in such lawsuits may prevent the proposed merger from becoming effective or from becoming effective within the expected timeframe 

family dollar its directors dollar tree and one of dollar trees subsidiaries are named as defendants in three putative class action lawsuits which have been consolidated under the caption in re family dollar stores inc stockholder litig  ca no 9985 cb brought by purported family dollar shareholders challenging the proposed merger seeking among other things to enjoin consummation of the proposed merger the parties conducted certain document discovery and depositions relating to the motion for a preliminary injunction and a hearing was held on december 5 2014 on december 19 2014 the court of chancery issued an opinion and order denying plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction motion the plaintiffs sought from the court of chancery certification of an interlocutory appeal of that order to the delaware supreme court but on january 2 2015 the court of chancery denied that request no schedule has yet been set for the adjudication of the plaintiffs’ remaining claims for relief if the plaintiffs are successful in their remaining claims there could be an adverse effect on our and family dollar’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the notes 

our consolidated indebtedness as of january 31 2015 was 757 million following the proposed merger we will have substantially increased our indebtedness which could adversely affect our ability to fulfill our obligations and have a negative impact on our financing options and liquidity position upon completion of the proposed merger we expect to have indebtedness of approximately 8507 million and availability under our new revolving credit facility of approximately 1250 million less amounts outstanding for letters of credit 

our high level of debt could have significant consequences including the following 

 

in addition our credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and accordingly our cost of capital our ratings reflect the opinions of the ratings agencies of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations there can be no assurance that we will achieve a particular rating or maintain a particular rating in the future 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to fund our daytoday operations or to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations and other cash requirements we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to sell assets or operations seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to effect any such alternative measures if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful such alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations upon consummation of the proposed merger the agreements that will govern the indebtedness to be incurred or assumed in connection with the proposed merger are expected to restrict a our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from any such dispositions and b our ability to raise debt capital to be used to repay our indebtedness when it becomes due we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to 

obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our obligations 

if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default and as a result holders of the notes and lenders under any of our existing and future indebtedness could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable the lenders under the credit facilities could terminate their commitments to loan money our secured lenders could foreclose against the assets securing such borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation in each case which could result in your losing your investment 

despite current and anticipated indebtedness levels we may still be able to incur substantially more debt this could further exacerbate the risks described above 

we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future although the agreements that will govern the indebtedness to be incurred or assumed in connection with the proposed merger are expected to restrict the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are and will be subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial if new debt is added to our current debt levels the related risks that we now face could intensify upon completion of the pending acquisition we expect to have approximately 1250 million of availability under our new revolving credit facility 

the terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness upon consummation of the proposed merger may restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to pursue our business strategies and could adversely affect our capital resources financial condition and liquidity 

the agreements that will govern the indebtedness to be incurred or assumed in connection with the proposed merger are expected to contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interests including among other things restrictions on our ability to 

 

in addition certain of these agreements are expected to require us to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants our ability to satisfy these financial maintenance covenants can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot assure you that we will meet them 

a breach of the covenants under these agreements could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness which if not cured or waived could result in us having to repay our borrowings before their due dates such default may allow the debt holders to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies if we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or if we were to experience difficulty in refinancing the debt prior to maturity our results of operations or financial condition could be materially affected in addition an event of default under our credit facilities may permit the lenders under our credit facilities to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under such credit facilities furthermore if we are unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our credit facilities those lenders may be able to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness in the event our lenders or holders of notes accelerate the repayment of such borrowings we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay such indebtedness 

as a result of these restrictions we may be 

 

our variablerate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our annual debt service obligations to increase significantly 

certain of our indebtedness including borrowings under our new revolving credit facility and our existing credit facility is or is expected to be subject to variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income would decrease an increase decrease of 025 on the estimated interest rate on debt to finance the proposed merger would result in an increase decrease of 205 million in annual interest expense although we may enter into interest rate swaps involving the exchange of floating for fixedrate interest payments to reduce interest rate volatility we cannot assure you we will be able to do so 

the proposed merger may not be accretive and may be dilutive to our earnings per share which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

because shares of our common stock would be issued in the proposed merger it is possible that the merger will be dilutive to our earnings per share which could negatively affect the market price of shares of our common stock 

in connection with the completion of the proposed merger based on the number of issued and outstanding shares of our common stock and family dollar common stock as of january 31 2015 we would issue approximately 285 million shares of our common stock the issuance of these new shares of our common stock could have the effect of depressing the market price of shares of our common stock through dilution of earnings per share or otherwise 

  

in addition future events and conditions could increase the dilution that is currently projected including adverse changes in market conditions additional transaction and integration related costs and other factors such as the failure to realize some or all of the benefits anticipated in the merger any dilution of or delay of any accretion to our earnings per share could cause the price of shares of our common stock to decline or grow at a reduced rate 

sales of shares of our common stock before and after the completion of the proposed family dollar merger may cause the market price of our common stock to fall 

  

based on the number of outstanding shares of our common stock and family dollar common stock as of january 31 2015 we would issue approximately 285 million shares of our common stock in connection with the proposed family dollar merger the issuance of these new shares of our common stock could have the effect of depressing the market price for our common stock 

  

in addition many family dollar stockholders may decide not to hold the shares of our common stock they will receive in the proposed merger other family dollar stockholders such as funds with limitations on their permitted holdings of stock in individual issuers may be required to sell the shares of our common stock that they receive in the proposed merger such sales of our common stock could have the effect of depressing the market price for our common stock and may take place promptly following consummation of the proposed merger

 item 2 properties 

stores 

as of january 31 2015  we operated 5367  stores in 48 states and the district of columbia and five canadian provinces as detailed below 



we lease the vast majority of our stores and expect to lease the majority of our new stores as we expand our leases typically provide for a short initial lease term generally five years with options to extend however in some cases we have initial lease terms of seven to ten years we believe this leasing strategy enhances our flexibility to pursue various expansion opportunities resulting from changing market conditions as current leases expire we believe that we will be able to obtain lease renewals if desired for present store locations or to obtain leases for equivalent or better locations in the same general area

key events and recent developments 

several key events have had or are expected to have a significant effect on our operations you should keep in mind that 

 

overview 

our net sales are derived from the sale of merchandise two major factors tend to affect our net sales trends first is our success at opening new stores or adding new stores through acquisitions second sales vary at our existing stores from one year to the next we refer to this change as a change in comparable store net sales because we compare only those stores that are open throughout both of the periods being compared we include sales from stores expanded during the year in the calculation of comparable store net sales which has the effect of increasing our comparable store net sales the term expanded also includes stores that are relocated 

at january 31 2015  we operated 5367 stores in 48 states and the district of columbia and five canadian provinces with 465 million selling square feet compared to 4992 stores with 432 million selling square feet at february 1 2014  during fiscal 2014  we opened 391 stores expanded 72 stores and closed 16 stores compared to 343 new stores opened 71 stores expanded and 22 stores closed during fiscal 2013  in the current year we increased our selling square footage by 74 of the 32 million selling square foot increase in 2014  02 million was added by expanding existing stores the average size of our stores opened in 2014  was approximately 8060 selling square feet or about 10000 gross square feet for 2015  we continue to plan to open stores that are approximately 8000  10000 selling square feet or about 10000  12000 gross square feet we believe that this store size is our optimal size operationally and that this size also gives our customers an ideal shopping environment that invites them to shop longer and buy more 

fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 which ended on january 31 2015 and february 1 2014 respectively each included 52 weeks fiscal 2012 ended on february 2 2013 and included 53 weeks commensurate with the retail calendar the 53rd week in 2012 added approximately 125 million in sales 

in fiscal 2014  comparable store net sales increased by 43 the comparable store net sales increase was the result of a 34 increase in the number of transactions and a 09 increase in average ticket we believe comparable store net sales continued to be positively affected by a number of our initiatives as debit and credit card penetration continued to increase in 2014  and we continued the rollout of frozen and refrigerated merchandise to more of our stores at january 31 2015  we had frozen and refrigerated merchandise in approximately 3620 stores compared to approximately 3160 stores at february 1 2014  we believe that the addition of frozen and refrigerated product enables us to increase sales and earnings by increasing the number of shopping trips made by our customers in addition we accept food stamps under the supplemental nutrition assistance program “snap” in approximately 5000 qualified stores compared to 4620 at the end of 2013  

our pointofsale technology provides us with valuable sales and inventory information to assist our buyers and improve our merchandise allocation to our stores we believe that this has enabled us to better manage our inventory flow resulting in more efficient distribution and store operations 

we must continue to control our merchandise costs inventory levels and our general and administrative expenses as increases in these line items could negatively impact our operating results 

pending acquisition 

on july 27 2014 we executed an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement to acquire family dollar in a cash and stock transaction the “acquisition” under the acquisition which was approved by family dollar shareholders on january 22 2015 the family dollar shareholders will receive 5960 in cash plus no more than 03036 and no less than 02484 shares of our common stock for each share of family dollar common stock they own on january 31 2015 family dollar had approximately 1145 million outstanding shares of common stock due to the vesting of outstanding equity awards family dollar is expected to have up to an additional 20 million shares of common stock outstanding at closing in connection with the acquisition family dollar stock options and rsus will convert into options and rsus in our common stock after the acquisition we expect that former family dollar stockholders will own no more than 151 and no less than 127 of the outstanding shares of dollar tree common stock 

the transaction is subject to expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act hsr act and satisfaction or waiver of the other customary closing conditions 

on or before closing we expect to incur approximately 2100 million in acquisitionrelated expenses of which 752 million were incurred in 2014 including 335 million that was paid in 2014 during 2014 285 million of acquisitionrelated expenses were recorded in selling general and administrative expenses and 467 million related to commitment fees were recorded in interest expense net we expect to incur an additional 226 million in commitment fees in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 we also expect to expend approximately 1740 million in capitalizable debt issuance costs related to the financing of the acquisition 

in connection with the acquisition we expect to pay off most of our and family dollars existing debt and obtain approximately 95 billion in bank and bond financing to recapitalize the combined company and finance the acquisition and ongoing operations on february 23 2015 we completed the offering of 325 billion of acquisition notes and on march 9 2015 we received funding under the 395 billion term loan b in connection with the financing the proceeds of the acquisition notes and term loan b are being held in escrow pending consummation of the acquisition please see note 11  pending acquisition and related debt beginning on page 61 of this form 10k included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for more information on the financing 

we expect to achieve approximately 300 million in annual cost savings synergies by the end of the third year after closing and that we will incur 300 million in onetime costs to achieve those synergies we project that the acquisition will be dilutive to earnings per share in the first twelve months following closing on a gaap basis however we expect it will be accretive excluding the onetime costs to achieve synergies 

results of operations 



fiscal year ended january 31 2015  compared to fiscal year ended february 1 2014   

net sales  net sales increased 97 or 7619 million in 2014 compared to 2013 resulting from sales in our new stores and a 43 increase in comparable store net sales comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores which we include in the calculation and to a lesser extent are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing ones 

the following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store count for fiscal years ended january 31 2015  and february 1 2014  



of the 32 million selling square foot increase in 2014  approximately 02 million was added by expanding existing stores 

gross profit   gross profit margin was 353 in 2014 compared to 356 in 2013 due to increased freight costs partially offset by leverage in occupancy costs from the higher comparable store sales increase 

selling general and administrative expenses  selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales remained at 232 for 2014 compared to 2013 excluding 285 million or approximately 35 basis points of expenses related to the family dollar acquisition the selling general and administrative rate was 229 the decrease is primarily due to lower store payroll health insurance and workers compensation costs 

operating income  operating income margin was 121 in 2014 compared to 124 in 2013 excluding the approximately 35 basis points of acquisitionrelated expenses operating income margin was 124 in 2014 as lower selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were offset by lower gross profit margin for the reasons noted above 

interest expense net interest expense net increased 647 million due to 467 million of commitment fees related to the financing of the family dollar acquisition and a full year of interest expense on the 7500 million of senior notes issued in september 2013 

other income expense net  other income expense net in 2014 increased 56 million primarily due to unfavorable fair market value adjustments for our diesel fuel hedges 

income taxes  our effective tax rate was 372 in 2014 compared to 375 in 2013 the rate decrease is the result of lower state tax rates and additional work opportunity tax credits in 2014 

fiscal year ended february 1 2014  compared to fiscal year ended february 2 2013   

net sales  net sales increased 60 or 4458 million in 2013 compared to 2012 resulting from sales in our new stores and a 24 increase in comparable store net sales excluding the 53rd week in 2012 which accounted for approximately 1250 million of sales net sales increased 79 or 5708 million the comparable store net sales increase is based on the comparable 52 weeks for both years comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores which we include in the calculation and to a lesser extent are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing ones 

the following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store count for fiscal years ended february 1 2014  and february 2 2013  



of the 27 million selling square foot increase in 2013 approximately 02 million was added by expanding existing stores 

  gross profit   gross profit margin was 356 in 2013 compared to 359 in 2012 due to loss of leverage in occupancy and distribution cost from the 53rd week of sales in 2012 

selling general and administrative expenses  selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 232 for 2013 compared to 235 for 2012 the decrease is primarily due to lower incentive compensation achievement in 2013 compared with 2012 and lower inventory service fees 

operating income  operating income margin was 124 in 2013 and 2012 due to the reasons noted above 

other income expense net  other income expense net in 2012 includes a 608 million gain on the sale of our investment in ollies holdings inc 

income taxes  our effective tax rate was 375 in 2013 compared to 367 in 2012 the rate increase is the result of statute expirations and the settlement of state tax audits in 2012 

liquidity and capital resources 

our business requires capital to build and open new stores expand our distribution network and operate and expand existing stores our working capital requirements for existing stores are seasonal and usually reach their peak in september and october historically we have satisfied our seasonal working capital requirements for existing stores and have funded our store opening and distribution network expansion programs from internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities

the preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates certain of our estimates require a high level of judgment and have the potential to have a material effect on the financial statements if actual results vary significantly   from those estimates following is a discussion of the estimates that we consider critical 

inventory valuation 

as discussed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 1  summary of significant account policies under the caption merchandise inventories beginning on page 44 of this form 10k inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weightedaverage basis cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weightedaverage basis under the retail inventory method the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated costtoretail ratio to the retail value of inventories the retail inventory method is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis 

inventory valuation methods require certain significant management estimates and judgments including estimates of future merchandise markdowns and shrink which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins the averaging required in applying the retail inventory method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns could under certain circumstances result in costs not being recorded in the proper period 

we estimate our markdown reserve based on the consideration of a variety of factors including but not limited to quantities of slow moving or seasonal carryover merchandise on hand historical markdown statistics and future merchandising plans the accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors some of which are outside of our control including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends historically we have not experienced significant differences in our estimated reserve for markdowns compared with actual results 

our accrual for shrink is based on the actual historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories adjusted if necessary for current economic conditions and business trends these estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger our physical inventory counts are generally taken between january and september of each year therefore the shrink accrual recorded at january 31 2015  is based on estimated shrink for most of 2014  including the fourth quarter we have not experienced significant fluctuations in historical shrink rates beyond approximately 1020 basis points in our dollar tree stores for the last few years however we have sometimes experienced higher than typical shrink in acquired stores in the year following an acquisition we periodically adjust our shrink estimates to address these factors as they become apparent 

our management believes that our application of the retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market each year on a consistent basis 

accrued expenses 

on a monthly basis we estimate certain expenses in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred certain expenses such as legal reserves require a high degree of judgment and our most material estimates include domestic freight expenses selfinsurance costs storelevel operating expenses such as property taxes and utilities and certain other expenses 

we are involved in numerous legal proceedings and claims our accruals if any related to these proceedings and claims are based on a determination of whether or not the loss is both probable and estimable we review outstanding matters with external counsel to assess the probability of an unfavorable outcome and estimates of loss we reevaluate outstanding proceedings and claims each quarter or as new and significant information becomes available and we adjust or establish accruals if necessary our legal proceedings are described in note 4  commitments and contingencies under the caption contingencies beginning on page 51 of this form 10k included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

our freight and storelevel operating expenses are estimated based on current activity and historical trends and results our workers compensation general liability and health insurance accruals are recorded based on actuarial valuations which are adjusted at least annually based on a review performed by a thirdparty actuary for our workers compensation and general liability accruals these actuarial valuations are estimates based on our historical loss development factors for our health insurance accrual the actuary provides an estimate based on historical claims and claim payment timing certain other expenses are estimated and recorded in the periods that management becomes aware of them the related accruals are adjusted as management’s estimates change 

differences in managements estimates and assumptions could result in accruals which are materially different from the calculated accruals our experience has been that some of our estimates are too high and others are too low historically the net total of these differences has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

income taxes 

on a quarterly basis we estimate our required income tax liability and assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets our income taxes payable are estimated based on enacted tax rates including estimated tax rates in states where our store base is growing applied to the income expected to be taxed currently management assesses the recoverability of deferred tax assets based on the availability of carrybacks of future deductible amounts and management’s projections for future taxable income we cannot guarantee that we will generate taxable income in future years historically we have not experienced significant differences in our estimates of our tax accrual 

in addition we have a recorded liability for our estimate of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns judgment is required in evaluating the application of federal and state tax laws including relevant case law and assessing whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination and if so judgment is also required as to the measurement of the amount of tax benefit that will be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or the final outcome differs from the amounts recorded we believe that our liability for uncertain tax positions is adequate for further discussion of our changes in reserves during 2014  see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data  note 3 to the consolidated financial statements” beginning on page 48 of this form 10k 

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations 

we experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales comparable store net sales operating income and net income and expect this trend to continue our results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors including 

 our highest sales periods are the christmas and easter seasons easter was observed on march 31 2013 and on april 20 2014 and will be observed on april 5 2015 we believe that the earlier easter in 2015 could result in a 80 million decrease in sales in the first quarter of 2015 as compared to the first quarter of 2014 we generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and of our operating and net income during the fourth quarter in anticipation of increased sales activity during these months we purchase substantial amounts of inventory and hire a significant number of temporary employees to supplement our continuing store staff our operating results particularly operating and net income could suffer if our net sales were below seasonal norms during the fourth quarter or during the easter season for any reason including merchandise delivery delays due to receiving or distribution problems changes in consumer sentiment or inclement weather 

our unaudited results of operations for the eight most recent quarters are shown in a table in note 12 of the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

inflation and other economic factors 

our ability to provide quality merchandise at a fixed price and on a profitable basis may be subject to economic factors and influences that we cannot control consumer spending could decline because of economic pressures including unemployment and rising fuel prices reductions in consumer confidence and spending could have an adverse effect on our sales national or international events including war or terrorism could lead to disruptions in economies in the united states or in foreign countries these and other factors could increase our merchandise costs fuel costs and other costs that are critical to our operations such as shipping and wage rates 

shipping costs  transpacific shipping rates are negotiated with individual freight lines and are subject to fluctuation based on shipping industry market conditions and fuel costs  we can give no assurances as to the final rate trends for 2015  as we are in the early stages of our negotiations 

minimum wage   multiple states and local jurisdictions passed legislation that increase their minimum wages in 2015 and 2016 and the federal government has made indications that it may consider increasing the federal minimum wage as a result 

we believe our expenses could increase unless we are able to offset the increase in payroll costs by operating more effectively or efficiently 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of our business including the impact of interest rate changes and diesel fuel cost changes we may enter into interest rate or diesel fuel swaps to manage exposure to interest rate and diesel fuel price changes we do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging and we do not hold derivative instruments for trading purposes 

diesel fuel cost risk 

in order to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in diesel fuel costs we entered into fuel derivative contracts with third parties we hedged 16 million  28 million  and 48 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2014  2013  and 2012 respectively these hedges represented approximately 10  20  and 35 of our total domestic truckload fuel needs in 2014  2013  and 2012 respectively we currently have fuel derivate contracts to hedge 66 million gallons of diesel fuel or approximately 40 of our domestic truckload fuel needs from february 2015 through january 2016 under these contracts we pay the third party a fixed price for diesel fuel and receive variable diesel fuel prices at amounts approximating current diesel fuel costs thereby creating the economic equivalent of a fixedrate obligation these derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and therefore all changes in fair value for these derivatives are included in earnings the fair value of these contracts as of january 31 2015  was a liability of 57 million

 item 1 business 

overview 

we are the leading operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise at the fixed price of 100 we believe the variety and value of products we sell for 100 sets us apart from our competitors at february 1 2014  we operated 4992  discount variety retail stores our stores operate under the names of dollar tree deal dollar tree deal dollar tree canada dollar giant and dollar bills in 4778  of these stores we sell substantially all items for 100 or less in the united states and 125cad or less in canada in substantially all of the remaining stores operating as deal we sell items for 100 or less but also sell items for more than 100 

we believe our optimal store size is between 8000  and 10000  selling square feet this store size provides the appropriate amount of space for our broad merchandise offerings while allowing us to provide ease of shopping to our customers as we have been expanding our merchandise offerings we have added freezers and coolers to approximately 3160  stores to increase sales and shopping frequency at january 30 2010  we operated 3806  stores in 48 states at february 1 2014  we operated 4812  stores in 48 states and the district of columbia as well as 180  stores in canada our revenue and assets in canada are not material our selling square footage increased from approximately 323 million  square feet in january 2010  to 432 million  square feet in february 2014  our store growth has resulted primarily from opening new stores and the acquisition of dollar giant 

business strategy 

value merchandise offering  we strive to exceed our customers expectations of the variety and quality of products that they can purchase for 100 by offering items that we believe typically sell for higher prices elsewhere we buy approximately 58  to 60  of our merchandise domestically and import the remaining 40  to 42  our domestic purchases include basic seasonal closeouts and promotional merchandise we believe our mix of imported and domestic merchandise affords our buyers flexibility that allows them to consistently exceed the customers expectations in addition direct relationships with manufacturers permit us to select from a broad range of products and customize packaging product sizes and package quantities that meet our customers needs 

mix of basic variety and seasonal merchandise we maintain a balanced selection of products within traditional variety store categories we offer a wide selection of everyday basic products and we supplement these basic everyday items with seasonal closeout and promotional merchandise we attempt to keep certain basic consumable merchandise in our stores continuously to establish our stores as a destination and we have slightly increased the mix of consumable merchandise in order to increase the traffic in our stores closeout and promotional merchandise is purchased opportunistically and represents less than 10  of our purchases 

our merchandise mix consists of 

 we have added freezers and coolers to certain stores and increased the amount of consumable merchandise carried by those stores we believe this initiative helps drive additional transactions and allows us to appeal to a broader demographic mix we have added freezers and coolers to 610  additional stores in 2013  therefore as of february 1 2014  we have freezers and coolers in 3160  of our stores we plan to add them to 320  more stores in 2014  the following table shows the percentage of net sales of each major product group for the years ended february 1 2014  and february 2 2013  



at any point in time we carry approximately 6700  items in our stores and as of the end of 2013  approximately 35  of our items are automatically replenished the remaining items are pushed to the stores and many can be reordered by our store managers on a weekly basis through automatic replenishment and our store managers’ ability to order product each store manager is able to satisfy the demands of their particular customer base 

customer payment methods all of our stores in the united states accept cash checks debit cards and credit cards  along with the rollout of freezers and coolers we have increased the number of stores accepting electronic benefits transfer ebt cards and food stamps under the supplemental nutrition assistance program “snap” to approximately 4620  stores as of february 1 2014  snap benefits were lowered for recipients after november 1 2013 however we do not expect the effect on our sales to be material 

convenient locations and store size we primarily focus on opening new stores in strip shopping centers anchored by large retailers who draw target customers we believe to be similar to ours our stores have proven successful in metropolitan areas midsized cities and small towns the range of our store sizes allows us to target a particular location with a store that best suits that market and takes advantage of available real estate opportunities our stores are attractively designed and create an inviting atmosphere for shoppers by using bright lighting vibrant colors and decorative signs we enhance the store design with attractive merchandise displays we believe this design attracts new and repeat customers and enhances our image as both a destination and impulse purchase store 

for more information on retail locations and retail store leases see item 2 properties” beginning on page 12 of this form 10k 

profitable stores with strong cash flow we maintain a disciplined costsensitive approach to store site selection in order to minimize the initial capital investment required and maximize our potential to generate high operating margins and strong cash flows we believe that our stores have a relatively small shopping radius which allows us to profitably concentrate multiple stores within a single market our ability to open new stores is dependent upon among other factors locating suitable sites and negotiating favorable lease terms 

the strong cash flows generated by our stores allow us to selffund infrastructure investment and new stores over the past five years cash flows from operating activities have exceeded capital expenditures 

for more information on our results of operations see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” beginning on page 18 of this form 10k 

cost control  we believe that our substantial buying power and our flexibility in making sourcing decisions contributes to our successful purchasing strategy which includes targeted merchandise margin goals by category we also believe our ability to select quality merchandise helps to minimize markdowns we buy products on an orderbyorder basis and have no material longterm purchase contracts or other assurances of continued product supply or guaranteed product cost no vendor accounted for more than 10 of total merchandise purchased in any of the past five years 

our supply chain systems continue to provide us with valuable sales information to assist our buyers and improve merchandise allocation to our stores controlling our inventory levels has resulted in more efficient distribution and store operations 

information systems we believe that investments in technology help us to increase sales and control costs our inventory management system has allowed us to improve the efficiency of our supply chain improve merchandise flow increase inventory turnover and control distribution and store operating costs it is also used to provide information to calculate our estimate of inventory cost under the retail inventory method which is widely used in the retail industry our automatic replenishment system replenishes key items based on actual store level sales and inventory at the end of 2013  approximately 35  of our items are on automatic replenishment 

pointofsale data allows us to track sales and inventory by merchandise category at the store level and assists us in planning for future purchases of inventory we believe that this information allows us to ship the appropriate product to stores at the quantities commensurate with selling patterns using this pointofsale data to plan purchases of inventory has helped us manage our inventory levels 

corporate culture and values we believe that honesty and integrity doing the right things for the right reasons and treating people fairly and with respect are core values within our corporate culture we believe that running a business and certainly a public company carries with it a responsibility to be above reproach when making operational and financial decisions our executive management team visits and shops our stores like every customer and ideas and individual creativity on the part of our associates are encouraged particularly from our store managers who know their stores and their 

customers we have standards for store displays merchandise presentation and store operations we maintain an open door policy for all associates our distribution centers are operated based on objective measures of performance and virtually everyone in our store support center is available to assist associates in the stores and distribution centers 

our disclosure committee meets at least quarterly and monitors our internal controls over financial reporting to ensure that our public filings contain discussions about the risks our business faces we believe that we have the controls in place to be able to certify our financial statements additionally we have complied with the listing requirements for the nasdaq stock market 

seasonality   for information on the impact of seasonality see item 1a risk factors beginning on page 8 of this form 10k and item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations beginning on page 18 of this form 10k 

growth strategy 

store openings and square footage growth the primary factors contributing to our net sales growth have been new store openings an active store expansion and remodel program and selective mergers and acquisitions in the last five years net sales increased at a compound annual growth rate of 106  we expect that the majority of our future sales growth will come primarily from new store openings and from our store expansion and relocation program 

the following table shows the average selling square footage of our stores and the selling square footage per new store opened over the last five years our growth and productivity statistics are reported based on selling square footage because our management believes the use of selling square footage yields a more accurate measure of store productivity 



we expect to increase our selling square footage in the future by opening new stores in underserved markets and strategically increasing our presence in our existing markets via new store openings and store expansions expansions include store relocations in fiscal 2014  and beyond we plan to predominantly open stores that are approximately 8000  10000  selling square feet and we believe this size allows us to achieve our objectives in the markets in which we plan to expand at february 1 2014  approximately 2750  of our stores totaling 65  of our selling square footage were 8000 selling square feet or larger  

we also continue to grow our deal format which offers an expanded assortment of merchandise including items that sell for more than 100 these stores provide us an opportunity to leverage our dollar tree infrastructure in different merchandise concepts including higher price points without disrupting the singleprice point model in our dollar tree stores we operated 214  deal stores as of february 1 2014  

in addition to new store openings we plan to continue our store expansion program to increase our net sales per store and take advantage of market opportunities we target stores for expansion based on the current sales per selling square foot and changes in market opportunities stores targeted for expansion are generally less than 6000  selling square feet in size store expansions generally increase the existing store size by approximately 2750  selling square feet 

since 1995 we have added a total of 695  stores through several mergers and acquisitions our acquisition strategy has been to target companies that have a similar singleprice point concept that have shown success in operations or companies that provide a strategic advantage we evaluate potential acquisition opportunities as they become available 

from time to time we also acquire the rights to store leases through bankruptcy or other proceedings we will continue to take advantage of these opportunities as they arise depending upon several factors including their fit within our location and selling square footage size parameters 

merchandising and distribution expanding our customer base is important to our growth plans we plan to continue to stock our new stores with a compelling mix of everchanging merchandise that our customers have come to 

appreciate consumable merchandise typically leads to more frequent return trips to our stores resulting in increased sales the presentation and display of merchandise in our stores are critical to communicating value to our customers and creating a more exciting shopping experience we believe our approach to visual merchandising results in higher sales volume and an environment that encourages impulse purchases 

a strong and efficient distribution network is critical to our ability to grow and to maintain a lowcost operating structure in 2013 we completed construction on a new 10 million square foot distribution center in windsor connecticut which began shipping merchandise in june 2013 and expanded our marietta oklahoma distribution center to 10 million square feet in addition we leased an additional 04 million square feet at our san bernardino california distribution center in 2013 in 2011 we expanded our savannah georgia distribution center to 10 million square feet we believe our distribution center network is currently capable of supporting approximately 102 billion  in annual sales in the united states new distribution sites are strategically located to reduce stem miles maintain flexibility and improve efficiency in our store service areas we also are a party to an agreement which provides distribution services from two facilities in canada 

our stores receive approximately 90  of their inventory from our distribution centers via contract carriers the remaining store inventory primarily perishable consumable items and other vendormaintained display items are delivered directly to our stores from vendors for more information on our distribution center network see item 2 “properties” beginning on page 12 of this form 10k 

competition 

the retail industry is highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future we operate in the discount retail merchandise business which is currently and is expected to continue to be highly competitive with respect to price store location merchandise quality assortment and presentation and customer service our competitors include singleprice dollar stores multiprice dollar stores mass merchandisers discount retailers and variety retailers in addition several competitors have locations with dollar price point merchandise in their stores which increases competition we believe we differentiate ourselves from other retailers by providing high value high quality low cost merchandise in attractively designed stores that are conveniently located our sales and profits could be reduced by increases in competition there are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector 

trademarks 

we are the owners of several federal service mark registrations including dollar tree the dollar tree logo the dollar tree logo with a “1” and one priceone dollar in addition we own a concurrent use registration for dollar bill and the related logo we also acquired the rights to use trade names previously owned by everythings a dollar a former competitor in the 100 price point industry several trade names were included in the purchase including the marks everythings 100 we mean everything and everythings 100 with the acquisition of deal we became the owners of the trademark deal” with the acquisition of dollar giant we became the owners of the trademark “dollar giant” and others in canada   we have federal trademark registrations for a variety of private labels that we use to market some of our product lines our trademark registrations have various expiration dates however assuming that the trademark registrations are properly renewed they have a perpetual duration 

employees 

we employed approximately 17600  fulltime and 69800  parttime associates on february 1 2014  parttime associates work an average of less than 30 hours per week the number of parttime associates fluctuates depending on seasonal needs we consider our relationship with our associates to be good and we have not experienced significant interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements 




 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk any failure to meet market expectations including our comparable store sales growth rate earnings and earnings per share or new store openings could cause the market price of our stock to decline you should carefully consider the specific risk factors listed below together with all other information included or incorporated in this report any of the following risks may materialize and additional risks not known to us or that we now deem immaterial may arise in such event our business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected 

our profitability is vulnerable to cost increases 

future increase in costs such as the cost of merchandise wage and benefit costs shipping rates freight costs fuel costs and store occupancy costs may reduce our profitability the minimum wage has increased or is scheduled to increase in multiple states and local jurisdictions and there is a possibility that congress will increase the federal minimum wage we do not raise the sales price of our merchandise to offset cost increases because we are committed to selling primarily at the 100 price point 

to continue to provide value to the customer we are dependent on our ability to adjust our product assortment to operate more efficiently or effectively or to increase our comparable store net sales in order to offset inflation or other cost increases we can give no assurance that we will be able to operate more efficiently or increase our comparable store net sales in the future please see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations beginning on page 18 of this form 10k for further discussion of the effect of inflation and other economic factors on our operations 

a downturn in economic conditions could impact our sales 

deterioration in economic conditions such as those caused by a recession inflation higher unemployment consumer debt levels lack of available credit cost increases as well as adverse weather conditions or terrorism could reduce consumer spending or cause customers to shift their spending to products we either do not sell or do not sell as profitably adverse economic conditions could disrupt consumer spending and significantly reduce our sales decrease our inventory turnover cause greater markdowns or reduce our profitability due to lower margins 

litigation may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of   operations 

our business is subject to the risk of litigation involving employees consumers suppliers competitors shareholders government agencies or others through private actions class actions governmental investigations administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation our products could also cause illness or injury harm our reputation and subject us to litigation we are currently defendants in several employmentrelated class and collective actions litigation concerning leases and a governmental investigation concerning retail hazardous waste the outcome of litigation is difficult to assess or quantify plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss may remain unknown for substantial periods of time in addition certain of these matters if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in an expense that may be material to our financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operation are required the cost to defend current and future litigation may be significant there also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation including litigation related to product safety customer information and environmental requirements which could negatively affect customer perception of our business regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable 

for a discussion of current legal matters please see item 3 “legal proceedings” beginning on page 13 of this form 10k and item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 4  commitments and contingencies under the caption contingencies beginning on page 42 to this form 10k resolution of these matters if decided against the company could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations accrued liabilities or cash flows 

a significant disruption in our computer and technology systems could adversely affect our results of operation or business 

we rely extensively on our computer and technology systems to manage inventory process credit card and customer transactions and summarize results systems may be subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunication failures computer viruses security breaches and catastrophic events if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process customer transactions and may receive negative publicity which could adversely affect our results of operation or business 

if we are unable to secure our customers credit card and confidential information or other private data relating to our associates suppliers or our business we could be subject to negative publicity costly government enforcement actions or private litigation which could damage our business reputation and adversely affect our results of operation or business 

we have procedures and technology in place to safeguard our customers debit and credit card information our associates private data suppliers data and our business records and intellectual property despite these measures criminals are constantly devising schemes to circumvent safeguards and we may be vulnerable to and unable to detect and appropriately respond to data security breaches and data loss including cybersecurity attacks other sophisticated retailers have recently suffered serious security breaches if we experience a data security breach we could be exposed to negative publicity government enforcement actions private litigation or costly response measures in addition our reputation within the business community and with our customers may be affected which could result in our customers discontinuing the use of debit or credit cards in our stores or not shopping in our stores altogether this could could have an adverse effect on our results of operation or business 

changes in federal state or local law or our failure to comply with such laws could increase our expenses and expose us to legal risks 

our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations significant legislative changes such as the healthcare legislation that impact our relationship with our workforce could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations the minimum wage has increased or is scheduled to increase in multiple states and local jurisdictions and there is a possibility that congress will increase the federal minimum wage changes in other regulatory areas such as consumer credit privacy and information security product safety or environmental protection among others could cause our expenses to increase in addition if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations particularly wage and hour laws we could be subject to legal risk including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation which could adversely affect our results of operations changes in tax laws the interpretation of existing laws or our failure to sustain our reporting positions on examination could adversely affect our effective tax rate 

our growth is dependent on our ability to increase sales in existing stores and to expand our square footage profitably 

existing store sales growth is dependent on a variety of factors including merchandise selection and availability store operations and customer satisfaction in addition competition could affect our sales our highest sales periods are the christmas and easter seasons and we generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and our operating and net income during the fourth quarter in anticipation we stock extra inventory and hire many temporary employees to prepare our stores a reduction in sales during these periods could adversely affect our operating results particularly operating and net income to a greater extent than if a reduction occurred at other times of the year untimely merchandise delays due to receiving or distribution problems could have a similar effect easter was observed on april 8 2012  march 31 2013  and will be observed on april 20 2014  

expanding our square footage profitably depends on a number of uncertainties including our ability to locate lease build out and open or expand stores in suitable locations on a timely basis under favorable economic terms in addition our expansion is dependent upon thirdparty developers’ abilities to acquire land obtain financing and secure necessary permits and approvals it remains difficult for third party developers to obtain financing for new projects due to the recent turmoil in the financial markets we also open or expand stores within our established geographic markets where new or expanded stores may draw sales away from our existing stores we may not manage our expansion effectively and our failure to achieve our expansion plans could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks associated with our domestic and foreign suppliers from whom our products are sourced could affect our financial performance 

we are dependent on our vendors to supply merchandise in a timely and efficient manner if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments due to financial or other difficulties we could experience merchandise shortages which could lead to lost sales or increased merchandise costs if alternative sources must be used 

merchandise imported directly accounts for approximately 40  to 42  of our total retail value purchases in addition we believe that a portion of our goods purchased from domestic vendors is imported china is the source of a substantial majority of our imports imported goods are generally less expensive than domestic goods and increase our profit margins a disruption in the flow of our imported merchandise or an increase in the cost of those goods may significantly decrease our profits risks associated with our reliance on imported goods may include disruptions in the flow of or increases in the cost of imported goods because of factors such as 

 we could encounter disruptions in our distribution network or additional costs in distributing merchandise 

our success is dependent on our ability to transport merchandise to our distribution centers and then ship it to our stores in a timely and costeffective manner we may not anticipate respond to or control all of the challenges of operating our receiving and distribution systems additionally if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments we could experience merchandise shortages that could lead to lost sales or increased costs some of the factors that could have an adverse effect on our distribution network or costs are 

 10 

 our profitability is affected by the mix of products we sell 

our gross profit margin could decrease if we increase the proportion of higher cost goods we sell in the future in recent years the percentage of our sales from higher cost consumable products has increased and we can give no assurance that this trend will not continue as a result our gross profit margin could decrease unless we are able to maintain our current merchandise cost sufficiently to offset any decrease in our product margin percentage we can give no assurance that we will be able to do so 

pressure from competitors may reduce our sales and profits 

the retail industry is highly competitive the marketplace is highly fragmented as many different retailers compete for market share by utilizing a variety of store formats and merchandising strategies we expect competition to increase in the future there are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector some of our current or potential competitors have greater financial resources than we do we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors please see item 1 “business” beginning on page 5 of this form 10k for further discussion of the effect of competition on our operations 

our business could be adversely affected if we fail to attract and retain qualified associates and key personnel 

our growth and performance is dependent on the skills experience and contributions of our associates executives and key personnel various factors including overall labor availability wage rates regulatory or legislative impacts and benefit costs could impact the ability to attract and retain qualified associates at our stores distribution centers and corporate office 

failure to comply with our debt covenants could adversely affect our capital resources financial condition and liquidity 

our debt agreements contain certain restrictive covenants which impose various operating and financial restrictions on us our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants in our debt agreements could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in us having to repay our borrowings before their due dates if we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or if we were to experience difficulty in refinancing the debt prior to maturity our results of operations or financial condition could be materially affected 

certain provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws could delay or discourage a takeover attempt that may be in a shareholders best interest   

our articles of incorporation and bylaws currently contain provisions that may delay or discourage a takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider in his best interest these provisions among other things 

 however we believe that these provisions allow our board of directors to negotiate a higher price in the event of a takeover attempt which would be in the best interest of our shareholders

stores 

as of february 1 2014  we operated 4992  stores in 48 states and the district of columbia and five canadian provinces as detailed below 



we lease the vast majority of our stores and expect to lease the majority of our new stores as we expand our leases typically provide for a short initial lease term generally five years with options to extend however in some cases we have initial lease terms of seven to ten years we believe this leasing strategy enhances our flexibility to pursue various expansion opportunities resulting from changing market conditions as current leases expire we believe that we will be able to obtain lease renewals if desired for present store locations or to obtain leases for equivalent or better locations in the same general area

the following table presents our share repurchase activity for the 13 weeks ended february 1 2014  



on september 17 2013 we entered into two 5000 million variable maturity accelerated share repurchase agreements asrs to repurchase 10 billion of our common shares in the aggregate one agreement is collared and the other is uncollared

the number of shares to be received under the uncollared agreement is determined based on the weighted average market price of our common stock less a discount during a calculation period ending on or before june 2014 we received an initial delivery of 72 million shares during fiscal 2013 if the actual number of shares to be repurchased under the agreement exceeds the number of shares initially delivered we will receive the excess shares at the end of the calculation period if the number of shares initially delivered exceeds the actual number of shares to be repurchased we will pay or deliver an amount equal to that excess in either cash or shares at our election on february 14 2014 the uncollared agreement concluded and we received an additional 19 million shares resulting in a total of 91 million shares repurchased under this agreement

key events and recent developments 

several key events have had or are expected to have a significant effect on our operations you should keep in mind that 

 overview 

our net sales are derived from the sale of merchandise two major factors tend to affect our net sales trends first is our success at opening new stores or adding new stores through acquisitions second sales vary at our existing stores from one year to the next we refer to this change as a change in comparable store net sales because we compare only those stores that are open throughout both of the periods being compared we include sales from stores expanded during the year in the calculation of comparable store net sales which has the effect of increasing our comparable store net sales the term expanded also includes stores that are relocated 

at february 1 2014  we operated 4992 stores in 48 states and the district of columbia and five canadian provinces with 432 million selling square feet compared to 4671 stores with 405 million selling square feet at february 2 2013  during fiscal 2013  we opened 343 stores expanded 71 stores and closed 22 stores compared to 345 new stores opened 87 stores expanded and 25 stores closed during fiscal 2012  in the current year we increased our selling square footage by 69 of the 27 million selling square foot increase in 2013  02 million was added by expanding existing stores the average size of our stores opened in 2013  was approximately 8020 selling square feet or about 9800 gross square feet for 2014  we continue to plan to open stores that are approximately 8000  10000 selling square feet or about 10000  12000 gross square feet we believe that this store size is our optimal size operationally and that this size also gives our customers an ideal shopping environment that invites them to shop longer and buy more 

fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2011 which ended on february 1 2014 and january 28 2012 respectively each included 52 weeks fiscal 2012 ended on february 2 2013 and included 53 weeks commensurate with the retail calendar the 53rd week in 2012 added approximately 125 million in sales 

in fiscal 2013  comparable store net sales increased by 24 this increase was based on the comparable 52 weeks for both years the comparable store net sales increase was the result of a 19 increase in the number of transactions and a 05 increase in average ticket we believe comparable store net sales continued to be positively affected by a number of our initiatives as debit and credit card penetration continued to increase in 2013  and we continued the rollout of frozen and refrigerated merchandise to more of our stores at february 1 2014  we had frozen and refrigerated merchandise in approximately 3160 stores compared to approximately 2550 stores at february 2 2013  we believe that the addition of frozen and refrigerated product enables us to increase sales and earnings by increasing the number of shopping trips made by our customers in addition we accept food stamps under the supplemental nutrition assistance program “snap” in approximately 4620 qualified stores compared to 4200 at the end of 2012  snap benefits were lowered for recipients after november 1 2013 however we do not expect the effect on our sales to be material 

our pointofsale technology provides us with valuable sales and inventory information to assist our buyers and improve our merchandise allocation to our stores we believe that this has enabled us to better manage our inventory flow resulting in more efficient distribution and store operations 

we must continue to control our merchandise costs inventory levels and our general and administrative expenses as increases in these line items could negatively impact our operating results 

results of operations 



fiscal year ended february 1 2014  compared to fiscal year ended february 2 2013   

net sales  net sales increased 60 or 4458 million in 2013 compared to 2012 resulting from sales in our new stores and a 24 increase in comparable store net sales excluding the 53rd week in 2012 which accounted for approximately 1250 million of sales net sales increased 79 or 5708 million the comparable store net sales increase is based on the comparable 52 weeks for both years comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores which we include in the calculation and to a lesser extent are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing ones 

the following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store count for fiscal years ended february 1 2014  and february 2 2013  



of the 27 million selling square foot increase in 2013  approximately 02 million was added by expanding existing stores 

gross profit   gross profit margin was 356 in 2013 compared to 359 in 2012 due to loss of leverage in occupancy and distribution cost from the 53rd week of sales in 2012 

selling general and administrative expenses  selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 232 for 2013 compared to 235 for 2012 the decrease is primarily due to lower incentive compensation achievement in 2013 compared with 2012 and lower inventory service fees 

operating income  operating income margin was 124 in 2013 and 2012 due to the reasons noted above 

interest expense net interest expense net increased 129 million due to interest related to the 7500 million of senior notes issued in september 2013 

other income expense net  other income expense net in 2012 includes a 608 million gain on the sale of our investment in ollies holdings inc 

income taxes  our effective tax rate was 375 in 2013 compared to 367 in 2012 the rate increase is the result of statute expirations and the settlement of state tax audits in 2012 

fiscal year ended february 2 2013  compared to fiscal year ended january 28 2012   

net sales  net sales increased 115 or 7640 million in 2012 compared to 2011 resulting from sales in our new stores and the 53rd week in 2012 which accounted for approximately 1250 million of the increase our sales increase was also impacted by a 34 increase in comparable store net sales for the year this increase is based on a 53week comparison for both periods comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores which we include in the calculation and to a lesser extent are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing ones 

the following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store count for fiscal years ended february 2 2013  and january 28 2012  



prior to fiscal 2012 we did not open new stores or expand stores in the month of january of the 345 new stores added in 2012 25 stores were opened and five were expanded in january 2013 of the 29 million selling square foot increase in 2012 approximately 03 million was added by expanding existing stores 

  gross profit   gross profit margin was 359 in 2012 and 2011 improvement in initial markup in many categories and occupancy and distribution cost leverage were offset by an increase in the mix of higher cost consumer product merchandise and higher freight costs in fiscal 2012 than in fiscal 2011 

selling general and administrative expenses  selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 235 for 2012 compared to 241 for 2011 the decrease is primarily due to the following 

 operating income  operating income margin was 124 in 2012 compared to 118 in 2011 due to the reasons noted above operating income margin improved 60 basis points 

other income expense net  other income expense net in 2012 includes a 608 million gain on the sale of our investment in ollies holdings inc 

income taxes  our effective tax rate was 367 in 2012 compared to 374 in 2011 the rate decrease is the result of statute expirations and the settlement of state tax audits 

liquidity and capital resources 

our business requires capital to build and open new stores expand our distribution network and operate and expand existing stores our working capital requirements for existing stores are seasonal and usually reach their peak in september and october historically we have satisfied our seasonal working capital requirements for existing stores and have funded our store opening and distribution network expansion programs from internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities 

the following table compares cashflow related information for the years ended february 1 2014  february 2 2013  and january 28 2012  



net cash provided by operating activities increased 1157 million in 2013 compared to 2012 due to a decrease in cash used for prepaid rent and purchasing merchandise inventory partially offset by a decrease in income taxes payable 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased 88 million in 2012 compared to 2011 due to an increase in cash used to purchase merchandise inventory and cash used for prepaid rent as a result of february 1st falling in the last week of the fiscal year partially offset by increased earnings before income taxes depreciation and amortization in 2012 and increases in income taxes payable

net cash used in investing activities increased 1752 million in 2012 primarily due to the sale of 1808 million of shortterm investments in 2011 versus none in 2012 and a 621 million increase in capital expenditures in 2012 due to the higher number of stores opened compared to 2011 and the construction of our distribution center in connecticut the 623 million in proceeds from the sale of the investment in ollies holdings inc provided cash for investing activities in 2012 

in 2013 net cash used in financing activities increased 2944 million as a result of an increase in share repurchases in 2013 and the repayment of the 2500 million outstanding on the revolving credit facility partially offset by 7500 million of proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes 

in 2012 net cash used in financing activities decreased 3198 million as a result of reduced share repurchases in 2012 

at february 1 2014  our longterm borrowings were 7698 million we also have 1300 million 1000 million and 200 million letter of credit reimbursement and security agreements under which approximately 1441 million were committed to letters of credit issued for routine purchases of imported merchandise at february 1 2014

in june 2012 we entered into a fiveyear 7500 million unsecured credit agreement the agreement the agreement provides for a 7500 million revolving line of credit including up to 1500 million in available letters of credit the interest rate on the agreement is based at our option on a libor rate plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin the agreement also bears a facilities fee calculated as a percentage as defined of the amount available under the line of credit payable quarterly the agreement also bears an administrative fee payable annually the agreement among other things requires the maintenance of certain specified financial ratios restricts the payment of certain distributions and prohibits the incurrence of certain new indebtedness as of february 1 2014  no amount was outstanding under the 7500 million revolving line of credit 

in september 2013 we amended the agreement to enable the issuance of the notes 

we repurchased 174 million shares for 11121 million in fiscal 2013  subsequent to year end we received an additional 19 million shares due to the completion of the uncollared asr we may receive additional shares in 2014 upon completion of

funding requirements 

overview including offbalance sheet arrangements 

we expect our cash needs for opening new stores and expanding existing stores in fiscal 2014  to total approximately 2588   million which includes capital expenditures initial inventory and preopening costs 

our estimated capital expenditures for fiscal 2014  are between 3500 million and 3600 million including planned expenditures for our new and expanded stores the addition of freezers and coolers to approximately 320 stores the expansion of our joliet illinois distribution center and the initial phases of work on our eleventh distribution center we believe that we can adequately fund our working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures for the next few years from net cash provided by operations and potential borrowings under our existing credit facility 

the following tables summarize our material contractual obligations at february 1 2014  including both on and offbalance sheet arrangements and our commitments including interest on longterm borrowings in millions

demand revenue bonds  in may 1998 we entered into an agreement with the mississippi business finance corporation under which it issued 190 million of variablerate demand revenue bonds we used the proceeds from the bonds to finance the acquisition construction and installation of land buildings machinery and equipment for our distribution facility in olive branch mississippi at february 1 2014  the balance outstanding on the bonds was 128 million these bonds are due to be fully repaid in june 2018 the bonds do not have a prepayment penalty as long as the interest rate remains variable the bonds 

contain a demand provision and therefore outstanding amounts are classified as current liabilities we pay interest monthly based on a variable interest rate which was 019 at february 1 2014  

on march 3 2014 we paid the 128 million outstanding under the demand revenue bonds and the debt was retired 

forgivable promissory note   in 2012 we entered into a promissory note with the state of connecticut under which the state loaned us 70 million  in connection with our acquisition construction and installation of land building machinery and equipment for our distribution facility in windsor connecticut if certain performance targets are met the loan and any accrued interest will be forgiven in fiscal 2017 if the performance targets are not met the loan and accrued interest must be repaid over a fiveyear period beginning in fiscal 2017

we also have approximately 129 million of letters of credit outstanding for our selfinsurance programs 130 million of letters of credit outstanding for our demand revenue bonds and 38 million of surety bonds outstanding primarily for certain utility payment obligations at some of our stores 

technology assets we have commitments totaling approximately 24 million to primarily purchase store technology assets for our stores during 2014 

telecommunication contracts we have contracted for telecommunication services with contracts expiring in 2017 the total amount of these commitments is approximately 193 million 

derivative financial instruments 

in 2013 we were party to fuel derivative contracts with third parties which included approximately 28 million gallons of diesel fuel or approximately 20 of our domestic truckload fuel needs these derivative contracts did not qualify for hedge accounting and therefore all changes in fair value for these derivatives are included in earnings we did not have any active fuel derivative contracts as of february 1 2014 

in march 2008 we entered into two 750 million interest rate swap agreements these interest rate swaps were used to manage the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations on a portion of our 2008 2500 million variable rate term loan under these agreements we paid interest to financial institutions at a fixed rate of 28 in exchange the financial institutions paid us at a variable rate which approximated the variable rate on the debt excluding the credit spread these swaps qualified for hedge accounting treatment and expired in march 2011 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates certain of our estimates require a high level of judgment and have the potential to have a material effect on the financial statements if actual results vary significantly   from those estimates following is a discussion of the estimates that we consider critical 

inventory valuation 

as discussed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 1  summary of significant account policies under the caption merchandise inventories beginning on page 35 of this form 10k inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weightedaverage basis cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weightedaverage basis under the retail inventory method the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated costtoretail ratio to the retail value of inventories the retail inventory method is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis 

inventory valuation methods require certain significant management estimates and judgments including estimates of future merchandise markdowns and shrink which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins the averaging required in applying the retail inventory method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns could under certain circumstances result in costs not being recorded in the proper period 

we estimate our markdown reserve based on the consideration of a variety of factors including but not limited to quantities of slow moving or seasonal carryover merchandise on hand historical markdown statistics and future merchandising plans the accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors some of which are outside of our control including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends historically we have not experienced significant differences in our estimated reserve for markdowns compared with actual results 

our accrual for shrink is based on the actual historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories adjusted if necessary for current economic conditions and business trends these estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger our physical inventory counts are generally taken between january and september of each year therefore the shrink accrual recorded at february 1 2014  is based on estimated shrink for most of 2013  including the fourth quarter we have not experienced significant fluctuations in historical shrink rates beyond approximately 1020 basis points in our dollar tree stores for the last few years however we have sometimes experienced higher than typical shrink in acquired stores in the year following an acquisition we periodically adjust our shrink estimates to address these factors as they become apparent 

our management believes that our application of the retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market each year on a consistent basis 

accrued expenses 

on a monthly basis we estimate certain expenses in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred certain expenses such as legal reserves require a high degree of judgment and our most material estimates include domestic freight expenses selfinsurance costs storelevel operating expenses such as property taxes and utilities and certain other expenses 

we are involved in numerous legal proceedings and claims our accruals if any related to these proceedings and claims are based on a determination of whether or not the loss is both probable and estimable we review outstanding matters with external counsel to assess the probability of an unfavorable outcome and estimates of loss we reevaluate outstanding proceedings and claims each quarter or as new and significant information becomes available and we adjust or establish accruals if necessary our legal proceedings are described in note 4  commitments and contingencies under the caption contingencies beginning on page 42 of this form 10k included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

our freight and storelevel operating expenses are estimated based on current activity and historical trends and results our workers compensation and general liability insurance accruals are recorded based on actuarial valuations which are adjusted at least annually based on a review performed by a thirdparty actuary these actuarial valuations are estimates based on our historical loss development factors certain other expenses are estimated and recorded in the periods that management becomes aware of them the related accruals are adjusted as management’s estimates change 

differences in managements estimates and assumptions could result in accruals which are materially different from the calculated accruals our experience has been that some of our estimates are too high and others are too low historically the net total of these differences has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

income taxes 

on a quarterly basis we estimate our required income tax liability and assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets our income taxes payable are estimated based on enacted tax rates including estimated tax rates in states where our store base is growing applied to the income expected to be taxed currently management assesses the recoverability of deferred tax assets based on the availability of carrybacks of future deductible amounts and management’s projections for future taxable income we cannot guarantee that we will generate taxable income in future years historically we have not experienced significant differences in our estimates of our tax accrual 

in addition we have a recorded liability for our estimate of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns judgment is required in evaluating the application of federal and state tax laws including relevant case law and assessing whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination and if so judgment is also required as to the measurement of the amount of tax benefit that will be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or the final outcome differs from the amounts recorded we believe that our liability for uncertain tax positions is adequate for further discussion of our changes in reserves during 2013  see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data  note 3 to the consolidated financial statements” beginning on page 39 of this form 10k 

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations 

we experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales comparable store net sales operating income and net income and expect this trend to continue our results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors including 

 our highest sales periods are the christmas and easter seasons easter was observed on april 8 2012 march 31 2013 and will be observed on april 20 2014 we believe that the later easter in 2014 could result in a 80 million increase in sales in the first quarter of 2014 as compared to the first quarter of 2013 we generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and of our operating and net income during the fourth quarter in anticipation of increased sales activity during these months we purchase substantial amounts of inventory and hire a significant number of temporary employees to supplement our continuing store staff our operating results particularly operating and net income could suffer if our net sales were below seasonal norms during the fourth quarter or during the easter season for any reason including merchandise delivery delays due to receiving or distribution problems changes in consumer sentiment or inclement weather 

our unaudited results of operations for the eight most recent quarters are shown in a table in note 11 of the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

inflation and other economic factors 

our ability to provide quality merchandise at a fixed price and on a profitable basis may be subject to economic factors and influences that we cannot control consumer spending could decline because of economic pressures including unemployment and rising fuel prices reductions in consumer confidence and spending could have an adverse effect on our sales national or international events including war or terrorism could lead to disruptions in economies in the united states or in foreign countries these and other factors could increase our merchandise costs fuel costs and other costs that are critical to our operations such as shipping and wage rates 

shipping costs  transpacific shipping rates are negotiated with individual freight lines and are subject to fluctuation based on shipping industry market conditions and fuel costs  we can give no assurances as to the final rate trends for 2014  as we are in the early stages of our negotiations 

minimum wage   multiple states and local jurisdictions passed legislation that increase their minimum wages in 2014 and 2015 and the federal government has made indications that it may consider increasing the federal minimum wage as a result we believe our expenses could increase unless we are able to offset the increase in payroll costs by operating more effectively or efficiently 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of our business including the impact of interest rate changes and diesel fuel cost changes we may enter into interest rate or diesel fuel swaps to manage exposure to interest rate and diesel fuel price changes we do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging and we do not hold derivative instruments for trading purposes 

diesel fuel cost risk 

in order to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in diesel fuel costs we entered into fuel derivative contracts with third parties we hedged 28 million  48 million  and 35 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2013  2012  and 2011 respectively these hedges represented approximately 20  35  and 31 of our total domestic truckload fuel needs in 2013  2012  and 2011 respectively under these contracts we pay the third party a fixed price for diesel fuel and receive variable diesel fuel prices at amounts approximating current diesel fuel costs thereby creating the economic equivalent of a fixedrate obligation these derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and therefore all changes in fair value for these derivatives are included in earnings we did not have any active fuel derivative contracts as of february 1 2014  

interest rate risk 

we use variablerate debt to finance certain of our operations and capital improvements these obligations expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates if interest rates increase interest expense increases conversely if interest rates decrease interest expense also decreases we believe it is beneficial to limit the variability of our interest payments 

to meet this objective we entered into derivative instruments in the form of two 750 million interest rate swaps in march 2008 to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in the variableinterest rates on a portion of our 2008 2500 million term loan the interest rate swaps reduced the interest rate exposure on these variablerate obligations under the interest rate swaps we paid the bank at a fixedrate and received variableinterest at a rate approximating the variablerate on the obligation thereby creating the economic equivalent of a fixedrate obligation these swaps expired in march 2011

 item 1 business 

overview 

we are the leading operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise at the fixed price of 100 we believe the variety and quality of products we sell for 100 sets us apart from our competitors at february 2 2013  we operated 4671 discount variety retail stores our stores operate under the names of dollar tree deal dollar tree deal dollar tree canada dollar giant and dollar bills in 4476 of these stores we sell substantially all items for 100 or less in the united states and 125cad or less in canada in substantially all of the remaining stores operating as deal we sell items for 100 or less but also sell items for more than 100 

we believe our optimal store size is between 8000 and 10000 selling square feet this store size provides the appropriate amount of space for our broad merchandise offerings while allowing us to provide ease of shopping to our customers as we have been expanding our merchandise offerings we have added freezers and coolers to approximately 2550 stores to increase sales and shopping frequency at january 31 2009 we operated 3591 stores in 48 states at february 2 2013  we operated 4531 stores in 48 states and the district of columbia as well as 140 stores in canada our selling square footage increased from approximately 303 million square feet in january 2009 to 405 million square feet in february 2013 our store growth has resulted primarily from opening new stores and the acquisition of dollar giant 

business strategy 

value merchandise offering  we strive to exceed our customers expectations of the variety and quality of products that they can purchase for 100 by offering items that we believe typically sell for higher prices elsewhere we buy approximately 58 to 60 of our merchandise domestically and import the remaining 40 to 42 our domestic purchases include basic seasonal closeouts and promotional merchandise we believe our mix of imported and domestic merchandise affords our buyers flexibility that allows them to consistently exceed the customers expectations in addition direct relationships with manufacturers permit us to select from a broad range of products and customize packaging product sizes and package quantities that meet our customers needs 

mix of basic variety and seasonal merchandise we maintain a balanced selection of products within traditional variety store categories we offer a wide selection of everyday basic products and we supplement these basic everyday items with seasonal closeout and promotional merchandise we attempt to keep certain basic consumable merchandise in our stores continuously to establish our stores as a destination and we have slightly increased the mix of consumable merchandise in order to increase the traffic in our stores closeout merchandise is purchased opportunistically and represents less than 10 of our purchases 

our merchandise mix consists of 

 we have added freezers and coolers to certain stores and increased the amount of consumable merchandise carried by those stores we believe this initiative helps drive additional transactions and allows us to appeal to a broader demographic mix we have added freezers and coolers to 330 additional stores in 2012  therefore as of february 2 2013  we have freezers and coolers in 2550 of our stores we plan to add them to 475 more stores in 2013  as a result of the installation of freezers and coolers in select stores consumable merchandise has grown as a percentage of purchases and sales and we expect this trend to continue the following table shows the percentage of sales of each major product group for the years ended february 2 2013  and january 28 2012  



at any point in time we carry approximately 6500 items in our stores and as of the end of 2012  approximately 3800 of our basic everyday items are automatically replenished the remaining items are primarily ordered by our store managers on a weekly basis through automatic replenishment and our store managers’ ability to order product each store manager is able to satisfy the demands of their particular customer base 

customer payment methods all of our stores in the united states accept cash checks debit cards and credit cards  along with the shift to more consumables and the rollout of freezers and coolers we have increased the number of stores accepting electronic benefits transfer ebt cards and food stamps under the supplemental nutrition assistance program “snap” to approximately 4200 stores as of february 2 2013  

convenient locations and store size we primarily focus on opening new stores in strip shopping centers anchored by mass merchandisers or grocers whose target customers we believe to be similar to ours our stores have proven successful in metropolitan areas midsized cities and small towns the range of our store sizes allows us to target a particular location with a store that best suits that market and takes advantage of available real estate opportunities our stores are attractively designed and create an inviting atmosphere for shoppers by using bright lighting vibrant colors and decorative signs we enhance the store design with attractive merchandise displays we believe this design attracts new and repeat customers and enhances our image as both a destination and impulse purchase store 

for more information on retail locations and retail store leases see item 2 properties” beginning on page 12 of this form 10k 

profitable stores with strong cash flow we maintain a disciplined costsensitive approach to store site selection in order to minimize the initial capital investment required and maximize our potential to generate high operating margins and strong cash flows we believe that our stores have a relatively small shopping radius which allows us to profitably concentrate multiple stores within a single market our ability to open new stores is dependent upon among other factors locating suitable sites and negotiating favorable lease terms 

the strong cash flows generated by our stores allow us to selffund infrastructure investment and new stores over the past five years cash flows from operating activities have exceeded capital expenditures 

for more information on our results of operations see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” beginning on page 19 of this form 10k 

cost control  we believe that our substantial buying power and our flexibility in making sourcing decisions contributes to our successful purchasing strategy which includes targeted merchandise margin goals by category we also believe our ability to select quality merchandise helps to minimize markdowns we buy products on an orderbyorder basis and have no material longterm purchase contracts or other assurances of continued product supply or guaranteed product cost no vendor accounted for more than 10 of total merchandise purchased in any of the past five years 

our supply chain systems continue to provide us with valuable sales information to assist our buyers and improve merchandise allocation to our stores controlling our inventory levels has resulted in more efficient distribution and store operations 

information systems we believe that investments in technology help us to increase sales and control costs our inventory management system has allowed us to improve the efficiency of our supply chain improve merchandise flow increase inventory turnover and control distribution and store operating costs our automatic replenishment system replenishes key items based on actual store level sales and inventory at the end of 2012  we had approximately 3800 basic everyday items on automatic replenishment 

pointofsale data allows us to track sales and inventory by merchandise category at the store level and assists us in planning for future purchases of inventory we believe that this information allows us to ship the appropriate product to stores at the quantities commensurate with selling patterns using this pointofsale data to plan purchases of inventory has helped us increase our inventory turns in each of the last five years our inventory turns were 43 in 2012  

corporate culture and values we believe that honesty and integrity doing the right things for the right reasons and treating people fairly and with respect are core values within our corporate culture we believe that running a business and certainly a public company carries with it a responsibility to be above reproach when making operational and financial decisions our executive management team visits and shops our stores like every customer and ideas and individual creativity on the part of our associates are encouraged particularly from our store managers who know their stores and their customers we have standards for store displays merchandise presentation and store operations we maintain an open door 

policy for all associates our distribution centers are operated based on objective measures of performance and virtually everyone in our store support center is available to assist associates in the stores and distribution centers 

our disclosure committee meets at least quarterly and monitors our internal controls over financial reporting to ensure that our public filings contain discussions about the risks our business faces we believe that we have the controls in place to be able to certify our financial statements additionally we have complied with the listing requirements for the nasdaq stock market 

growth strategy 

store openings and square footage growth the primary factors contributing to our net sales growth have been new store openings an active store expansion and remodel program and selective mergers and acquisitions in the last five years net sales increased at a compound annual growth rate of 123 we expect that the majority of our future sales growth will come primarily from new store openings and from our store expansion and relocation program 

the following table shows the average selling square footage of our stores and the selling square footage per new store opened over the last five years our growth and productivity statistics are reported based on selling square footage because our management believes the use of selling square footage yields a more accurate measure of store productivity 



we expect to increase our selling square footage in the future by opening new stores in underserved markets and strategically increasing our presence in our existing markets via new store openings and store expansions expansions include store relocations in fiscal 2013  and beyond we plan to predominantly open stores that are approximately 8000  10000 selling square feet and we believe this size allows us to achieve our objectives in the markets in which we plan to expand at february 2 2013  approximately 2560 of our stores totaling 654 of our selling square footage were 8000 selling square feet or larger  

we also continue to grow our deal format which offers an expanded assortment of merchandise including items that sell for more than 100 these stores provide us an opportunity to leverage our dollar tree infrastructure in different merchandise concepts including higher price points without disrupting the singleprice point model in our dollar tree stores we operated 194 deal stores as of february 2 2013  

in addition to new store openings we plan to continue our store expansion program to increase our net sales per store and take advantage of market opportunities we target stores for expansion based on the current sales per selling square foot and changes in market opportunities stores targeted for expansion are generally less than 6000 selling square feet in size store expansions generally increase the existing store size by approximately 3300 selling square feet 

since 1995 we have added a total of 695 stores through several mergers and acquisitions our acquisition strategy has been to target companies that have a similar singleprice point concept that have shown success in operations or companies that provide a strategic advantage we evaluate potential acquisition opportunities as they become available 

in november 2010 we completed our acquisition of 86 dollar giant stores based in vancouver british columbia these stores offer a wide assortment of quality general merchandise contemporary seasonal goods and everyday consumables all priced at 125 cad or less the stores that we acquired operate in the canadian provinces of british columbia ontario alberta and saskatchewan and we now have stores in manitoba this is the first expansion of our retail operations outside of the united states and provides us with a proven management team and distribution network as well as additional potential store growth in a new market 

from time to time we also acquire the rights to store leases through bankruptcy or other proceedings we will continue to take advantage of these opportunities as they arise depending upon several factors including their fit within our location and selling square footage size parameters 

merchandising and distribution expanding our customer base is important to our growth plans we plan to continue to stock our new stores with a compelling mix of everchanging merchandise that our customers have come to appreciate consumable merchandise typically leads to more frequent return trips to our stores resulting in increased sales the presentation and display of merchandise in our stores are critical to communicating value to our customers and creating a more exciting shopping experience we believe our approach to visual merchandising results in higher sales volume and an environment that encourages impulse purchases 

a strong and efficient distribution network is critical to our ability to grow and to maintain a lowcost operating structure in july 2012 we began construction on a new 10 million square foot distribution center in windsor connecticut which is expected to begin shipping product in 2013 in 2013 we plan to expand our marietta oklahoma distribution center to 10 million square feet and lease an additional 04 million square feet at our distribution center in san bernardino california in 2011 we expanded our savannah distribution center to 10 million square feet in 2009 we purchased a new distribution center in san bernardino california which began shipping merchandise in april 2010 this distribution center replaced the salt lake city distribution center which closed when its lease expired in april 2010 we believe our distribution center network is currently capable of supporting approximately 80 billion in annual sales in the united states upon completion of the additional distribution center capacity listed above we believe our distribution center network will support approximately 102 billion in annual sales in the united states new distribution sites are strategically located to reduce stem miles maintain flexibility and improve efficiency in our store service areas we also are a party to an agreement which provides distribution services from two facilities in canada 

our stores receive approximately 90 of their inventory from our distribution centers via contract carriers the remaining store inventory primarily perishable consumable items and other vendormaintained display items are delivered directly to our stores from vendors for more information on our distribution center network see item 2 “properties” beginning on page 12 of this form 10k 

competition 

the retail industry is highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future we operate in the discount retail merchandise business which is currently and is expected to continue to be highly competitive with respect to price store location merchandise quality assortment and presentation and customer service our competitors include singleprice dollar stores multiprice dollar stores mass merchandisers discount retailers and variety retailers in addition several competitors have locations with dollar price point merchandise in their stores which increases competition we believe we differentiate ourselves from other retailers by providing high value high quality low cost merchandise in attractively designed stores that are conveniently located our sales and profits could be reduced by increases in competition there are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector 

trademarks 

we are the owners of several federal service mark registrations including dollar tree the dollar tree logo the dollar tree logo with a “1” and one priceone dollar in addition we own a concurrent use registration for dollar bill and the related logo we also acquired the rights to use trade names previously owned by everythings a dollar a former competitor in the 100 price point industry several trade names were included in the purchase including the marks everythings 100 we mean everything and everythings 100 with the acquisition of deal we became the owners of the trademark deal” with the acquisition of dollar giant we became the owners of the trademark “dollar giant” and others in canada   we have federal trademark registrations for a variety of private labels that we use to market some of our product lines our trademark registrations have various expiration dates however assuming that the trademark registrations are properly renewed they have a perpetual duration 

employees 

we employed approximately 15380 fulltime and 66540 parttime associates on february 2 2013  parttime associates work an average of less than 35 hours per week the number of parttime associates fluctuates depending on seasonal needs we consider our relationship with our associates to be good and we have not experienced significant interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements 




 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk any failure to meet market expectations including our comparable store sales growth rate earnings and earnings per share or new store openings could cause the market price of our stock to decline you should carefully consider the specific risk factors listed below together with all other information included or incorporated in this report any of the following risks may materialize and additional risks not known to us or that we now deem immaterial may arise in such event our business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected 

our profitability is vulnerable to cost increases 

future increase in costs such as the cost of merchandise wage and benefit costs shipping rates freight costs fuel costs and store occupancy costs may reduce our profitability we do not raise the sales price of our merchandise to offset cost increases because we are committed to selling primarily at the 100 price point to continue to provide value to the customer we are dependent on our ability to adjust our product assortment to operate more efficiently or effectively or to increase our comparable store net sales in order to offset inflation we can give no assurance that we will be able to operate more efficiently or increase our comparable store net sales in the future please see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations beginning on page 19 of this form 10k for further discussion of the effect of inflation and other economic factors on our operations 

a downturn in economic conditions could impact our sales 

deterioration in economic conditions such as those caused by a recession inflation higher unemployment consumer debt levels lack of available credit cost increases as well as adverse weather conditions or terrorism could reduce consumer spending or cause customers to shift their spending to products we either do not sell or do not sell as profitably adverse economic conditions could disrupt consumer spending and significantly reduce our sales decrease our inventory turnover cause greater markdowns or reduce our profitability due to lower margins 

litigation may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of   operations 

our business is subject to the risk of litigation involving employees consumers suppliers competitors shareholders government agencies or others through private actions class actions administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation we are currently defendants in several employmentrelated class action cases and changes in federal law could cause these types of claims to rise the outcome of litigation particularly class action lawsuits regulatory actions and intellectual property claims is difficult to assess or quantify plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to these lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time in addition certain of these lawsuits if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in liability material to our financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operation are required the cost to defend current and future litigation may be significant there also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation including litigation related to product safety and customer information which could negatively affect customer perception of our business regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable 

for a discussion of current legal matters please see item 3 “legal proceedings” beginning on page 13 of this form 10k resolution of certain matters described in that item if decided against the company could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations accrued liabilities or cash flows 

changes in federal state or local law or our failure to comply with such laws could increase our expenses and expose us to legal risks 

our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations significant legislative changes such as the healthcare legislation that impact our relationship with our workforce could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations changes in other regulatory areas such as consumer credit privacy and information security product safety or environmental protection among others could cause our expenses to increase in addition if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations particularly wage and hour laws we could be subject to legal risk including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation which could adversely affect our results of operations changes in tax laws the interpretation of existing laws or our failure to sustain our reporting positions on examination could adversely affect our effective tax rate 

our growth is dependent on our ability to increase sales in existing stores and to expand our square footage profitably 

existing store sales growth is dependent on a variety of factors including merchandise selection and availability store operations and customer satisfaction in addition competition could affect our sales our highest sales periods are the christmas and easter seasons and we generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and our operating and net income during the fourth quarter in anticipation we stock extra inventory and hire many temporary employees to prepare our stores a reduction in sales during these periods could adversely affect our operating results particularly operating and net income to a greater extent than if a reduction occurred at other times of the year untimely merchandise delays due to receiving or distribution problems could have a similar effect easter was observed on april 24 2011 april 8 2012 and will be observed on march 31 2013 

expanding our square footage profitably depends on a number of uncertainties including our ability to locate lease build out and open or expand stores in suitable locations on a timely basis under favorable economic terms in addition our expansion is dependent upon thirdparty developers’ abilities to acquire land obtain financing and secure necessary permits and approvals turmoil in the financial markets has made it difficult for third party developers to obtain financing for new projects we also open or expand stores within our established geographic markets where new or expanded stores may draw sales away from our existing stores we may not manage our expansion effectively and our failure to achieve our expansion plans could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks associated with our domestic and foreign suppliers from whom our products are sourced could affect our financial performance 

we are dependent on our vendors to supply merchandise in a timely and efficient manner if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments due to financial or other difficulties we could experience merchandise shortages which could lead to lost sales or increased merchandise costs if alternative sources must be used 

merchandise imported directly accounts for approximately 40 to 42 of our total retail value purchases in addition we believe that a portion of our goods purchased from domestic vendors is imported china is the source of a substantial majority of our imports imported goods are generally less expensive than domestic goods and increase our profit margins a disruption in the flow of our imported merchandise or an increase in the cost of those goods may significantly decrease our profits risks associated with our reliance on imported goods may include disruptions in the flow of or increases in the cost of imported goods because of factors such as 

 we could encounter disruptions in our distribution network or additional costs in distributing merchandise 

our success is dependent on our ability to transport merchandise to our distribution centers and then ship it to our stores in a timely and costeffective manner we may not anticipate respond to or control all of the challenges of operating our receiving and distribution systems additionally if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments we could experience merchandise shortages that could lead to lost sales or increased costs some of the factors that could have an adverse effect on our distribution network or costs are 

 our profitability is affected by the mix of products we sell 

our gross profit margin could decrease if we increase the proportion of higher cost goods we sell in the future in recent years the percentage of our sales from higher cost consumable products has increased and is likely to increase in 2013  as a result our gross profit margin could decrease unless we are able to maintain our current merchandise cost sufficiently to offset any decrease in our product margin percentage we can give no assurance that we will be able to do so 

pressure from competitors may reduce our sales and profits 

the retail industry is highly competitive the marketplace is highly fragmented as many different retailers compete for market share by utilizing a variety of store formats and merchandising strategies we expect competition to increase in the future there are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector some of our current or potential competitors have greater financial resources than we do we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors please see item 1 “business” beginning on page 5 of this form 10k for further discussion of the effect of competition on our operations 

a significant disruption in or security breach in our computer systems could adversely affect our operations or our ability to secure customer employee and company data 

we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory process customer transactions and summarize results systems may be subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunication failures computer viruses security breaches and catastrophic events if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process customer transactions which could aversely affect our results of operations 

the protection of customer employee and company data is increasingly demanding with frequent imposition of new requirements across our business in addition our customers have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information a significant breach of customer employee or company data could damage our reputation and result in lost sales fines andor lawsuits 

our business could be adversely affected if we fail to attract and retain qualified associates and key personnel 

our growth and performance is dependent on the skills experience and contributions of our associates executives and key personnel various factors including overall labor availability wage rates regulatory or legislative impacts and benefit costs could impact the ability to attract and retain qualified associates at our stores distribution centers and corporate office 

certain provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws could delay or discourage a takeover attempt that may be in a shareholders best interest   

our articles of incorporation and bylaws currently contain provisions that may delay or discourage a takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider in his best interest these provisions among other things 

 however we believe that these provisions allow our board of directors to negotiate a higher price in the event of a takeover attempt which would be in the best interest of our shareholders

 item 2 properties 

stores 

as of february 2 2013  we operated 4671 stores in 48 states and the district of columbia as well as the canadian provinces of british columbia ontario alberta saskatchewan and manitoba as detailed below 



we lease the vast majority of our stores and expect to lease the majority of our new stores as we expand our leases typically provide for a short initial lease term generally five years with options to extend however in some cases we have initial lease terms of seven to ten years we believe this leasing strategy enhances our flexibility to pursue various expansion opportunities resulting from changing market conditions as current leases expire we believe that we will be able to obtain lease renewals if desired for present store locations or to obtain leases for equivalent or better locations in the same general area 

distribution centers 

the following table includes information about the distribution centers that we own and operate in the united states in 2011 we expanded our savannah distribution center to 10 million square feet in 2009 we purchased a new distribution center in san bernardino california which began shipping merchandise in april 2010 this facility replaced the salt lake city distribution center which closed when its lease expired in april 2010 we believe our distribution center network is currently capable of supporting approximately 80 billion in annual sales in the united states in 2012 we began construction on a new 10 million square foot distribution center in windsor connecticut which is expected to begin shipping product in 2013 in 2013 we plan to expand our marietta oklahoma distribution center to 10 million square feet and lease an additional 04 million square feet at our san bernardino california distribution center upon completion of this additional distribution center capacity we believe our distribution center network will support approximately 102 billion in annual sales in the united states 



each of our distribution centers contains advanced materials handling technologies including radiofrequency inventory tracking equipment and specialized information systems with the exception of our ridgefield facility each of our distribution centers in the united states also contains automated conveyor and sorting systems 

we are also a party to an agreement which provides distribution services from facilities in british columbia and ontario

 item 3 legal proceedings 

from time to time we are defendants in ordinary routine litigation or proceedings incidental to our business including allegations regarding 

 

in 2006 a former store manager filed a collective action against us in alabama federal court she claims that she and other store managers should have been classified as nonexempt employees under the fair labor standards act and received overtime compensation the court preliminarily allowed nationwide except california certification our motion to decertify the collective action was dismissed without prejudice in 2010 we filed another motion to decertify on february 29 2012 that motion was granted on november 2 2012 the individual claims of the four named plaintiffs were consolidated and proceeded to trial on february 22 2013 on march 1 a jury returned four verdicts in our favor on that day the court entered final judgement in favor of us against all four plaintiffs and dismissed the cases without prejudice we anticipate post trial motions will be filed by the plaintiffs asking that the court set aside the final judgement and the jury verdicts the individual claims of the 261 optin plaintiffs were dismissed in the november 2nd order without prejudice seventyfive of those optin decertified plaintiffs have recently filed individual claims in eight different federal courts throughout the united states none of these cases have as yet proceeded beyond the pleadings stage so that discovery has not begun nor have any cases been set for trial

in the summer and fall of 2011 five collective action lawsuits were filed against us in federal courts in georgia colorado florida michigan and illinois by different assistant store managers each alleging he or she was forced to work off the clock in violation of the federal fair labor standards act plaintiffs also asserted various state law claims for which they seek class treatment the michigan case is currently stayed the florida case has been transferred to the us district court for the eastern district of virginia which thereafter entered an order staying the case in the georgia case the state law claims were dismissed and the case then transferred to the us district court for the eastern district of virginia the fair labor standards act claims remain with motions to dismiss by us pending in the colorado case the statewide class claims were dismissed the court conditionally certified under the fair labor standards act a class of all assistant store managers who worked for dollar tree from july 16 2008 to the present notice was sent to potential class members and 2201 elected to optin discovery is now ongoing pursuant to a scheduling order of the court and the case has been assigned a may 2014 trial date the illinois case in addition to assistant store managers also included a putative class of all other hourly store associates and made the same allegations on their behalf the illinois case was transferred to the eastern district of virginia in june and the virginia federal judge ruled that all claims made on behalf of assistant store managers under the fair labor standards act should be dismissed on the basis those claims could be adjudicated in the colorado case the assistant store manager class claims based on state law were dismissed the court however did conditionally certify under the fair labor standards act a class of all hourly sales associates who worked for dollar tree from october 2 2009 to the present notice to the putative class was sent and 6276 associates elected to optin approximately 3 of the potential class discovery has recently commenced no trial date has been established 

in may 2012 three associates who were formerly employed at our distribution center in joliet illinois filed a rule 23 class action lawsuit in federal court in illinois alleging that at the time of their termination of employment they failed to receive compensation for their accrued paid time off they brought this case on behalf of themselves and those former associates similarly situated at the request of the parties the case was stayed and referred to a us magistrate judge for a settlement conference a settlement was reached and preliminarily approved by the court notice of the proposed settlement was issued to the individual potential class members with 113 of them returning completed claims forms the court conducted a fairness hearing on february 27 and approved the settlement the settlement process will now be effectuated the settlement amount is immaterial and has been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

in july 2012 a former nonexempt hourly associate who alleges his primary duty was to work a cash register on behalf of himself and those similarly situated filed a complaint under the california private attorneys general act “paga” in a california state court alleging we failed to provide suitable seating at our cash registers as allegedly required by state law we removed the case to federal court and filed our answer to the complaint discovery is presently under way and the case has been scheduled for trial in july 2013

resolved based on the information available including the amount of time remaining before trial the results of discovery and the judgment of internal and external counsel we are unable to express an opinion as to the outcome of those matters which are not settled and cannot estimate a potential range of loss on the outstanding matters

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

in management’s discussion and analysis we explain the general financial condition and the results of operations for our company including 

 as you read management’s discussion and analysis please refer to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10k which present the results of operations for the fiscal years ended february 2 2013  january 28 2012  and january 29 2011  in management’s discussion and analysis we analyze and explain the annual changes in some specific line items in the consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2012  compared to fiscal year 2011  and for fiscal year 2011  compared to fiscal year 2010  

key events and recent developments 

several key events have had or are expected to have a significant effect on our operations you should keep in mind that 

 overview 

our net sales are derived from the sale of merchandise two major factors tend to affect our net sales trends first is our success at opening new stores or adding new stores through acquisitions second sales vary at our existing stores from one year to the next we refer to this change as a change in comparable store net sales because we compare only those stores that are open throughout both of the periods being compared we include sales from stores expanded during the year in the 

calculation of comparable store net sales which has the effect of increasing our comparable store net sales the term expanded also includes stores that are relocated 

at february 2 2013  we operated 4671 stores in 48 states and the district of columbia as well as the canadian provinces of british columbia ontario alberta saskatchewan and manitoba with 405 million selling square feet compared to 4351 stores with 376 million selling square feet at january 28 2012  during fiscal 2012  we opened 345 stores expanded 87 stores and closed 25 stores compared to 278 new stores opened 91 stores expanded and 28 stores closed during fiscal 2011  in the current year we increased our selling square footage by 77 of the 345 stores opened in fiscal 2012 25 were opened in january and five were expanded in january 2013 excluding these stores our selling square footage increased by 71 of the 29 million selling square foot increase in 2012  03 million was added by expanding existing stores the average size of our stores opened in 2012  was approximately 8060 selling square feet or about 9900 gross square feet for 2013  we continue to plan to open stores that are approximately 8000  10000 selling square feet or about 10000  12000 gross square feet we believe that this store size is our optimal size operationally and that this size also gives our customers an ideal shopping environment that invites them to shop longer and buy more 

fiscal 2012 ended on february 2 2013 and included 53 weeks commensurate with the retail calendar the 53rd week in 2012 added approximately 125 million in sales fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 which ended on january 28 2012 and january 29 2011 respectively each included 52 weeks 

in fiscal 2012  comparable store net sales increased by 34 this increase was based on the comparable 53 weeks for both years the comparable store net sales increase was the result of a 28 increase in the number of transactions and a 06 increase in average ticket we believe comparable store net sales continued to be positively affected by a number of our initiatives as debit and credit card penetration continued to increase in 2012  and we continued the rollout of frozen and refrigerated merchandise to more of our stores at february 2 2013  we had frozen and refrigerated merchandise in approximately 2550 stores compared to approximately 2220 stores at january 28 2012  we believe that the addition of frozen and refrigerated product enables us to increase sales and earnings by increasing the number of shopping trips made by our customers in addition we accept food stamps under the supplemental nutrition assistance program “snap” in approximately 4200 qualified stores compared to 3860 at the end of 2011  

with the pressures of the current economic environment we have seen continued demand for basic consumable products in 2012  as a result we have continued to shift the mix of inventory carried in our stores to more consumer product merchandise which we believe increases the traffic in our stores and has helped to increase our sales even during the current economic downturn while this shift in mix has impacted our merchandise costs we were able to offset that impact in the current year with decreased costs for merchandise in many of our categories 

our pointofsale technology provides us with valuable sales and inventory information to assist our buyers and improve our merchandise allocation to our stores we believe that this has enabled us to better manage our inventory flow resulting in more efficient distribution and store operations and increased inventory turnover for each of the last five years 

we must continue to control our merchandise costs inventory levels and our general and administrative expenses as increases in these line items could negatively impact our operating results 

results of operations 

the following table expresses items from our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales on january 31 2010 the first day of fiscal 2010 we began using approximately 30 inventory pools in our retail inventory calculation rather than one inventory pool as we had used since our inception as a result of this change we recorded a nonrecurring noncash charge to gross profit and a corresponding reduction in inventory at cost of 263 million in the first quarter of 2010 



fiscal year ended february 2 2013  compared to fiscal year ended january 28 2012   

net sales  net sales increased 115 or 7640 million in 2012 compared to 2011 resulting from sales in our new stores and the 53rd week in 2012 which accounted for approximately 125 million of the increase our sales increase was also impacted by a 34 increase in comparable store net sales for the year this increase is based on a 53week comparison for both periods comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores which we include in the calculation and to a lesser extent are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing ones 

the following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store count for fiscal years ended february 2 2013  and january 28 2012  



of the 345 new stores added in 2012 25 stores were opened in january 2013 of the 29 million selling square foot increase in 2012  approximately 03 million was added by expanding existing stores 

gross profit margin was 359 in 2012 and 2011 improvement in initial markup in many categories and occupancy and distribution cost leverage were offset by an increase in the mix of higher cost consumer product merchandise and higher freight costs in fiscal 2012 than in fiscal 2011 

selling general and administrative expenses  selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 235 for 2012 compared to 241 for 2011 the decrease is primarily due to the following 

 21 

 operating income  operating income margin was 124 in 2012 compared to 118 in 2011 due to the reasons noted above operating income margin improved 60 basis points 

other income net  other income net in 2012 includes a 608 million gain on the sale of our investment in ollies holdings inc 

income taxes  our effective tax rate was 367 in 2012 compared to 374 in 2011 this decrease is the result of statute expirations and the settlement of state tax audits 

fiscal year ended january 28 2012  compared to fiscal year ended january 29 2011   

net sales  net sales increased 127 or 7480 million in 2011 compared to 2010 resulting from sales in our new stores and a 60 increase in comparable store net sales comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores which we include in the calculation and to a lesser extent are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing ones 

the following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store count for fiscal years ended january 28 2012  and january 29 2011  



of the 24 million selling square foot increase in 2011 approximately 03 million was added by expanding existing stores 

gross profit margin was 359 in 2011 compared to 355 in 2010 excluding the effect of the 263 million noncash beginning inventory adjustment gross profit margin remained at 359 improvement in initial markup in many categories and occupancy and distribution cost leverage were offset by an increase in the mix of higher cost consumer product merchandise and a smaller reduction in the shrink accrual rate in fiscal 2011 than in fiscal 2010 

selling general and administrative expenses  selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 241 for 2011 compared to 248 for 2010 the decrease is primarily due to the following 

 operating income  operating income margin was 118 in 2011 compared to 107 in 2010 excluding the 263 million noncash adjustment to beginning inventory operating income margin was 111 in 2010 due to the reasons noted above operating income margin excluding this charge improved 70 basis points 

income taxes  our effective tax rate was 374 in 2011 and 369 in 2010 

liquidity and capital resources 

our business requires capital to build and open new stores expand our distribution network and operate and expand existing stores our working capital requirements for existing stores are seasonal and usually reach their peak in september and october historically we have satisfied our seasonal working capital requirements for existing stores and have funded our store opening and distribution network expansion programs from internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities 

the following table compares cashflow related information for the years ended february 2 2013  january 28 2012  and january 29 2011  



net cash provided by operating activities decreased 88 million in 2012 compared to 2011 due to an increase in cash used to purchase merchandise inventory and cash used for prepaid rent as a result of february 1st falling in the last week of the fiscal year partially offset by increased earnings before income taxes depreciation and amortization in 2012 and increases in income taxes payable 

net cash provided by operating activities increased 1678 million in 2011 compared to 2010 due to increased earnings before income taxes depreciation and amortization in 2011 a decrease in cash used to purchase merchandise inventories and an increase in other current liabilities due to increases in sales tax collected and accrued expenses 

net cash used in investing activities increased 1752 million in 2012 primarily due to the sale of 1808 million of shortterm investments in 2011 versus none in 2012 and a 621 million increase in capital expenditures in 2012 due to the higher number of stores opened compared to 2011 and the construction of our distribution center in connecticut the 623 million in proceeds from the sale of the investment in ollies holdings inc provided cash for investing activities in 2012 

net cash used in investing activities decreased 2880 million in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to an additional 1700 million of proceeds from the sale of shortterm investments with minimal purchases of shortterm investments compared to 1578 million of purchases in 2010 the proceeds were used to fund the share repurchases in 2011 in addition in 2010 we used 494 million to acquire dollar giant these increased sources of cash were partially offset by a 714 million increase in capital expenditures in 2011 due to funds for new store projects and the expansion of our distribution center in savannah georgia 

in 2012 net cash used in financing activities decreased 3198 million as a result of reduced share repurchases in 2012 

in 2011 net cash used in financing activities increased 2189 million as a result of increased share repurchases in 2011 compared with 2010 

at february 2 2013  our longterm borrowings were 2713 million we also have 1100 million and 1000 million letter of credit reimbursement and security agreements under which approximately 1470 million were committed to letters of credit issued for routine purchases of imported merchandise at february 2 2013  

in june 2012 we entered into a fiveyear 7500 million unsecured credit agreement the agreement the agreement provides for a 7500 million revolving line of credit including up to 1500 million in available letters of credit the interest rate on the agreement is based at our option on a libor rate plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin the agreement also bears a facilities fee calculated as a percentage as defined of the amount available under the line of credit payable quarterly the agreement also bears an administrative fee payable annually the agreement among other things requires the maintenance of certain specified financial ratios restricts the payment of certain distributions and prohibits the incurrence of certain new indebtedness our february 2008 5500 million credit agreement was terminated concurrent with entering into this agreement as of february 2 2013  2500 million was outstanding under the 7500 million revolving line of credit 

we repurchased 81 million shares for 3402 million in fiscal 2012  we repurchased 87 million shares for 6459 million in fiscal 2011  we repurchased 93 million shares for 4147 million in fiscal 2010  at february 2 2013  we have 8598 million remaining under board authorization 

funding requirements 

overview including offbalance sheet arrangements 

we expect our cash needs for opening new stores and expanding existing stores in fiscal 2013  to total approximately 2006   million which includes capital expenditures initial inventory and preopening costs 

our estimated capital expenditures for fiscal 2013  are between 3200 and 3300 million including planned expenditures for our new and expanded stores the addition of freezers and coolers to approximately 475 stores and approximately 612 million to expand our distribution center in marietta oklahoma and complete construction on a new distribution center in windsor connecticut we believe that we can adequately fund our working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures for the next few years from net cash provided by operations and potential borrowings under our existing credit facility 

the following tables summarize our material contractual obligations at february 2 2013  including both on and offbalance sheet arrangements and our commitments including interest on longterm borrowings in millions 





lease financing 

operating lease obligations our operating lease obligations are primarily for payments under noncancelable store leases the commitment includes amounts for leases that were signed prior to february 2 2013  for stores that were not yet open on february 2 2013  

longterm borrowings 

credit agreement  in june 2012 we entered into a fiveyear 7500 million unsecured credit agreement the agreement the agreement provides for a 7500 million revolving line of credit including up to 1500 million in available letters of credit the interest rate on the facility is based at our option on a libor rate plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin the interest rate on the facility was 111 at february 2 2013  the revolving line of credit also bears a facilities fee calculated as a percentage as defined of the amount available under the line of credit payable quarterly the agreement among other things requires the maintenance of certain specified financial ratios restricts the payment of certain distributions and prohibits the incurrence of certain new indebtedness as of february 2 2013  2500 million was outstanding under the 7500 million revolving line of credit 

demand revenue bonds  in may 1998 we entered into an agreement with the mississippi business finance corporation under which it issued 190 million of variablerate demand revenue bonds we used the proceeds from the bonds to finance the acquisition construction and installation of land buildings machinery and equipment for our distribution facility in olive branch mississippi at february 2 2013  the balance outstanding on the bonds was 143 million these bonds are due to be fully repaid in june 2018 the bonds do not have a prepayment penalty as long as the interest rate remains variable the bonds contain a demand provision and therefore outstanding amounts are classified as current liabilities we pay interest monthly based on a variable interest rate which was 023 at february 2 2013  

forgivable promissory note   in 2012 we entered into a promissory note with the state of connecticut under which the state loaned us 70 million  in connection with the companys acquisition construction and installation of land building machinery and equipment for our distribution facility in windsor connecticut if certain performance targets are met the loan and any accrued interest will be forgiven in fiscal 2017 if the performance targets are not met the loan and accrued interest must be repaid beginning in fiscal 2017 

interest on longterm borrowings this amount represents interest payments on the credit agreement demand revenue bond and forgivable promissory note using the interest rates for each at february 2 2013  

commitments 

letters of credit and surety bonds  we are a party to two letter of credit reimbursement and security agreements one which provides 1100 million for letters of credit and one which provides 1000 million for letters of credit letters of credit are generally issued for the routine purchase of imported merchandise and we had approximately 1470 million of purchases committed under these letters of credit at february 2 2013  

we also have approximately 129 million of letters of credit outstanding for our selfinsurance programs 145 million of letters of credit outstanding for our demand revenue bonds and 31 million of surety bonds outstanding primarily for certain utility payment obligations at some of our stores 

technology assets we have commitments totaling approximately 108 million to primarily purchase store technology assets for our stores during 2012 

telecommunication contracts we have contracted for telecommunication services with contracts expiring in 2017 the total amount of these commitments is approximately 269 million 

derivative financial instruments 

in 2012 we were party to fuel derivative contracts with third parties which included approximately 48 million gallons of diesel fuel or approximately 35 of our domestic truckload fuel needs these derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and therefore all changes in fair value for these derivatives are included in earnings we currently have fuel derivative contracts to hedge 07 million gallons of diesel fuel or approximately 20 of our domestic truckload fuel needs from february 2013 through april 2013 

in march 2008 we entered into two 750 million interest rate swap agreements these interest rate swaps were used to manage the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations on a portion of our 2008 2500 million variable rate term loan under these agreements we paid interest to financial institutions at a fixed rate of 28 in exchange the financial institutions paid us at a variable rate which approximated the variable rate on the debt excluding the credit spread these swaps qualified for hedge accounting treatment and expired in march 2011 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates certain of our estimates require a high level of judgment and have the potential to have a material effect on the financial statements if actual results vary significantly   from those estimates following is a discussion of the estimates that we consider critical 

inventory valuation 

as discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weightedaverage basis cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weightedaverage basis under the retail inventory method the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated costtoretail ratio to the retail value of inventories from our inception and through fiscal 2009 we used one inventory pool for this calculation because of our investments over the years in our retail technology systems we were able to refine our estimate of inventory cost under the retail method and on january 31 2010 the first day of fiscal 2010 we began using approximately 30 inventory pools in our retail inventory calculation as a result of this change we recorded a nonrecurring noncash charge to gross profit and a corresponding reduction in inventory at cost of approximately 263 million in the first quarter of 2010 the retail inventory method is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis 

inventory valuation methods require certain significant management estimates and judgments including estimates of future merchandise markdowns and shrink which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins the averaging required in applying the retail inventory method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns could under certain circumstances result in costs not being recorded in the proper period 

we estimate our markdown reserve based on the consideration of a variety of factors including but not limited to quantities of slow moving or seasonal carryover merchandise on hand historical markdown statistics and future merchandising plans the accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors some of which are outside of our control including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends historically we have not experienced significant differences in our estimated reserve for markdowns compared with actual results 

our accrual for shrink is based on the actual historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories adjusted if necessary for current economic conditions and business trends these estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger our physical inventory counts are generally taken between january and september of each year therefore the shrink accrual recorded at february 2 2013  is based on estimated shrink for most of 2012  including the fourth quarter we have not experienced significant fluctuations in historical shrink rates beyond approximately 1020 basis points in our dollar tree stores for the last few years however we have sometimes experienced higher than typical shrink in acquired stores in the year following an acquisition we periodically adjust our shrink estimates to address these factors as they become apparent 

our management believes that our application of the retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market each year on a consistent basis 

accrued expenses 

on a monthly basis we estimate certain expenses in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred our most material estimates include domestic freight expenses selfinsurance costs storelevel operating expenses such as property taxes and utilities and certain other expenses such as legal reserves our freight and storelevel operating expenses are estimated based on current activity and historical trends and results our workers compensation and general liability insurance accruals are recorded based on actuarial valuations which are adjusted at least annually based on a review performed by a thirdparty actuary these actuarial valuations are estimates based on our historical loss development factors certain other expenses are estimated and recorded in the periods that management becomes aware of them the related accruals are adjusted as management’s estimates change differences in managements estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual materially different from the calculated accrual our experience has been that some of our estimates are too high and others are too low historically the net total of these differences has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations our legal proceedings are described in item 3 “legal proceedings” beginning on page 13 of this form 10k the outcome of litigation particularly class or collective action lawsuits is difficult to assess quantify or predict 

income taxes 

on a quarterly basis we estimate our required income tax liability and assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets our income taxes payable are estimated based on enacted tax rates including estimated tax rates in states where our store base is growing applied to the income expected to be taxed currently management assesses the recoverability of deferred tax assets based on the availability of carrybacks of future deductible amounts and management’s projections for future taxable income we cannot guarantee that we will generate taxable income in future years historically we have not experienced significant differences in our estimates of our tax accrual 

in addition we have a recorded liability for our estimate of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns judgment is required in evaluating the application of federal and state tax laws including relevant case law and assessing whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination and if so judgment is also required as to the measurement of the amount of tax benefit that will be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or the final outcome differs from the amounts recorded we believe that our liability for uncertain tax positions is adequate for further discussion of our changes in reserves during 2012  see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data  note 3 to the consolidated financial statements” beginning on page 40 of this form 10k 

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations 

we experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales comparable store net sales operating income and net income and expect this trend to continue our results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors including 

 our highest sales periods are the christmas and easter seasons easter was observed on april 24 2011 april 8 2012 and will be observed on march 31 2013 we believe that the earlier easter in 2013 could result in a 40 million decrease in sales in the first quarter of 2013 as compared to the first quarter of 2012 we generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net 

sales and of our operating and net income during the fourth quarter in anticipation of increased sales activity during these months we purchase substantial amounts of inventory and hire a significant number of temporary employees to supplement our continuing store staff our operating results particularly operating and net income could suffer if our net sales were below seasonal norms during the fourth quarter or during the easter season for any reason including merchandise delivery delays due to receiving or distribution problems changes in consumer sentiment or inclement weather fiscal 2012 consisted of 53 weeks commensurate with the retail calendar this extra week contributed approximately 125 million of sales in 2012 fiscal 2013 will consist of 52 weeks in fiscal 2013 there is one fewer weekend between thanksgiving and christmas compared to fiscal 2012 we believe this could potentially reduce the number of customer visits to our stores during the christmas selling season in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 

our unaudited results of operations for the eight most recent quarters are shown in a table in footnote 12 of the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

inflation and other economic factors 

our ability to provide quality merchandise at a fixed price and on a profitable basis may be subject to economic factors and influences that we cannot control consumer spending could decline because of economic pressures including unemployment and rising fuel prices reductions in consumer confidence and spending could have an adverse effect on our sales national or international events including war or terrorism could lead to disruptions in economies in the united states or in foreign countries these and other factors could increase our merchandise costs fuel costs and other costs that are critical to our operations such as shipping and wage rates 

shipping costs  currently transpacific shipping rates are negotiated with individual freight lines and are subject to fluctuation based on supply and demand for containers and current fuel costs  we can give no assurances as to the final rate trends for 2013  as we are in the early stages of our negotiations 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of our business including the impact of interest rate changes and diesel fuel cost changes we may enter into interest rate or diesel fuel swaps to manage exposure to interest rate and diesel fuel price changes we do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging and we do not hold derivative instruments for trading purposes 

diesel fuel cost risk 

in order to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in diesel fuel costs we entered into fuel derivative contracts with third parties we hedged 48 million  35 million  and 50 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2012  2011  and 2010 respectively these hedges represented approximately 35  31  and 39 of our total domestic truckload fuel needs in 2012  2011  and 2010 respectively we currently have fuel derivative contracts to hedge 07 million  gallons of diesel fuel or approximately 20  of our domestic truckload fuel needs from february 2013 through april 2013 under these contracts we pay the third party a fixed price for diesel fuel and receive variable diesel fuel prices at amounts approximating current diesel fuel costs thereby creating the economic equivalent of a fixedrate obligation these derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and therefore all changes in fair value for these derivatives are included in earnings the fair value of these contracts at february 2 2013  was an asset  of 05 million  

interest rate risk 

we use variablerate debt to finance certain of our operations and capital improvements these obligations expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates if interest rates increase interest expense increases conversely if interest rates decrease interest expense also decreases we believe it is beneficial to limit the variability of our interest payments 

to meet this objective we entered into derivative instruments in the form of two 750 million interest rate swaps in march 2008 to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in the variableinterest rates on a portion of our 2008 2500 million term loan the interest rate swaps reduced the interest rate exposure on these variablerate obligations under the interest rate swaps we paid the bank at a fixedrate and received variableinterest at a rate approximating the variablerate on the obligation thereby creating the economic equivalent of a fixedrate obligation these swaps expired in march 2011

 item 1 business 

overview 

we are the leading operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise at the fixed price of 100 we believe the variety and quality of products we sell for 100 sets us apart from our competitors at january 28 2012 we operated 4351 discount variety retail stores our stores operate under the names of dollar tree deal dollar tree deal dollar giant and dollar bills approximately 4168 of these stores sell substantially all items for 100 or less in the united states and 125cad or less in canada substantially all of the remaining stores operating as deal sell items for 100 or less but also sell items for more than 1 

we believe our optimal store size is between 8000 and 10000 selling square feet this store size provides the appropriate amount of space for our broad merchandise offerings while allowing us to provide great service to our customers as we have been expanding our merchandise offerings we have added freezers and coolers to approximately 2220 stores to increase sales and shopping frequency at february 2 2008 we operated 3411 stores in 48 states at january 28 2012 we operated 4252 stores in 48 states and the district of columbia as well as 99 stores in canada our selling square footage increased from approximately 284 million square feet in february 2008 to 376 million square feet in january 2012 our store growth has resulted primarily from opening new stores and the acquisition of dollar giant 

business strategy 

value merchandise offering  we strive to exceed our customers expectations of the variety and quality of products that they can purchase for 100 by offering items that we believe typically sell for higher prices elsewhere we buy approximately 58 to 60 of our merchandise domestically and import the remaining 40 to 42 our domestic purchases include basic seasonal closeouts and promotional merchandise we believe our mix of imported and domestic merchandise affords our buyers flexibility that allows them to consistently exceed the customers expectations in addition direct relationships with manufacturers permit us to select from a broad range of products and customize packaging product sizes and package quantities that meet our customers needs 

mix of basic variety and seasonal merchandise we maintain a balanced selection of products within traditional variety store categories we offer a wide selection of everyday basic products and we supplement these basic everyday items with seasonal closeout and promotional merchandise we attempt to keep certain basic consumable merchandise in our stores continuously to establish our stores as a destination and we have slightly increased the mix of consumable merchandise in order to increase the traffic in our stores closeout and promotional merchandise is purchased opportunistically and represents less than 10 of our purchases 

our merchandise mix consists of 

 

we have added freezers and coolers to certain stores and increased the amount of consumable merchandise carried by those stores we believe this initiative helps drive additional transactions and allows us to appeal to a broader demographic mix we have added freezers and coolers to 380 additional stores in 2011 therefore as of january 28 2012 we have freezers and coolers in 2220 of our stores we plan to add them to 325 more stores in 2012 as a result of the installation of freezers and coolers in select stores consumable merchandise has grown as a percentage of purchases and sales and we expect this trend to continue the following table shows the percentage of sales of each major product group for the years ended january 28 2012 and january 29 2011 

  

  

 

at any point in time we carry approximately 6200 items in our stores and as of the end of 2011 approximately 3400 of our basic everyday items are automatically replenished the remaining items are primarily ordered by our store managers on a weekly basis through automatic replenishment and our store managers’ ability to order product each store manager is able to satisfy the demands of their particular customer base 

customer payment methods all of our stores accept cash checks debit cards visa credit cards discover and american express and approximately 1140 stores accept mastercard credit cards  along with the shift to more consumables and the rollout of freezers and coolers we have increased the number of stores accepting electronic benefits transferebt cards and food stamps under the supplemental nutrition assistance program “snap” to approximately 3860 stores as of january 28 2012 

convenient locations and store size we primarily focus on opening new stores in strip shopping centers anchored by mass merchandisers or grocers whose target customers we believe to be similar to ours our stores have proven successful in metropolitan areas midsized cities and small towns the range of our store sizes allows us to target a particular location with a store that best suits that market and takes advantage of available real estate opportunities our stores are attractively designed and create an inviting atmosphere for shoppers by using bright lighting vibrant colors and decorative signs we enhance the store design with attractive merchandise displays we believe this design attracts new and repeat customers and enhances our image as both a destination and impulse purchase store 

for more information on retail locations and retail store leases see item 2 properties” beginning on page 13 of this form 10k 

profitable stores with strong cash flow we maintain a disciplined costsensitive approach to store site selection in order to minimize the initial capital investment required and maximize our potential to generate high operating margins and strong cash flows we believe that our stores have a relatively small shopping radius which allows us to profitably concentrate multiple stores within a single market our ability to open new stores is dependent upon among other factors locating suitable sites and negotiating favorable lease terms 

the strong cash flows generated by our stores allow us to selffund infrastructure investment and new stores over the past five years cash flows from operating activities have exceeded capital expenditures 

for more information on our results of operations see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” beginning on page 19 of this form 10k 

cost control  we believe that our substantial buying power at the 100 price point and our flexibility in making sourcing decisions contributes to our successful purchasing strategy which includes targeted merchandise margin goals by category we also believe our ability to select quality merchandise helps to minimize markdowns we buy products on an orderbyorder basis and have no material longterm purchase contracts or other assurances of continued product supply or guaranteed product cost no vendor accounted for more than 10 of total merchandise purchased in any of the past five years 

our supply chain systems continue to provide us with valuable sales information to assist our buyers and improve merchandise allocation to our stores controlling our inventory levels has resulted in more efficient distribution and store operations 

information systems we believe that investments in technology help us to increase sales and control costs our inventory management system has allowed us to improve the efficiency of our supply chain improve merchandise flow increase inventory turnover and control distribution and store operating costs our automatic replenishment system replenishes key items based on actual store level sales and inventory at the end of 2011 we had approximately 3400 basic everyday items on automatic replenishment 

pointofsale data allows us to track sales and inventory by merchandise category at the store level and assists us in planning for future purchases of inventory we believe that this information allows us to ship the appropriate product to stores at the quantities commensurate with selling patterns using this pointofsale data to plan purchases of inventory has helped us increase our inventory turns in each of the last five years our inventory turns were 42 in 2011 

  

  

corporate culture and values we believe that honesty and integrity doing the right things for the right reasons and treating people fairly and with respect are core values within our corporate culture we believe that running a business and certainly a public company carries with it a responsibility to be above reproach when making operational and financial decisions our executive management team visits and shops our stores like every customer and ideas and individual creativity on the part of our associates are encouraged particularly from our store managers who know their stores and their customers we have standards for store displays merchandise presentation and store operations we maintain an open door policy for all associates our distribution centers are operated based on objective measures of performance and virtually everyone in our store support center is available to assist associates in the stores and distribution centers 

our disclosure committee meets at least quarterly and monitors our internal controls over financial reporting to ensure that our public filings contain discussions about the risks our business faces we believe that we have the controls in place to be able to certify our financial statements additionally we have complied with the listing requirements for the nasdaq stock market 

growth strategy 

store openings and square footage growth the primary factors contributing to our net sales growth have been new store openings an active store expansion and remodel program and selective mergers and acquisitions in the last five years net sales increased at a compound annual growth rate of 118 we expect that the majority of our future sales growth will come primarily from new store openings and from our store expansion and relocation program 

the following table shows the average selling square footage of our stores and the selling square footage per new store opened over the last five years our growth and productivity statistics are reported based on selling square footage because our management believes the use of selling square footage yields a more accurate measure of store productivity 

  

 

we expect to increase our selling square footage in the future by opening new stores in underserved markets and strategically increasing our presence in our existing markets via new store openings and store expansions expansions include store relocations in fiscal 2011 and beyond we plan to predominantly open stores that are approximately 8000  10000 selling square feet and we believe this size allows us to achieve our objectives in the markets in which we plan to expand at january 28 2012 approximately 2360 of our stores totaling 654 of our selling square footage were 8000 selling square feet or larger  

we also continue to grow our deal format which offers an expanded assortment of merchandise including items that sell for more than 100 these stores provide us an opportunity to leverage our dollar tree infrastructure in different merchandise concepts including higher price points without disrupting the singleprice point model in our dollar tree stores we operated 182 deal stores as of january 28 2012 

in addition to new store openings we plan to continue our store expansion program to increase our net sales per store and take advantage of market opportunities we target stores for expansion based on the current sales per selling square foot and changes in market opportunities stores targeted for expansion are generally less than 6000 selling square feet in size store expansions generally increase the existing store size by approximately 3700 selling square feet 

  

  

since 1995 we have added a total of 695 stores through several mergers and acquisitions our acquisition strategy has been to target companies that have a similar singleprice point concept that have shown success in operations or companies that provide a strategic advantage we evaluate potential acquisition opportunities in our retail sector as they become available 

in november 2010 we completed our acquisition of 86 dollar giant stores based in vancouver british columbia these stores offer a wide assortment of quality general merchandise contemporary seasonal goods and everyday consumables all priced at 125 cad or less the stores that we acquired operated in the canadian provinces of british columbia ontario alberta and saskatchewan and we now also have a store in manitoba this is the first expansion of our retail operations outside of the united states and provides us with a proven management team and distribution network as well as additional potential store growth in a new market 

from time to time we also acquire the rights to store leases through bankruptcy or other proceedings we will continue to take advantage of these opportunities as they arise depending upon several factors including their fit within our location and selling square footage size parameters 

merchandising and distribution expanding our customer base is important to our growth plans we plan to continue to stock our new stores with a compelling mix of everchanging merchandise that our current customers have come to appreciate consumable merchandise typically leads to more frequent return trips to our stores resulting in increased sales the presentation and display of merchandise in our stores are critical to communicating value to our customers and creating a more exciting shopping experience we believe our approach to visual merchandising results in higher sales volume and an environment that encourages impulse purchases 

a strong and efficient distribution network is critical to our ability to grow and to maintain a lowcost operating structure in 2011 we expanded our savannah distribution center to 10 million square feet in 2009 we purchased a new distribution center in san bernardino california which began shipping merchandise in april 2010 this distribution center replaced the salt lake city distribution center which closed when its lease expired in april 2010 we believe our distribution center network is currently capable of supporting approximately 80 billion in annual sales in the united states new distribution sites like this one in san bernardino california are strategically located to reduce stem miles maintain flexibility and improve efficiency in our store service areas in 2012 we plan to begin construction on a new distribution center in the northeast which is expected to begin shipping product in 2013 we also are a party to an agreement which provides distribution services from two facilities in canada 

our stores receive approximately 90 of their inventory from our distribution centers via contract carriers the remaining store inventory primarily perishable consumable items and other vendormaintained display items are delivered directly to our stores from vendors for more information on our distribution center network see item 2 “properties” beginning on page 13 of this form 10k 

competition 

the retail industry is highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future we operate in the discount retail merchandise business which is currently and is expected to continue to be highly competitive with respect to price store location merchandise quality assortment and presentation and customer service our competitors include singleprice dollar stores multiprice dollar stores mass merchandisers discount retailers and variety retailers in addition several competitors have locations with dollar price point merchandise in their stores which increases competition we believe we differentiate ourselves from other retailers by providing high value high quality low cost merchandise in attractively designed stores that are conveniently located our sales and profits could be reduced by increases in competition there are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector 

trademarks 

we are the owners of several federal service mark registrations including dollar tree the dollar tree logo the dollar tree logo with a “1” and one priceone dollar in addition we own a concurrent use registration for dollar bill and the related logo we also acquired the rights to use trade names previously owned by everythings a dollar a former competitor in the 100 price point industry several trade names were included in the purchase including the marks everythings 100 we mean everything and everythings 100 with the acquisition of deal we became the owners of the trademark “deal” with the acquisition of dollar giant we became the owners of the trademark “dollar giant” and others in canada   we have federal trademark registrations for a variety of private labels that we use to market some of our product lines our trademark registrations have various expiration dates however assuming that the trademark registrations are properly renewed they have a perpetual duration 

  

  

employees 

we employed approximately 14170 fulltime and 58600 parttime associates on january 28 2012 parttime associates work an average of less than 35 hours per week the number of parttime associates fluctuates depending on seasonal needs we consider our relationship with our associates to be good and we have not experienced significant interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements 




 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk any failure to meet market expectations including our comparable store sales growth rate earnings and earnings per share or new store openings could cause the market price of our stock to decline you should carefully consider the specific risk factors listed below together with all other information included or incorporated in this report any of the following risks may materialize and additional risks not known to us or that we now deem immaterial may arise in such event our business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected 

our profitability is vulnerable to cost increases 

future increase in costs such as the cost of merchandise wage and benefit costs shipping rates freight costs fuel costs and store occupancy costs may reduce our profitability we do not raise the sales price of our merchandise to offset cost increases because we are committed to selling primarily at the 100 price point to continue to provide value to the customer we are dependent on our ability to adjust our product assortment to operate more efficiently or effectively or to increase our comparable store net sales in order to offset inflation we can give no assurance that we will be able to operate more efficiently or increase our comparable store net sales in the future please see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations beginning on page 19 of this form 10k for further discussion of the effect of inflation and other economic factors on our operations 

litigation may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to the risk of litigation involving employees consumers suppliers competitors shareholders government agencies or others through private actions class actions administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation we are currently defendants in several employmentrelated class action cases and changes in federal law could cause these types of claims to rise the outcome of litigation particularly class action lawsuits regulatory actions and intellectual property claims is difficult to assess or quantify plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to these lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time in addition certain of these lawsuits if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in liability material to our financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operation are required the cost to defend current and future litigation may be significant there also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation including litigation related to product safety and customer information which could negatively affect customer perception of our business regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable 

for a discussion of current legal matters please see item 3 “legal proceedings” beginning on page 14 of this form 10k resolution of certain matters described in that item if decided against the company could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations accrued liabilities or cash flows 

changes in federal state or local law or our failure to comply with such laws could increase our expenses and expose us to legal risks 

our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations significant legislative changes such as the healthcare legislation that impact our relationship with our workforce could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations changes in other regulatory areas such as consumer credit privacy and information security product safety or environmental protection among others could cause our expenses to increase in addition if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations particularly wage and hour laws we could be subject to legal risk including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation which could adversely affect our results of operations changes in tax laws the interpretation of existing laws or our failure to sustain our reporting positions on examination could adversely affect our effective tax rate 

  

  

our growth is dependent on our ability to increase sales in existing stores and to expand our square footage profitably 

existing store sales growth is dependent on a variety of factors including merchandise selection and availability store operations and customer satisfaction in addition competition could affect our sales our highest sales periods are the christmas and easter seasons and we generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and our operating and net income during the fourth quarter in anticipation we stock extra inventory and hire many temporary employees to prepare our stores a reduction in sales during these periods could adversely affect our operating results particularly operating and net income to a greater extent than if a reduction occurred at other times of the year untimely merchandise delays due to receiving or distribution problems could have a similar effect easter was observed on april 4 2010 april 24 2011 and will be observed on april 8 2012 

expanding our square footage profitably depends on a number of uncertainties including our ability to locate lease build out and open or expand stores in suitable locations on a timely basis under favorable economic terms in addition our expansion is dependent upon thirdparty developers’ abilities to acquire land obtain financing and secure necessary permits and approvals turmoil in the financial markets has made it difficult for third party developers to obtain financing for new projects we also open or expand stores within our established geographic markets where new or expanded stores may draw sales away from our existing stores we may not manage our expansion effectively and our failure to achieve our expansion plans could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks associated with our domestic and foreign suppliers from whom our products are sourced could affect our financial performance 

we are dependent on our vendors to supply merchandise in a timely and efficient manner if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments due to financial or other difficulties we could experience merchandise shortages which could lead to lost sales or increased merchandise costs if alternative sources must be used 

merchandise imported directly accounts for approximately 40 to 42 of our total retail value purchases in addition we believe that a portion of our goods purchased from domestic vendors is imported china is the source of a substantial majority of our imports imported goods are generally less expensive than domestic goods and increase our profit margins a disruption in the flow of our imported merchandise or an increase in the cost of those goods may significantly decrease our profits risks associated with our reliance on imported goods may include disruptions in the flow of or increases in the cost of imported goods because of factors such as 

 

 

 

 

we could encounter disruptions in our distribution network or additional costs in distributing merchandise 

our success is dependent on our ability to transport merchandise to our distribution centers and then ship it to our stores in a timely and costeffective manner we may not anticipate respond to or control all of the challenges of operating our receiving and distribution systems additionally if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments we could experience merchandise shortages that could lead to lost sales or increased costs some of the factors that could have an adverse effect on our distribution network or costs are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

a downturn in economic conditions could impact our sales 

deterioration in economic conditions such as those caused by a recession inflation higher unemployment consumer debt levels lack of available credit cost increases as well as adverse weather conditions or terrorism could reduce consumer spending or cause customers to shift their spending to products we either do not sell or do not sell as profitably adverse economic conditions could disrupt consumer spending and significantly reduce our sales decrease our inventory turnover cause greater markdowns or reduce our profitability due to lower margins 

our profitability is affected by the mix of products we sell 

our gross profit margin could decrease if we increase the proportion of higher cost goods we sell in the future in recent years the percentage of our sales from higher cost consumable products has increased and is likely to increase in 2012 as a result our gross profit margin could decrease unless we are able to maintain our current merchandise cost sufficiently to offset any decrease in our product margin percentage we can give no assurance that we will be able to do so 

pressure from competitors may reduce our sales and profits 

the retail industry is highly competitive the marketplace is highly fragmented as many different retailers compete for market share by utilizing a variety of store formats and merchandising strategies we expect competition to increase in the future there are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector some of our current or potential competitors have greater financial resources than we do we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors please see item 1 “business” beginning on page x of this form 10k for further discussion of the effect of competition on our operations 

a significant disruption in or security breach in our computer systems could adversely affect our operations or our ability to secure customer employee and company data 

we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory process customer transactions and summarize results systems may be subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunication failures computer viruses security breaches and catastrophic events if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process customer transactions which could aversely affect our results of operations 

the protection of customer employee and company data is increasingly demanding with frequent imposition of new requirements across our business in addition our customers have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information a significant breach of customer employee or company data could damage our reputation and result in lost sales fines andor lawsuits 

  

  

our business could be adversely affected if we fail to attract and retain qualified associates and key personnel 

our growth and performance is dependent on the skills experience and contributions of our associates executives and key personnel various factors including overall labor availability wage rates regulatory or legislative impacts and benefit costs could impact the ability to attract and retain qualified associates at our stores distribution centers and corporate office 

certain provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws could delay or discourage a takeover attempt that may be in a shareholders best interest 

  

our articles of incorporation and bylaws currently contain provisions that may delay or discourage a takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider in his best interest these provisions among other things 

 

 

 

however we believe that these provisions allow our board of directors to negotiate a higher price in the event of a takeover attempt which would be in the best interest of our shareholders 

in 2010 the shareholders approved an amendment to our articles of incorporation which will result in the declassification of our board of directors in 2012

stores 

as of january 28 2012 we operated 4351 stores in 48 states and the district of columbia as well as the canadian provinces of british columbia ontario alberta saskatchewan and manitoba as detailed below 

 

  

  

we lease the vast majority of our stores and expect to lease the majority of our new stores as we expand our leases typically provide for a short initial lease term generally five years with options to extend however in some cases we have initial lease terms of seven to ten years we believe this leasing strategy enhances our flexibility to pursue various expansion opportunities resulting from changing market conditions as current leases expire we believe that we will be able to obtain lease renewals if desired for present store locations or to obtain leases for equivalent or better locations in the same general area 

distribution centers 

the following table includes information about the distribution centers that we own and operate in the united states in 2011 we expanded our savannah distribution center to 10 million square feet in 2009 we purchased a new distribution center in san bernardino california which began shipping merchandise in april 2010 this facility replaced the salt lake city distribution center which closed when its lease expired in april 2010 we believe our distribution center network is currently capable of supporting approximately 80 billion in annual sales in the united states in 2012 we plan to begin construction on a new distribution center in the northeast which is expected to begin shipping product in 2013 

 

each of our distribution centers contains advanced materials handling technologies including radiofrequency inventory tracking equipment and specialized information systems with the exception of our ridgefield facility each of our distribution centers in the united states also contains automated conveyor and sorting systems 

we are also a party to an agreement which provides distribution services from facilities in british columbia and ontario 

for more information on financing of our distribution centers see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations funding requirements beginning on page 19 of this form 10k 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

from time to time we are defendants in ordinary routine litigation or proceedings incidental to our business including allegations regarding 

 

 

in 2006 a former store manager filed a collective action against us in alabama federal court she claims that she and other store managers should have been classified as nonexempt employees under the fair labor standards act and received overtime compensation the court preliminarily allowed nationwide except california certification at present approximately 265 individuals are included in the collective action our motion to decertify the collective action was dismissed without prejudice in 2010 we filed another motion to decertify on february 29 2012 there is no scheduled trial date 

 

  

  

in 2009 34 plaintiffs filed a class action complaint in a federal court in virginia alleging gender pay and promotion discrimination under title vii in 2010 the case was dismissed with prejudice plaintiffs appealed to the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit the appeal has been fully briefed by the parties and oral arguments were conducted in january 2012 the parties await a decision of the appellate court which is expected by late spring or summer of 2012 

 

in april 2011 a former assistant store manager on behalf of himself and those similarly situated instituted a class action in a california state court primarily alleging a failure by us to provide meal breaks to compensate for all hours worked and to pay overtime compensation we removed the case to federal court which denied plaintiffs’ motion for remand of the case to state court the case presently awaits a scheduling order there is no trial date 

 

in june 2011 winndixie stores inc and various of its affiliates instituted suit in federal court in florida alleging that we in approximately 48 shopping centers in the state of florida and five other states where dollar tree and winndixie are both tenants are selling goods and products in dollar tree stores in violation of an exclusive right of winndixie to sell and distribute such items it seeks both monetary damages and injunctive relief at approximately the same time winndixie also sued dollar general inc and big lots inc making essentially the same allegations against them and seeking the same relief the court consolidated the three cases and they are set for trial on may 7 2012 

 

in the summer and fall of 2011 collective action lawsuits were filed against us in six federal courts by different assistant store managers each alleging he or she was forced to work off the clock in violation of the fair labor standards act the suits were filed in georgia colorado florida michigan illinois and maryland the maryland case has since been dismissed in all of the remaining cases plaintiffs also assert various state law claims for which they seek class treatment the georgia suit seeks statewide class certification for those assistant managers similarly situated during the relevant time periods and the florida colorado michigan and illinois cases seek nationwide certifications for those assistant store managers similarly situated during the relevant time periods the illinois case also includes a purported class of all other hourly store associates making the same allegations on their behalf we have commenced our investigation and have filed motions to dismiss and motions to transfer venue to the eastern district of virginia in all cases no rulings on these motions have been made to date the plaintiffs filed a motion with the federal court multidistrict litigation panel to consolidate all these and other related cases and that motion was denied to date the only cases in which class certification motions have been filed are in the illinois and colorado actions none of the cases have been assigned a trial date 

 

we will vigorously defend ourselves in these matters we do not believe that any of these matters will individually or in the aggregate have a material effect on our business or financial condition we cannot give assurance however that one or more of these lawsuits will not have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which they are resolved based on the information available including the amount of time remaining before trial the results of discovery and the judgment of internal and external counsel we are unable to express an opinion as to the outcome of those matters which are not settled and cannot estimate a potential range of loss on the outstanding matters

key events and recent developments 

several key events have had or are expected to have a significant effect on our operations you should keep in mind that 

 

  

  

overview 

our net sales are derived from the sale of merchandise two major factors tend to affect our net sales trends first is our success at opening new stores or adding new stores through acquisitions second sales vary at our existing stores from one year to the next we refer to this change as a change in comparable store net sales because we compare only those stores that are open throughout both of the periods being compared we include sales from stores expanded during the year in the calculation of comparable store net sales which has the effect of increasing our comparable store net sales the term expanded also includes stores that are relocated 

at january 28 2012 we operated 4351 stores in 48 states and the district of columbia as well as the canadian provinces of british columbia ontario alberta saskatchewan and manitoba with 376 million selling square feet compared to 4101 stores with 351 million selling square feet at january 29 2011 during fiscal 2011 we opened 278 stores expanded 91 stores and closed 28 stores compared to 235 new stores opened 95 stores expanded 86 stores acquired and 26 stores closed during fiscal 2010 in the current year we increased our selling square footage by 69 of the 24 million selling square foot increase in 2011 03 million was added by expanding existing stores the average size of our stores opened in 2011 was approximately 8360 selling square feet or about 10280 gross square feet for 2012 we continue to plan to open stores that are approximately 8000  10000 selling square feet or about 10000  12000 gross square feet we believe that this store size is our optimal size operationally and that this size also gives our customers an ideal shopping environment that invites them to shop longer and buy more 

in fiscal 2011 comparable store net sales increased by 60 the comparable store net sales increase was the result of a 48 increase in the number of transactions and a 12 increase in average ticket we believe comparable store net sales continued to be positively affected by a number of our initiatives as debit and credit card penetration continued to increase in 2011 and we continued the rollout of frozen and refrigerated merchandise to more of our stores at january 28 2012 we had frozen and refrigerated merchandise in approximately 2220 stores compared to approximately 1840 stores at january 29 2011 we believe that the addition of frozen and refrigerated product enables us to increase sales and earnings by increasing the number of shopping trips made by our customers in addition we accept food stamps under the supplemental nutrition assistance program “snap” in approximately 3860 qualified stores compared to 3500 at the end of 2010 

with the pressures of the current economic environment we have seen continued demand for basic consumable products in 2011 as a result we have continued to shift the mix of inventory carried in our stores to more consumer product merchandise which we believe increases the traffic in our stores and has helped to increase our sales even during the current economic downturn while this shift in mix has impacted our merchandise costs we were able to offset that impact in the current year with decreased costs for merchandise in many of our categories 

our pointofsale technology provides us with valuable sales and inventory information to assist our buyers and improve our merchandise allocation to our stores we believe that this has enabled us to better manage our inventory flow resulting in more efficient distribution and store operations and increased inventory turnover for each of the last five years 

  

in 2007 legislation was enacted that increased the federal minimum wage the last increase to 725 an hour was effective in july 2009 as a result our wages increased in the third quarter of 2009 through the first half of 2010 compared with the comparable period in the prior year however we offset the increase in payroll costs through increased productivity and continued efficiencies in product flow to our stores 

we must continue to control our merchandise costs inventory levels and our general and administrative expenses as increases in these line items could negatively impact our operating results 

  

  

results of operations 

the following table expresses items from our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales on january 31 2010 the first day of fiscal 2010 we began using approximately 30 inventory pools in our retail inventory calculation rather than one inventory pool as we had done since our inception as a result of this change we recorded a nonrecurring noncash charge to gross profit and a corresponding reduction in inventory at cost of 263 million in the first quarter of 2010 

 

fiscal year ended january 28 2012 compared to fiscal year ended january 29 2011 

net sales  net sales increased 127 or 7480 million in 2011 compared to 2010 resulting from sales in our new stores and a 60 increase in comparable store net sales comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores which we include in the calculation and to a lesser extent are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing ones 

the following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store count for fiscal years ended january 28 2012 and january 29 2011 

 

of the 24 million selling square foot increase in 2011 approximately 03 million was added by expanding existing stores 

 

 

 

 

selling general and administrative expenses  selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 241 for 2011 compared to 248 for 2010 the decrease is primarily due to the following 

 

 

  

  

operating income  operating income margin was 118 in 2011 compared to 107 in 2010 excluding the 263 million noncash adjustment to beginning inventory operating income margin was 111 in 2010 due to the reasons noted above operating income margin excluding this charge improved 70 basis points 

income taxes  our effective tax rate was 374 in 2011 and 369 in 2010 

fiscal year ended january 29 2011 compared to fiscal year ended january 30 2010 

net sales  net sales increased 124 or 6512 million in 2010 compared to 2009 resulting from a 63 increase in comparable store net sales and sales in our new stores comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores which we include in the calculation and to a lesser extent are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing ones 

the following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store count for fiscal years ended january 29 2011 and january 30 2010 

 

of the 29 million selling square foot increase in 2010 approximately 04 million was added by expanding existing stores and 07 million was the result of the acquisition of the dollar giant stores 

gross profit margin was 355 in 2010 and 2009 excluding the effect of the 263 million noncash beginning inventory adjustment gross profit margin increased to 359 this increase was due to the net of the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

selling general and administrative expenses  selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 248 for 2010 compared to 257 for 2009 the decrease is primarily due to the following 

 

operating income  operating income margin was 107 in 2010 compared to 98 in 2009 excluding the 263 million noncash adjustment to beginning inventory operating income margin was 111 due to the reasons noted above operating income margin excluding this charge improved 130 basis points 

income taxes  our effective tax rate was 369 in 2010 and 2009 

liquidity and capital resources 

our business requires capital to build and open new stores expand our distribution network and operate and expand existing stores our working capital requirements for existing stores are seasonal and usually reach their peak in september and october historically we have satisfied our seasonal working capital requirements for existing stores and have funded our store opening and distribution network expansion programs from internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities 

  

  

the following table compares cashflow related information for the years ended january 28 2012 january 29 2011 and january 30 2010 

 

  

net cash provided by operating activities increased 1678 million in 2011 compared to 2010 due to increased earnings before income taxes depreciation and amortization in the current year a decrease in cash used to purchase merchandise inventories and an increase in other current liabilities due to increases in sales tax collected and accrued expenses 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased 623 million in 2010 compared to 2009 due to an increase in cash used to purchase merchandise inventories partially offset by increased earnings before income taxes depreciation and amortization in the current year 

net cash used in investing activities decreased 2880 million in 2011 primarily due to an additional 1700 million of proceeds from the sale of shortterm investments with minimal purchases of shortterm investments compared to 1578 million of purchases in 2010 the proceeds were used to fund the share repurchases in 2011 in addition in 2010 we used 494 million to acquire dollar giant these increased sources of cash were partially offset by a 714 million increase in capital expenditures in 2011 due to funds for new store projects and the expansion of our distribution center in savannah georgia 

net cash used in investing activities increased 1616 million in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to shortterm investment activity and the dollar giant acquisition in 2010 we purchased 1578 million of shortterm investments compared to 278 million in 2009 this was partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the sales of shortterm investments of 108 million in 2010 

in 2011 net cash used in financing activities increased 2189 million as a result of increased share repurchases in 2011 

in 2010 net cash used in financing activities increased 2430 million as a result of increased share repurchases in 2010 and payments of 138 million for debt acquired from dollar giant

funding requirements 

overview including offbalance sheet arrangements 

we expect our cash needs for opening new stores and expanding existing stores in fiscal 2012 to total approximately 2059   million which includes capital expenditures initial inventory and preopening costs 

our estimated capital expenditures for fiscal 2012 are between 3300 and 3400 million including planned expenditures for our new and expanded stores the addition of freezers and coolers to approximately 325 stores and approximately 800 million to construct a new distribution center in the northeast united states we believe that we can adequately fund our working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures for the next few years from net cash provided by operations and potential borrowings under our existing credit facility 

the following tables summarize our material contractual obligations at january 28 2012 including both on and offbalance sheet arrangements and our commitments including interest on longterm borrowings in millions

interest on longterm borrowings this amount represents interest payments on the credit agreement and the revenue bond financing using the interest rates for each at january 28 2012

in march 2008 we entered into two 750 million interest rate swap agreements these interest rate swaps were used to manage the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations on a portion of our 2500 million variable rate term loan under these agreements we paid interest to financial institutions at a fixed rate of 28 in exchange the financial institutions paid us at a variable rate which approximated the variable rate on the debt excluding the credit spread these swaps qualified for hedge accounting treatment and expired in march 2011 

in 2011 we were party to fuel derivative contracts with third parties which included approximately 35 million gallons of diesel fuel or approximately 31 of our domestic truckload fuel needs these derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and therefore all changes in fair value for these derivatives are included in earnings we currently have fuel derivative contracts to hedge 28 million gallons of diesel fuel or approximately 41 of our domestic truckload fuel needs from february 2012 through july 2012 and 05 million gallons of diesel fuel or approximately 16 of our domestic truckload fuel needs from august 2012 through october 2012 

  

  

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates certain of our estimates require a high level of judgment and have the potential to have a material effect on the financial statements if actual results vary significantly   from those estimates following is a discussion of the estimates that we consider critical 

inventory valuation 

as discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weightedaverage basis cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weightedaverage basis under the retail inventory method the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated costtoretail ratio to the retail value of inventories from our inception and through fiscal 2009 we used one inventory pool for this calculation because of our investments over the years in our retail technology systems we were able to refine our estimate of inventory cost under the retail method and on january 31 2010 the first day of fiscal 2010 we began using approximately 30 inventory pools in our retail inventory calculation as a result of this change we recorded a nonrecurring noncash charge to gross profit and a corresponding reduction in inventory at cost of approximately 263 million in the first quarter of 2010 the retail inventory method is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis 

inventory valuation methods require certain significant management estimates and judgments including estimates of future merchandise markdowns and shrink which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins the averaging required in applying the retail inventory method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns could under certain circumstances result in costs not being recorded in the proper period 

we estimate our markdown reserve based on the consideration of a variety of factors including but not limited to quantities of slow moving or seasonal carryover merchandise on hand historical markdown statistics and future merchandising plans the accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors some of which are outside of our control including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends historically we have not experienced significant differences in our estimated reserve for markdowns compared with actual results 

our accrual for shrink is based on the actual historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories adjusted if necessary for current economic conditions and business trends these estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger our physical inventory counts are generally taken between january and september of each year therefore the shrink accrual recorded at january 28 2012 is based on estimated shrink for most of 2011 including the fourth quarter we have not experienced significant fluctuations in historical shrink rates beyond approximately 1020 basis points in our dollar tree stores for the last few years however we have sometimes experienced higher than typical shrink in acquired stores in the year following an acquisition we periodically adjust our shrink estimates to address these factors as they become apparent 

our management believes that our application of the retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market each year on a consistent basis 

accrued expenses 

on a monthly basis we estimate certain expenses in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred our most material estimates include domestic freight expenses selfinsurance costs storelevel operating expenses such as property taxes and utilities and certain other expenses such as legal reserves our freight and storelevel operating expenses are estimated based on current activity and historical trends and results our workers compensation and general liability insurance accruals are recorded based on actuarial valuations which are adjusted at least annually based on a review performed by a thirdparty actuary these actuarial valuations are estimates based on our historical loss development factors certain other expenses are estimated and recorded in the periods that management becomes aware of them the related accruals are adjusted as management’s estimates change differences in managements estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual materially different from the calculated accrual our experience has been that some of our estimates are too high and others are too low historically the net total of these differences has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations our legal proceedings are described in item 3 “legal proceedings” beginning on page 14 of this form 10k the outcome of litigation particularly class or collective action lawsuits is difficult to assess quantify or predict 

  

  

income taxes 

on a quarterly basis we estimate our required income tax liability and assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets our income taxes payable are estimated based on enacted tax rates including estimated tax rates in states where our store base is growing applied to the income expected to be taxed currently management assesses the recoverability of deferred tax assets based on the availability of carrybacks of future deductible amounts and management’s projections for future taxable income we cannot guarantee that we will generate taxable income in future years historically we have not experienced significant differences in our estimates of our tax accrual 

in addition we have a recorded liability for our estimate of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns judgment is required in evaluating the application of federal and state tax laws including relevant case law and assessing whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination and if so judgment is also required as to the measurement of the amount of tax benefit that will be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or the final outcome differs from the amounts recorded we believe that our liability for uncertain tax positions is adequate for further discussion of our changes in reserves during 2011 see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data  note 3 to the consolidated financial statements” beginning on page 40 of this form 10k 

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations 

we experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales comparable store net sales operating income and net income and expect this trend to continue our results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors including 

 

our highest sales periods are the christmas and easter seasons easter was observed on april 4 2010 april 24 2011 and will be observed on april 8 2012 we believe that the earlier easter in 2012 could result in an 80 million decrease in sales in the first quarter of 2012 as compared to the first quarter of 2011 we generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and of our operating and net income during the fourth quarter in anticipation of increased sales activity during these months we purchase substantial amounts of inventory and hire a significant number of temporary employees to supplement our continuing store staff our operating results particularly operating and net income could suffer if our net sales were below seasonal norms during the fourth quarter or during the easter season for any reason including merchandise delivery delays due to receiving or distribution problems changes in consumer sentiment or inclement weather 

our unaudited results of operations for the eight most recent quarters are shown in a table in footnote 11 of the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

inflation and other economic factors 

our ability to provide quality merchandise at a fixed price and on a profitable basis may be subject to economic factors and influences that we cannot control consumer spending could decline because of economic pressures including unemployment and rising fuel prices reductions in consumer confidence and spending could have an adverse effect on our sales national or international events including war or terrorism could lead to disruptions in economies in the united states or in foreign countries these and other factors could increase our merchandise costs fuel costs and other costs that are critical to our operations such as shipping and wage rates 

  

  

shipping costs  currently transpacific shipping rates are negotiated with individual freight lines and are subject to fluctuation based on supply and demand for containers and current fuel costs  we can give no assurances as to the final rate trends for 2012 as we are in the early stages of our negotiations 

minimum wage in 2007 legislation was enacted that increased the federal minimum wage from 515 an hour to 725 an hour over a two year period with the final increase being enacted in july 2009 as a result our wages increased in 2009 and through the first half of 2010 compared with the prior year periods however we offset the increase in payroll costs through increased productivity and continued efficiencies in product flow to our stores 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of our business including the impact of interest rate changes and diesel fuel cost changes we may enter into interest rate or diesel fuel swaps to manage exposure to interest rate and diesel fuel price changes we do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging and we do not hold derivative instruments for trading purposes 

interest rate risk 

  we use variablerate debt to finance certain of our operations and capital improvements these obligations expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates if interest rates increase interest expense increases conversely if interest rates decrease interest expense also decreases we believe it is beneficial to limit the variability of our interest payments 

to meet this objective we entered into derivative instruments in the form of interest rate swaps to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in the variableinterest rates on a portion of our 2500 million term loan the interest rate swaps reduced the interest rate exposure on these variablerate obligations under the interest rate swaps we paid the bank at a fixedrate and received variableinterest at a rate approximating the variablerate on the obligation thereby creating the economic equivalent of a fixedrate obligation we entered into two 750 million interest rate swap agreements in march 2008 to manage the risk associated with the interest rate fluctuations on a portion of our 2500 million variable rate term loan these swaps expired in march 2011 

diesel fuel cost risk 

in order to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in diesel fuel costs we entered into fuel derivative contracts with third parties we hedged 35 million and 50 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2011 and 2010 respectively these hedges represented approximately 31 and 39 of our total domestic truckload fuel needs in 2011 and 2010 respectively we currently have fuel derivative contracts to hedge 28 million gallons of diesel fuel or approximately 41 of our domestic truckload fuel needs from february 2012 through july 2012 and 05 million gallons of diesel fuel or approximately 16 of our domestic truckload fuel needs from august 2012 through october 2012 under these contracts we pay the third party a fixed price for diesel fuel and receive variable diesel fuel prices at amounts approximating current diesel fuel costs thereby creating the economic equivalent of a fixedrate obligation these derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and therefore all changes in fair value for these derivatives are included in earnings the fair value of these contracts at january 28 2012 was an asset of 06 million

 item 1 business 

overview 

we are the leading operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise at the fixed price of 100 we believe the variety and quality of products we sell for 100 sets us apart from our competitors at january 29 2011 we operated 4101 discount variety retail stores our stores operate under the names of dollar tree deal dollar tree deal dollar giant and dollar bills approximately 3935 of these stores sell substantially all items for 100 or less in the united states and 125 or less in canada substantially all of the remaining stores operating as deal sell items for 100 or less but also sell items for more than 1 

we believe our optimal store is between 8000 and 10000 selling square feet this store size provides the appropriate amount of space for our broad merchandise offerings while allowing us to provide great service to our customers as we have been expanding our merchandise offerings we have added freezers and coolers to approximately 1840 stores to increase sales and shopping frequency at february 3 2007 we operated 3219 stores in 48 states at january 29 2011 we operated 4015 stores in 48 states and the district of columbia as well as 86 stores in canada our selling square footage increased from approximately 263 million square feet in february 2007 to 351 million square feet in january 2011 our store growth has resulted primarily from opening new stores with additional growth from mergers and acquisitions such as deal and dollar giant 

business strategy 

value merchandise offering  we strive to exceed our customers expectations of the variety and quality of products that they can purchase for 100 by offering items that we believe typically sell for higher prices elsewhere we buy approximately 55 to 60 of our merchandise domestically and import the remaining 40 to 45 our domestic purchases include closeouts and promotional merchandise we believe our mix of imported and domestic merchandise affords our buyers flexibility that allows them to consistently exceed the customers expectations in addition direct relationships with manufacturers permit us to select from a broad range of products and customize packaging product sizes and package quantities that meet our customers needs 

mix of basic variety and seasonal merchandise we maintain a balanced selection of products within traditional variety store categories we offer a wide selection of everyday basic products and we supplement these basic everyday items with seasonal closeout and promotional merchandise we attempt to keep certain basic consumable merchandise in our stores continuously to establish our stores as a destination and we have slightly increased the mix of consumable merchandise in order to increase the traffic in our stores closeout and promotional merchandise is purchased opportunistically and represents less than 10 of our purchases 

our merchandise mix consists of 

 

we have added freezers and coolers to certain stores and increased the amount of consumable merchandise carried by those stores we believe this initiative helps drive additional transactions and allows us to appeal to a broader demographic mix we have added freezers and coolers to approximately 420 additional stores in 2010 therefore as of january 29 2011 we have freezers and coolers in approximately 1840 of our stores we plan to add them to approximately 225 more stores in 2011 as a result of the installation of freezers and coolers in select stores consumable merchandise has grown as a percentage of purchases and sales and we expect this trend to continue the following table shows the percentage of sales of each major product group for the years ended january 29 2011 and january 30 2010 

  

  

 

at any point in time we carry approximately 6100 items in our stores and as of the end of 2010 approximately 2700 of our basic everyday items are automatically replenished the remaining items are primarily ordered by our store managers on a weekly basis through automatic replenishment and our store managers’ ability to order product each store manager is able to satisfy the demands of their particular customer base 

customer payment methods all of our stores accept cash checks debit cards visa credit cards discover and american express and approximately 950 stores accept mastercard credit cards  along with the shift to more consumables and the rollout of freezers and coolers we have increased the number of stores accepting electronic benefits transferebt cards and food stamps under the supplemental nutrition assistance program “snap” to approximately 3500 stores as of january 29 2011 

convenient locations and store size we primarily focus on opening new stores in strip shopping centers anchored by mass merchandisers or grocers whose target customers we believe to be similar to ours our stores have proven successful in metropolitan areas midsized cities and small towns the range of our store sizes allows us to target a particular location with a store that best suits that market and takes advantage of available real estate opportunities our stores are attractively designed and create an inviting atmosphere for shoppers by using bright lighting vibrant colors and decorative signs we enhance the store design with attractive merchandise displays we believe this design attracts new and repeat customers and enhances our image as both a destination and impulse purchase store 

for more information on retail locations and retail store leases see item 2 properties” beginning on page 13 of this form 10k 

profitable stores with strong cash flow we maintain a disciplined costsensitive approach to store site selection in order to minimize the initial capital investment required and maximize our potential to generate high operating margins and strong cash flows we believe that our stores have a relatively small shopping radius which allows us to profitably concentrate multiple stores within a single market our ability to open new stores is dependent upon among other factors locating suitable sites and negotiating favorable lease terms 

the strong cash flows generated by our stores allow us to selffund infrastructure investment and new stores over the past five years cash flows from operating activities have exceeded capital expenditures 

for more information on our results of operations see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” beginning on page 19 of this form 10k 

cost control  we believe that our substantial buying power at the 100 price point and our flexibility in making sourcing decisions contributes to our successful purchasing strategy which includes disciplined targeted merchandise margin goals by category we also believe our ability to select quality merchandise helps to minimize markdowns we buy products on an orderbyorder basis and have no material longterm purchase contracts or other assurances of continued product supply or guaranteed product cost no vendor accounted for more than 10 of total merchandise purchased in any of the past five years 

our supply chain systems continue to provide us with valuable sales information to assist our buyers and improve merchandise allocation to our stores controlling our inventory levels has resulted in more efficient distribution and store operations 

information systems we believe that investments in technology help us to increase sales and control costs our inventory management system has allowed us to improve the efficiency of our supply chain improve merchandise flow increase inventory turnover and control distribution and store operating costs our automatic replenishment system automatically reorders key items based on actual store level sales and inventory at the end of 2010 we had approximately 2700 basic everyday items on automatic replenishment 

  

  

pointofsale data allows us to track sales and inventory by merchandise category at the store level and assists us in planning for future purchases of inventory we believe that this information allows us to ship the appropriate product to stores at the quantities commensurate with selling patterns using this pointofsale data to plan purchases of inventory has helped us increase our inventory turns in each of the last five years our inventory turns increased to approximately 42 in 2010 

corporate culture and values we believe that honesty and integrity doing the right things for the right reasons and treating people fairly and with respect are core values within our corporate culture we believe that running a business and certainly a public company carries with it a responsibility to be above reproach when making operational and financial decisions our executive management team visits and shops our stores like every customer and ideas and individual creativity on the part of our associates are encouraged particularly from our store managers who know their stores and their customers we have standards for store displays merchandise presentation and store operations we maintain an open door policy for all associates our distribution centers are operated based on objective measures of performance and virtually everyone in our store support center is available to assist associates in the stores and distribution centers 

our disclosure committee meets at least quarterly and monitors our internal controls over financial reporting to ensure that our public filings contain discussions about the risks our business faces we believe that we have the controls in place to be able to certify our financial statements additionally we have complied with the listing requirements for the nasdaq stock market 

growth strategy 

store openings and square footage growth the primary factors contributing to our net sales growth have been new store openings an active store expansion and remodel program and selective mergers and acquisitions in the last five years net sales increased at a compound annual growth rate of 103 we expect that the majority of our future sales growth will come primarily from new store openings and from our store expansion and relocation program 

the following table shows the average selling square footage of our stores and the selling square footage per new store opened over the last five years our growth and productivity statistics are reported based on selling square footage because our management believes the use of selling square footage yields a more accurate measure of store productivity 

  

 

we expect to increase our selling square footage in the future by opening new stores in underserved markets and strategically increasing our presence in our existing markets via new store openings and store expansions expansions include store relocations in fiscal 2011 and beyond we plan to predominantly open stores that are approximately 8000  10000 selling square feet and we believe this size allows us to achieve our objectives in the markets in which we plan to expand at january 29 2011 2160 of our stores totaling 648 of our selling square footage were 8000 selling square feet or larger  

in addition to new store openings we plan to continue our store expansion program to increase our net sales per store and take advantage of market opportunities we target stores for expansion based on the current sales per selling square foot and changes in market opportunities stores targeted for expansion are generally less than 6000 selling square feet in size store expansions generally increase the existing store size by approximately 3900 selling square feet 

since 1995 we have added a total of 695 stores through several mergers and acquisitions our acquisition strategy has been to target companies that have a similar singleprice point concept that have shown success in operations or companies that provide a strategic advantage we evaluate potential acquisition opportunities in our retail sector as they become available 

  

  

in november 2010 we completed our acquisition of 86 dollar giant stores based in vancouver british columbia these stores offer a wide assortment of quality general merchandise contemporary seasonal goods and everyday consumables all priced at 125 cad or less the stores operate in the canadian provinces of british columbia ontario alberta and saskatchewan this is the first expansion of our retail operations outside of the united states and provides us with a proven management team and distribution network as well as additional potential store growth in a new market 

in 2006 we completed our acquisition of 138 deal stores which included stores that offered an expanded assortment of merchandise including items that sell for more than 1 these stores provide us an opportunity to leverage our dollar tree infrastructure in the testing of new merchandise concepts including higher price points without disrupting the singleprice point model in our dollar tree stores since the acquisition we have opened new deal stores including some in new markets and operate 164 deal stores as of january 29 2011 

from time to time we also acquire the rights to store leases through bankruptcy proceedings of certain retailers we will take advantage of these opportunities as they arise in the future and fit within our selling square footage size parameters 

merchandising and distribution expanding our customer base is important to our growth plans we plan to continue to stock our new stores with the everchanging merchandise that our current customers have come to appreciate consumable merchandise typically leads to more frequent return trips to our stores resulting in increased sales the presentation and display of merchandise in our stores are critical to communicating value to our customers and creating a more exciting shopping experience we believe our approach to visual merchandising results in higher store traffic higher sales volume and an environment that encourages impulse purchases 

a strong and efficient distribution network is critical to our ability to grow and to maintain a lowcost operating structure in 2009 we purchased a new distribution center in san bernardino california which began shipping merchandise in april 2010 this distribution center replaced the salt lake city distribution center which closed when its lease expired in april 2010 we believe our distribution center network is currently capable of supporting approximately 75 billion in annual sales in the united states new distribution sites like this one in san bernardino california are strategically located to reduce stem miles maintain flexibility and improve efficiency in our store service areas we also are a party to an agreement which provides distribution services in two facilities in canada 

our stores receive approximately 90 of their inventory from our distribution centers via contract carriers the remaining store inventory primarily perishable consumable items and other vendormaintained display items are delivered directly to our stores from vendors for more information on our distribution center network see item 2 “properties” beginning on page 13 of this form 10k 

competition 

the retail industry is highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future the principal methods of competition include closeout merchandise convenience and the quality of merchandise offered to the customer we operate in the discount retail merchandise business which is currently and is expected to continue to be highly competitive with respect to price store location merchandise quality assortment and presentation and customer service our competitors include singleprice dollar stores multiprice dollar stores mass merchandisers discount retailers and variety retailers in addition several mass merchandisers and grocery store chains carry dollar store or “dollar zone” concepts in their stores which increase competition we believe we differentiate ourselves from other retailers by providing high value high quality low cost merchandise in attractively designed stores that are conveniently located our sales and profits could be reduced by increases in competition especially because there are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector 

trademarks 

we are the owners of several federal service mark registrations including dollar tree the dollar tree logo the dollar tree logo with a “1” and one priceone dollar in addition we own a concurrent use registration for dollar bill and the related logo we also acquired the rights to use trade names previously owned by everythings a dollar a former competitor in the 100 price point industry several trade names were included in the purchase including the marks everythings 100 we mean everything and everythings 100 with the acquisition of deal we became the owners of the trademark “deal” with the acquisition of dollar giant we became the owners of the trademark “dollar giant” and others in canada   we have federal trademark registrations for a variety of private labels that we use to market some of our product lines 

  

  

employees 

we employed approximately 13060 fulltime and 50800 parttime associates on january 29 2011 parttime associates work an average of less than 35 hours per week the number of parttime associates fluctuates depending on seasonal needs we consider our relationship with our associates to be good and we have not experienced significant interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements 




 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk any failure to meet market expectations including our comparable store sales growth rate earnings and earnings per share or new store openings could cause the market price of our stock to decline you should carefully consider the specific risk factors listed below together with all other information included or incorporated in this report any of the following risks may materialize and additional risks not known to us or that we now deem immaterial may arise in such event our business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected 

our profitability is vulnerable to cost increases 

future increase in costs such as the cost of merchandise wage levels shipping rates freight costs fuel costs and store occupancy costs may reduce our profitability we will not raise the sales price of our merchandise to offset cost increases because we are committed to selling at the 100 price point to continue to provide value to the customer we are dependent on our ability to adjust our product assortment to operate more efficiently or effectively or to increase our comparable store net sales in order to offset inflation we can give no assurance that we will be able to operate more efficiently or increase our comparable store net sales in the future please see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations beginning on page 19 of this form 10k for further discussion of the effect of inflation and other economic factors on our operations 

litigation may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of 

operations 

our business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees consumers suppliers competitors shareholders government agencies or others through private actions class actions administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation we are currently defendants in several employmentrelated class action cases and changes in federal law could cause these types of claims to rise even more the outcome of litigation particularly class action lawsuits regulatory actions and intellectual property claims is difficult to assess or quantify plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to these lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time in addition certain of these lawsuits if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in liability material to our financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operation are required the cost to defend current and future litigation may be significant there also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation including litigation related to product safety and customer information which could negatively affect customer perception of our business regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable 

for a discussion of current legal matters please see item 3 “legal proceedings” beginning on page 14 of this form 10k resolution of certain matters described in that item if decided against the company could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations accrued liabilities or cash flows 

changes in federal state or local law or our failure to comply with such laws could increase our expenses and expose us to legal risks 

our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations significant legislative changes such as the healthcare legislation that impact our relationship with our workforce could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations changes in other regulatory areas such as consumer credit privacy and information security product safety or environmental protection among others could cause our expenses to increase in addition if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations particularly wage and hour laws we could be subject to legal risk including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation which could adversely affect our results of operations changes in tax laws the interpretation of existing laws or our failure to sustain our reporting positions on examination could adversely affect our effective tax rate 

  

  

we could encounter disruptions or additional costs in obtaining and distributing merchandise 

our success depends on the ability of our vendors to supply merchandise and our ability to transport merchandise to our distribution centers and then ship it to our stores in a timely and costeffective manner we may not anticipate respond to or control all of the challenges of operating our receiving and distribution systems additionally if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments we could experience merchandise shortages that could lead to lost sales some of the factors that could have an adverse effect on our supply chain systems or costs are 

 

we may be unable to expand our square footage as profitably as planned 

we plan to expand our selling square footage by approximately 69 in 2011 to increase our sales and profits expanding our square footage profitably depends on a number of uncertainties including our ability to locate lease build out and open or expand stores in suitable locations on a timely basis under favorable economic terms in addition our expansion is dependent upon thirdparty developers’ abilities to acquire land obtain financing and secure necessary permits and approvals turmoil in the financial markets has made it difficult for third party developers to obtain financing for new projects we must also open or expand stores within our established geographic markets where new or expanded stores may draw sales away from our existing stores we may not manage our expansion effectively and our failure to achieve our expansion plans could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

sales below our expectations during peak seasons may cause our operating results to suffer materially 

our highest sales periods are the christmas and easter seasons we generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and our operating and net income during the fourth quarter in anticipation we stock extra inventory and hire many temporary employees to prepare our stores a reduction in sales during these periods could adversely affect our operating results particularly operating and net income to a greater extent than if a reduction occurred at other times of the year untimely merchandise delays due to receiving or distribution problems could have a similar effect sales during the easter selling season are materially affected by the timing of the easter holiday easter in fiscal 2011 is on april 24 th  while in fiscal 2010 it was on april 4 th  

  

  

our sales and profits rely on imported merchandise which may increase in cost or become unavailable 

 

merchandise imported directly accounts for approximately 40 to 45 of our total retail value purchases in addition we believe that a portion of our goods purchased from domestic vendors is imported china is the source of a substantial majority of our imports imported goods are generally less expensive than domestic goods and increase our profit margins a disruption in the flow of our imported merchandise or an increase in the cost of those goods may significantly decrease our profits risks associated with our reliance on imported goods include 

 

a downturn in economic conditions could impact our sales 

deterioration in economic conditions such as those caused by a recession inflation higher unemployment consumer debt levels lack of available credit cost increases as well as adverse weather conditions or terrorism could reduce consumer spending or cause customers to shift their spending to products we either do not sell or do not sell as profitably adverse economic conditions could disrupt consumer spending and significantly reduce our sales decrease our inventory turnover cause greater markdowns or reduce our profitability due to lower margins 

our profitability is affected by the mix of products we sell 

our gross profit margin could decrease if we increase the proportion of higher cost goods we sell in the future in recent years the percentage of our sales from higher cost consumable products has increased and is likely to increase slightly in 2011 as a result our gross profit could decrease unless we are able to maintain our current merchandise cost sufficiently to offset any decrease in our product margin percentage we can give no assurance that we will be able to do so 

pressure from competitors may reduce our sales and profits 

the retail industry is highly competitive the marketplace is highly fragmented as many different retailers compete for market share by utilizing a variety of store formats and merchandising strategies we expect competition to increase in the future because there are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector many of our current or potential competitors have greater financial resources than we do we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors please see item 1 “business” beginning on page 6 of this form 10k for further discussion of the effect of competition on our operations 

certain provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws could delay or discourage a takeover attempt that may be in a shareholders best interest 

 

our articles of incorporation and bylaws currently contain provisions that may delay or discourage a takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider in his best interest these provisions among other things 

 

  

  

however we believe that these provisions allow our board of directors to negotiate a higher price in the event of a takeover attempt which would be in the best interest of our shareholders 

in 2010 the shareholders approved an amendment to our articles of incorporation which will result in the declassification of our board of directors by 2012

stores 

as of january 29 2011 we operated 4101 stores in 48 states and the district of columbia as well as the canadian provinces of british columbia ontario alberta and saskatchewan as detailed below 

 

 

we currently lease our stores and expect to lease the majority of our new stores as we expand our leases typically provide for a short initial lease term generally five years with options to extend however in some cases we have initial lease terms of seven to ten years we believe this leasing strategy enhances our flexibility to pursue various expansion opportunities resulting from changing market conditions as current leases expire we believe that we will be able to obtain lease renewals if desired for present store locations or to obtain leases for equivalent or better locations in the same general area 

  

  

distribution centers 

the following table includes information about the distribution centers that we own and operate in the united states in 2009 we purchased a new distribution center in san bernardino california which began shipping merchandise in april 2010 this facility replaced the salt lake city distribution center which closed when its lease expired in april 2010 we believe our distribution center network is currently capable of supporting approximately 75 billion in annual sales in the united states 

 

each of our distribution centers contains advanced materials handling technologies including radiofrequency inventory tracking equipment and specialized information systems with the exception of our ridgefield facility each of our distribution centers also contains automated conveyor and sorting systems 

we are also a party to a contract which provides distribution services in british columbia and ontario in fiscal 2011 this contract terminated and we entered into a new agreement for similar services 

for more information on financing of our distribution centers see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations funding requirements beginning on page 24 of this form 10k 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

from time to time we are defendants in ordinary routine litigation or proceedings incidental to our business including allegations regarding 

 

 

in 2006 a former store manager filed a collective action against us in alabama federal court she claims that she and other store managers should have been classified as nonexempt employees under the fair labor standards act and received overtime compensation the court preliminarily allowed nationwide except california notice to be sent to all store managers employed for the three years immediately preceding the filing of the suit approximately 265 individuals are included in the collective action the court on its own motion continued the case from its previously scheduled july 2010 trial date our motion to decertify the collective action has been dismissed without prejudice to refile at a later date additional discovery pursuant to the court’s direction is presently ongoing there is no scheduled trial date we will continue to vigorously defend ourselves in this matter 

 

in 2007 two store managers filed a class action against us in california federal court claiming they and other california store managers should have been classified as nonexempt employees under california and federal law the court has allowed notice to be sent to all california store managers employed since december 12 2004 and a class of approximately 184 individuals remains we filed a motion to decertify the class which was both granted and denied in part the current class was redefined by the court in its ruling which resulted in a significant reduction in the number of class members the court on its own continued a previously scheduled march 2011 trial date a pretrial conference has been set for june 2011 at which time a new trial date will be established it is anticipated the case will go to trial in calendar year 2011 we are vigorously defending ourselves in this matter 

 

  

  

in 2008 we were sued under the equal pay act in alabama federal court by two female store managers alleging that they and other female store managers were paid less than male store managers among other things they seek monetary damages and back pay the court ordered that notice be sent to potential plaintiffs and there are now approximately 363 optin plaintiffs we expect that the court will rule upon our motion to decertify the collective action later in 2011 we are vigorously defending ourselves in this matter in 2009 34 plaintiffs most of whom are optin plaintiffs in the alabama action filed a new class action in a federal court in virginia alleging gender pay and promotion discrimination under title vii on march 11 2010 the case was dismissed with prejudice plaintiff then filed a motion requesting the court to alter amend and vacate its dismissal order which the trial court denied plaintiffs have filed an appeal to the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit it is anticipated the court will hand down a decision in 2011 

 

in 2010 two former assistant store managers filed a collective action against us in a florida federal court their amended claim is that they were required to work off the clock without compensation in violation of the fair labor standards act an additional 22 party plaintiffs have joined the suit our motion to transfer venue to the us district court for the eastern district of virginia was recently overruled without prejudice pending future case developments there is no trial date we will continue to vigorously defend ourselves in this matter 

 

we do not believe that any of these matters will individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition we cannot give assurance however that one or more of these lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the period in which they are resolved

key events and recent developments 

several key events have had or are expected to have a significant effect on our operations you should keep in mind that 

 

  

  

overview 

our net sales are derived from the sale of merchandise two major factors tend to affect our net sales trends first is our success at opening new stores or adding new stores through acquisitions second sales vary at our existing stores from one year to the next we refer to this change as a change in comparable store net sales because we compare only those stores that are open throughout both of the periods being compared we include sales from stores expanded during the year in the calculation of comparable store net sales which has the effect of increasing our comparable store net sales the term expanded also includes stores that are relocated 

at january 29 2011 we operated 4101 stores in 48 states and the district of columbia as well as the canadian provinces of british columbia ontario alberta and saskatchewan with 351 million selling square feet compared to 3806 stores with 323 million selling square feet at january 30 2010 during fiscal 2010 we opened 235 stores expanded 95 stores acquired 86 stores and closed 26 stores compared to 240 new stores opened 75 stores expanded and 25 stores closed during fiscal 2009 in the current year we increased our selling square footage by 88 of the 28 million selling square foot increase in 2010 04 million was added by expanding existing stores and 07 million was added with the acquisition of dollar giant the average size of our stores opened in 2010 was approximately 8400 selling square feet or about 10200 gross square feet for 2011 we continue to plan to open stores that are approximately 8000  10000 selling square feet or about 10000  12000 gross square feet we believe that this store size is our optimal size operationally and that this size also gives our customers an ideal shopping environment that invites them to shop longer and buy more 

in fiscal 2010 comparable store net sales increased by 63 the comparable store net sales increase was primarily the result of a 50 increase in the number of transactions and a 13 increase in average ticket we believe comparable store net sales continued to be positively affected by a number of our initiatives as debit and credit card penetration continued to increase in 2010 and we continued the rollout of frozen and refrigerated merchandise to more of our stores at january 29 2011 we had frozen and refrigerated merchandise in approximately 1840 stores compared to approximately 1400 stores at january 30 2010 we believe that the addition of frozen and refrigerated product enables us to increase sales and earnings by increasing the number of shopping trips made by our customers in addition we accept food stamps under the supplemental nutrition assistance program “snap” in approximately 3500 qualified stores compared to 2900 at the end of 2009 

with the pressures of the current economic environment we have seen increases in the demand for basic consumable products in 2010 as a result we have continued to shift the mix of inventory carried in our stores to more consumer product merchandise which we believe increases the traffic in our stores and has helped to increase our sales even during the current economic downturn while this shift in mix has impacted our merchandise costs we were able to offset that impact in the current year with decreased costs for merchandise in many of our categories 

our pointofsale technology provides us with valuable sales and inventory information to assist our buyers and improve our merchandise allocation to our stores we believe that this has enabled us to better manage our inventory flow resulting in more efficient distribution and store operations and increased inventory turnover for each of the last five years inventory turnover improved by approximately 10 basis points in 2010 

 

in 2007 legislation was enacted that increased the federal minimum wage the last increase to 725 an hour was effective in july 2009 as a result our wages have increased in the third quarter of 2009 through the first half of 2010 however we offset the increase in payroll costs through increased productivity and continued efficiencies in product flow to our stores 

we must continue to control our merchandise costs inventory levels and our general and administrative expenses as increases in these line items could negatively impact our operating results 

  

  

results of operations 

the following table expresses items from our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales on january 31 2010 the first day of fiscal 2010 we began using approximately 30 inventory pools in our retail inventory calculation rather than one inventory pool as we had done since our inception as a result of this change we recorded a nonrecurring noncash charge to gross profit and a corresponding reduction in inventory at cost of 263 million in the first quarter of 2010 

 

fiscal year ended january 29 2011 compared to fiscal year ended january 30 2010 

net sales  net sales increased 124 or 6512 million in 2010 compared to 2009 resulting from a 63 increase in comparable store net sales and sales in our new stores comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores which we include in the calculation and to a lesser extent are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing ones 

the following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store count for fiscal years ended january 29 2011 and january 30 2010 

 

of the 29 million selling square foot increase in 2010 approximately 04 million was added by expanding existing stores and 07 million was the result of the acquisition of the dollar giant stores 

gross profit margin was 355 in 2010 and 2009 excluding the effect of the 263 million noncash beginning inventory adjustment gross profit margin increased to 359 this increase was due to the following 

 

 

 

 

  

  

selling general and administrative expenses  selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 248 for 2010 compared to 257 for 2009 the decrease is primarily due to the following 

 

 

 

operating income  operating income margin was 107 in 2010 compared to 98 in 2009 excluding the 263 million noncash adjustment to beginning inventory operating income margin was 111 due to the reasons discussed above 

income taxes  our effective tax rate was 369 in 2010 and 2009 

fiscal year ended january 30 2010 compared to fiscal year ended january 31 2009 

net sales  net sales increased 126 or 5863 million in 2009 compared to 2008 resulting from a 72 increase in comparable store net sales and sales in our new stores comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores which we include in the calculation and to a lesser extent are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing ones 

the following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store count for fiscal years ended january 30 2010 and january 31 2009 

 

of the 20 million selling square foot increase in 2009 approximately 03 million was added by expanding existing stores 

gross profit margin increased to 355 in 2009 compared to 343 in 2008 the increase was due to the following 

 

 

 

selling general and administrative expenses  selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 257 for 2009 compared to 264 for 2008 the decrease is primarily due to the following 

 

 

 

operating income  due to the reasons discussed above operating income margin was 98 in 2009 compared to 79 in 2008 

income taxes  our effective tax rate was 369 in 2009 compared to 361 in 2008 the higher rate in the current year was the result of the favorable settlement of several state tax audits in 2008 and a higher blended state tax rate in 2009 

  

  

liquidity and capital resources 

our business requires capital to build and open new stores expand our distribution network and operate existing stores our working capital requirements for existing stores are seasonal and usually reach their peak in september and october historically we have satisfied our seasonal working capital requirements for existing stores and have funded our store opening and distribution network expansion programs from internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities 

the following table compares cashflow related information for the years ended january 29 2011 january 30 2010 and january 31 2009 

 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased 623 million in 2010 compared to 2009 due to an increase in cash used to purchase merchandise inventories partially offset by increased earnings before income taxes depreciation and amortization in the current year 

net cash provided by operating activities increased 1779 million in 2009 compared to 2008 due to increased earnings before income taxes depreciation and amortization in 2009 also providing more cash at january 30 2010 was better inventory management resulting in lower inventory balances per store and higher accounts payable balances due to the timing of payments and increased incentive compensation accruals 

net cash used in investing activities increased 1616 million in the current year primarily due to shortterm investment activity and the dollar giant acquisition in 2010 we purchased 1578 million of shortterm investments compared to 278 million in 2009 this was partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the sales of shortterm investments of 108 million in the current year 

net cash used in investing activities increased 1105 million in 2009 primarily due to shortterm investment activity and increased capital expenditures in 2009 in 2008 we liquidated our shortterm investments due to market conditions the net proceeds from this liquidation of 405 million were put into cash equivalent money market accounts in 2009 we also purchased 278 million of shortterm investments capital expenditures increased 335 million in 2009 primarily due to the purchase of our new distribution center in san bernardino ca 

in 2010 net cash used in financing activities increased 2430 million as a result of increased share repurchases in 2010 and repayments of 138 million for debt acquired from dollar giant 

in 2009 net cash used in financing activities increased 1840 million as the result of share repurchases in 2009 there were no share repurchases in 2008 

at january 29 2011 our longterm borrowings were 2665 million and our capital lease commitments were 14 million we also have 1215 million and 500 million letter of credit reimbursement and security agreements under which approximately 1069 million were committed to letters of credit issued for routine purchases of imported merchandise at january 29 2011 

on february 20 2008 we entered into a fiveyear 5500 million unsecured credit agreement the agreement the agreement provides for a 3000 million revolving line of credit including up to 1500 million in available letters of credit and a 2500 million term loan the interest rate on the agreement is based at our option on a libor rate plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin the revolving line of credit also bears a facilities fee calculated as a percentage as defined of the amount available under the line of credit payable quarterly the term loan is due and payable in full at the five year maturity date of the agreement the agreement also bears an administrative fee payable annually the agreement among other things requires the maintenance of certain specified financial ratios restricts the payment of certain distributions and prohibits the incurrence of certain new indebtedness as of january 29 2011 the 2500 million term loan is outstanding under the agreement and there were no amounts outstanding under the 3000 million revolving line of credit 

  

  

we repurchased approximately 93 million shares for approximately 4147 million in fiscal 2010 we repurchased approximately 43 million shares for approximately 1931 million in fiscal 2009 less than 01 million of these shares totaling 24 million had not settled as of january 30 2010 and these amounts were accrued in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of january 30 2010 we had no share repurchases in fiscal 2008 at january 29 2011 we have approximately 3459 million remaining under board authorization 

funding requirements 

overview 

we expect our cash needs for opening new stores and expanding existing stores in fiscal 2011 to total approximately 1444   million which includes capital expenditures initial inventory and preopening costs our estimated capital expenditures for fiscal 2011 are between 2150 and 2250 million including planned expenditures for our new and expanded stores and the addition of freezers and coolers to approximately 225 stores we believe that we can adequately fund our working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures for the next few years from net cash provided by operations and potential borrowings under our existing credit facility 

the following tables summarize our material contractual obligations at january 29 2011 including both on and offbalance sheet arrangements and our commitments including interest on longterm borrowings in millions 

 

 

 

  

  

lease financing 

operating lease obligations our operating lease obligations are primarily for payments under noncancelable store leases the commitment includes amounts for leases that were signed prior to january 29 2011 for stores that were not yet open on january 29 2011 

longterm borrowings 

credit agreement  on february 20 2008 we entered into a fiveyear 5500 million unsecured credit agreement the agreement the agreement provides for a 3000 million revolving line of credit including up to 1500 million in available letters of credit and a 2500 million term loan the interest rate on the facility will be based at our option on a libor rate plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin the interest rate on the facility was 076 at january 29 2011 the revolving line of credit also bears a facilities fee calculated as a percentage as defined of the amount available under the line of credit payable quarterly the term loan is due and payable in full at the five year maturity date of the agreement the agreement also bears an administrative fee payable annually the agreement among other things requires the maintenance of certain specified financial ratios restricts the payment of certain distributions and prohibits the incurrence of certain new indebtedness as of january 29 2011 we had the 2500 million term loan outstanding under the agreement and no amounts outstanding under the 3000 million revolving line of credit 

revenue bond financing  in may 1998 we entered into an agreement with the mississippi business finance corporation under which it issued 190 million of variablerate demand revenue bonds we used the proceeds from the bonds to finance the acquisition construction and installation of land buildings machinery and equipment for our distribution facility in olive branch mississippi at january 29 2011 the balance outstanding on the bonds was 165 million these bonds are due to be fully repaid in june 2018 the bonds do not have a prepayment penalty as long as the interest rate remains variable the bonds contain a demand provision and therefore outstanding amounts are classified as current liabilities we pay interest monthly based on a variable interest rate which was 030 at january 29 2011 

interest on longterm borrowings this amount represents interest payments on the credit agreement and the revenue bond financing using the interest rates for each at january 29 2011 

commitments 

letters of credit and surety bonds  we are a party to two letter of credit reimbursement and security agreements one which provides 1215 million for letters of credit and one which provides 500 million for letters of credit letters of credit are generally issued for the routine purchase of imported merchandise and we had approximately 1069 million of purchases committed under these letters of credit at january 29 2011 

we also have approximately 131 million of letters of credit and 25 million of surety bonds outstanding for our selfinsurance programs and certain utility payment obligations at some of our stores 

freight contracts we have contracted outbound freight services from various carriers with contracts expiring through fiscal 2014 the total amount of these commitments is approximately 2888 million 

technology assets we have commitments totaling approximately 59 million to primarily purchase store technology assets for our stores during 2011 

derivative financial instruments 

on march 20 2008 we entered into two 750 million interest rate swap agreements these interest rate swaps are used to manage the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations on a portion of our 2500 million variable rate term loan under these agreements we pay interest to financial institutions at a fixed rate of 28 in exchange the financial institutions pay us at a variable rate which approximates the variable rate on the debt excluding the credit spread these swaps qualify for hedge accounting treatment and expire in march 2011 

in 2010 we entered into fuel derivative contracts with third parties which included approximately 06 million gallons of diesel fuel or approximately 20 of our fuel needs from february 2011 through april 2011 these derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and therefore all changes in fair value for these derivatives are included in earnings in march 2011 we entered into fuel derivative contracts for approximately 28 million gallons of diesel fuel or approximately 50 of our fuel needs from august 2011 through january 2012 

  

  

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates certain of our estimates require a high level of judgment and have the potential to have a material effect on the financial statements if actual results vary significantly   from those estimates following is a discussion of the estimates that we consider critical 

inventory valuation 

as discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weightedaverage basis cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weightedaverage basis under the retail inventory method the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated costtoretail ratio to the retail value of inventories from our inception and through fiscal 2009 we used one inventory pool for this calculation because of our investments over the years in our retail technology systems we were able to refine our estimate of inventory cost under the retail method and on january 31 2010 the first day of fiscal 2010 we began using approximately 30 inventory pools in our retail inventory calculation as a result of this change we recorded a nonrecurring noncash charge to gross profit and a corresponding reduction in inventory at cost of approximately 263 million in the first quarter of 2010 the retail inventory method is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis 

inventory valuation methods require certain significant management estimates and judgments including estimates of future merchandise markdowns and shrink which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins the averaging required in applying the retail inventory method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns could under certain circumstances result in costs not being recorded in the proper period 

we estimate our markdown reserve based on the consideration of a variety of factors including but not limited to quantities of slow moving or seasonal carryover merchandise on hand historical markdown statistics and future merchandising plans the accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors some of which are outside of our control including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends historically we have not experienced significant differences in our estimated reserve for markdowns compared with actual results 

our accrual for shrink is based on the actual historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories adjusted if necessary for current economic conditions and business trends these estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger our physical inventory counts are generally taken between january and september of each year therefore the shrink accrual recorded at january 29 2011 is based on estimated shrink for most of 2010 including the fourth quarter we have not experienced significant fluctuations in historical shrink rates beyond approximately 1020 basis points in our dollar tree stores for the last few years however we have sometimes experienced higher than typical shrink in acquired stores in the year following an acquisition we periodically adjust our shrink estimates to address these factors as they become apparent 

our management believes that our application of the retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market each year on a consistent basis 

accrued expenses 

on a monthly basis we estimate certain expenses in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred our most material estimates include domestic freight expenses selfinsurance costs storelevel operating expenses such as property taxes and utilities and certain other expenses such as legal reserves our freight and storelevel operating expenses are estimated based on current activity and historical trends and results our workers compensation and general liability insurance accruals are recorded based on actuarial valuations which are adjusted at least annually based on a review performed by a thirdparty actuary these actuarial valuations are estimates based on our historical loss development factors certain other expenses are estimated and recorded in the periods that management becomes aware of them the related accruals are adjusted as management’s estimates change differences in managements estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual materially different from the calculated accrual our experience has been that some of our estimates are too high and others are too low historically the net total of these differences has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations our legal proceedings are described in item 3 “legal proceedings” beginning on page 14 of this form 10k the outcome of litigation particularly class or collective action lawsuits is difficult to assess quantify or predict 

  

  

income taxes 

on a quarterly basis we estimate our required income tax liability and assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets our income taxes payable are estimated based on enacted tax rates including estimated tax rates in states where our store base is growing applied to the income expected to be taxed currently management assesses the recoverability of deferred tax assets based on the availability of carrybacks of future deductible amounts and management’s projections for future taxable income we cannot guarantee that we will generate taxable income in future years historically we have not experienced significant differences in our estimates of our tax accrual 

in addition we have a recorded liability for our estimate of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns judgment is required in evaluating the application of federal and state tax laws including relevant case law and assessing whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination and if so judgment is also required as to the measurement of the amount of tax benefit that will be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or the final outcome differs from the amounts recorded we believe that our liability for uncertain tax positions is adequate for further discussion of our changes in reserves during 2010 see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data  note 3 to the consolidated financial statements” beginning on page 40 of this form 10k 

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations 

we experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales comparable store net sales operating income and net income and expect this trend to continue our results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors including 

 

our highest sales periods are the christmas and easter seasons easter was observed on april 12 2009 april 4 2010 and will be observed on april 24 2011 we believe that the later easter in 2011 could result in a 150 million increase in sales in the first quarter of 2011 as compared to the first quarter of 2010 we generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and of our operating and net income during the fourth quarter in anticipation of increased sales activity during these months we purchase substantial amounts of inventory and hire a significant number of temporary employees to supplement our continuing store staff our operating results particularly operating and net income could suffer if our net sales were below seasonal norms during the fourth quarter or during the easter season for any reason including merchandise delivery delays due to receiving or distribution problems consumer sentiment or inclement weather 

our unaudited results of operations for the eight most recent quarters are shown in a table in footnote 11 of the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

inflation and other economic factors 

our ability to provide quality merchandise at a fixed price and on a profitable basis may be subject to economic factors and influences that we cannot control consumer spending could decline because of economic pressures including unemployment and rising fuel prices reductions in consumer confidence and spending could have an adverse effect on our sales national or international events including war or terrorism could lead to disruptions in economies in the united states or in foreign countries where we purchase some of our merchandise these and other factors could increase our merchandise costs and other costs that are critical to our operations such as shipping and wage rates 

  

  

shipping costs  currently transpacific shipping rates are negotiated with individual freight lines and are subject to fluctuation based on supply and demand for containers and current fuel costs  we can give no assurances as to the final actual rates for 2011 as we are in the early stages of our negotiations 

minimum wage in 2007 legislation was enacted that increased the federal minimum wage from 515 an hour to 725 an hour over a two year period with the final increase being enacted in july 2009 as a result our wages increased in 2009 and through the first half of 2010 however we partially offset the increase in payroll costs through increased productivity and continued efficiencies in product flow to our stores 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of our business including the impact of interest rate changes and diesel fuel cost changes we may enter into interest rate or diesel fuel swaps to manage exposure to interest rate and diesel fuel price changes we do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging and we do not hold derivative instruments for trading purposes 

interest rate risk 

we use variablerate debt to finance certain of our operations and capital improvements these obligations expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates if interest rates increase interest expense increases conversely if interest rates decrease interest expense also decreases we believe it is beneficial to limit the variability of our interest payments 

to meet this objective we entered into derivative instruments in the form of interest rate swaps to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in the variableinterest rates on a portion of our 2500 million term loan the interest rate swaps reduce the interest rate exposure on these variablerate obligations under the interest rate swaps we pay the bank at a fixedrate and receive variableinterest at a rate approximating the variablerate on the obligation thereby creating the economic equivalent of a fixedrate obligation we entered into two 750 million interest rate swap agreements in march 2008 to manage the risk associated with the interest rate fluctuations on a portion of our 2500 million variable rate term loan 

the following table summarizes the financial terms of our interest rate swap agreements and the fair value of the interest rate swaps at january 29 2011 

 

hypothetically a 1 change in interest rates results in an approximate 15 million change in the amount paid or received under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement on an annual basis due to many factors management is not able to predict the changes in the fair values of our interest rate swaps these fair values are obtained from independent pricing services reflecting broker market quotes 

diesel fuel cost risk 

in order to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in diesel fuel costs we entered into fuel derivative contracts with third parties which included approximately 06 million gallons of diesel fuel or approximately 20 of the our fuel needs from february 2011 through april 2011 under these contracts we pay the third party a fixed price for diesel fuel and receive variable diesel fuel prices at amounts approximating current diesel fuel costs thereby creating the economic equivalent of a fixed rate obligation these derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and therefore all changes in fair value for these derivatives are included in earnings the fair value of these contracts at january 29 2011 was an asset of 02 million in march 2011 we entered into fuel derivative contracts for approximately 28 million gallons of diesel fuel or approximately 50 of our fuel needs from august 2011 through january 2012

 item 1 business 

overview 

we are the leading operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise at the fixed price of 100 we believe the variety and quality of products we sell for 100 sets us apart from our competitors at january 30 2010 we operated 3806 discount variety retail stores approximately 3650 of these stores sell substantially all items for 100 or less substantially all of the remaining stores operating as deal sell items for 100 or less but also sell items for more than 1 our stores operate under the names of dollar tree deal and dollar bills 

we believe our optimal store is between 8000 and 10000 selling square feet this store size reflects our expanded merchandise offerings and improved service to our customers as we have been expanding our merchandise offerings we have added freezers and coolers to approximately 1400 stores during the past five years to increase traffic and transaction size at january 28 2006 we operated 2914 stores in 48 states at january 30 2010 we operated 3806 stores in 48 states and the district of columbia our selling square footage increased from approximately 230 million square feet in january 2006 to 323 million square feet in january 2010 our store growth has resulted primarily from opening new stores with additional growth from mergers and acquisitions such as deal 

business strategy 

value merchandise offering  we strive to exceed our customers expectations of the variety and quality of products that they can purchase for 100 by offering items that we believe typically sell for higher prices elsewhere we buy approximately 55 to 60 of our merchandise domestically and import the remaining 40 to 45 our domestic purchases include closeouts and promotional merchandise we believe our mix of imported and domestic merchandise affords our buyers flexibility that allows them to consistently exceed the customers expectations in addition direct relationships with manufacturers permit us to select from a broad range of products and customize packaging product sizes and package quantities that meet our customers needs 

mix of basic variety and seasonal merchandise we maintain a balanced selection of products within traditional variety store categories we offer a wide selection of everyday basic products and we supplement these basic everyday items with seasonal closeout and promotional merchandise we attempt to keep certain basic consumable merchandise in our stores continuously to establish our stores as a destination and we have slightly increased the mix of consumable merchandise in order to increase the traffic in our stores closeout and promotional merchandise is purchased opportunistically and represents less than 10 of our purchases 

our merchandise mix consists of 

 

we have added freezers and coolers to certain stores and increased the amount of consumable merchandise carried by those stores we believe this initiative helps drive additional transactions and allows us to appeal to a broader demographic mix we have added freezers and coolers to approximately 200 more stores in 2009 therefore as of january 30 2010 we have freezers and coolers in approximately 1400 of our stores we plan to add them to approximately 225 more stores in 2010 as a result of the installation of freezers and coolers in select stores consumable merchandise has grown as a percentage of purchases and sales and we expect this trend to continue the following table shows the percentage of purchases of each major product group for the years ended january 30 2010 and january 31 2009 

 

at any point in time we carry approximately 6000 items in our stores and as of the end of 2009 approximately 2200 of our basic everyday items are automatically replenished the remaining items are primarily ordered by our store managers on a weekly basis through automatic replenishment and our store managers’ ability to order product each store manager is able to satisfy the demands of their particular customer base 

customer payment methods all of our stores accept cash checks debit cards visa credit cards and discover and approximately 1100 stores accept mastercard credit cards  we began accepting visa credit cards at all of our stores in the fourth quarter of 2007 along with the shift to more consumables and the rollout of freezers and coolers we have increased the number of stores accepting electronic benefits transferebt cards and food stamps under the supplemental nutrition assistance program “snap” to approximately 2900 stores as of january 30 2010 

convenient locations and store size we primarily focus on opening new stores in strip shopping centers anchored by mass merchandisers whose target customers we believe to be similar to ours our stores have proven successful in metropolitan areas midsized cities and small towns the range of our store sizes allows us to target a particular location with a store that best suits that market and takes advantage of available real estate opportunities our stores are attractively designed and create an inviting atmosphere for shoppers by using bright lighting vibrant colors decorative signs and background music we enhance the store design with attractive merchandise displays we believe this design attracts new and repeat customers and enhances our image as both a destination and impulse purchase store 

for more information on retail locations and retail store leases see item 2 properties” beginning on page 13 of this form 10k 

profitable stores with strong cash flow we maintain a disciplined costsensitive approach to store site selection in order to minimize the initial capital investment required and maximize our potential to generate high operating margins and strong cash flows we believe that our stores have a relatively small shopping radius which allows us to profitably concentrate multiple stores within a single market our ability to open new stores is dependent upon among other factors locating suitable sites and negotiating favorable lease terms 

the strong cash flows generated by our stores allow us to selffund infrastructure investment and new stores over the past five years cash flows from operating activities have exceeded capital expenditures 

for more information on our results of operations see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” beginning on page 18 of this form 10k 

cost control  we believe that our substantial buying power at the 100 price point and our flexibility in making sourcing decisions contributes to our successful purchasing strategy which includes disciplined targeted merchandise margin goals by category we also believe our ability to select quality merchandise helps to minimize markdowns we buy products on an orderbyorder basis and have no material longterm purchase contracts or other assurances of continued product supply or guaranteed product cost no vendor accounted for more than 10 of total merchandise purchased in any of the past five years 

our supply chain systems continue to provide us with valuable sales information to assist our buyers and improve merchandise allocation to our stores controlling our inventory levels has resulted in more efficient distribution and store operations 

information systems we believe that investments in technology help us to increase sales and control costs our inventory management system has allowed us to improve the efficiency of our supply chain improve merchandise flow increase inventory turnover and control distribution and store operating costs our automatic replenishment system automatically reorders key items based on actual store level sales and inventory at the end of 2009 we had approximately 2200 basic everyday items on automatic replenishment 

pointofsale data allows us to track sales and inventory by merchandise category at the store level and assists us in planning for future purchases of inventory we believe that this information allows us to ship the appropriate product to stores at the quantities commensurate with selling patterns using this pointofsale data to plan purchases of inventory has helped us decrease our inventory per square foot in the current year our inventory turns also increased approximately 25 basis points in 2009 to over 4 turns for the year inventory turnover has increased in each of the last five years 

corporate culture and values we believe that honesty and integrity doing the right things for the right reasons and treating people fairly and with respect are core values within our corporate culture we believe that running a business and certainly a public company carries with it a responsibility to be above reproach when making operational and financial decisions our executive management team visits and shops our stores like every customer and ideas and individual creativity on the part of our associates are encouraged particularly from our store managers who know their stores and their customers we have standards for store displays merchandise presentation and store operations we maintain an open door policy for all associates our distribution centers are operated based on objective measures of performance and virtually everyone in our store support center is available to assist associates in the stores and distribution centers 

our disclosure committee meets at least quarterly and monitors our internal controls over financial reporting to ensure that our public filings contain discussions about the risks our business faces we believe that we have the controls in place to be able to certify our financial statements additionally we have complied with the updated listing requirements for the nasdaq stock market 

growth strategy 

store openings and square footage growth the primary factors contributing to our net sales growth have been new store openings an active store expansion and remodel program and selective mergers and acquisitions in the last five years net sales increased at a compound annual growth rate of 114 we expect that the majority of our future sales growth will come primarily from new store openings and from our store expansion and relocation program 

the following table shows the average selling square footage of our stores and the selling square footage per new store opened over the last five years our growth and productivity statistics are reported based on selling square footage because our management believes the use of selling square footage yields a more accurate measure of store productivity the selling square footage statistics for 2005 through 2009 are estimates based on the relationship of selling to gross square footage 

   

 

we expect to increase our selling square footage in the future by opening new stores in underserved markets and strategically increasing our presence in our existing markets via new store openings and store expansions expansions include store relocations in fiscal 2010 and beyond we plan to predominantly open stores that are approximately 8000  10000 selling square feet and we believe this size allows us to achieve our objectives in the markets in which we plan to expand at january 30 2010 1724 of our stores totaling 590 of our selling square footage were 8150 selling square feet or larger  

in addition to new store openings we plan to continue our store expansion program to increase our net sales per store and take advantage of market opportunities we target stores for expansion based on the current sales per selling square foot and changes in market opportunities stores targeted for expansion are generally less than 6000 selling square feet in size store expansions generally increase the existing store size by approximately 3500 selling square feet 

since 1995 we have added a total of 609 stores through four mergers and several small acquisitions our acquisition strategy has been to target companies that have a similar singleprice point concept that has shown success in operations or companies that provide a strategic advantage we evaluate potential acquisition opportunities in our retail sector as they become available 

in 2006 we completed our acquisition of 138 deal stores which included stores that offered an expanded assortment of merchandise including items that sell for more than 1 these stores provide us an opportunity to leverage our dollar tree infrastructure in the testing of new merchandise concepts including higher price points without disrupting the singleprice point model in our dollar tree stores since the acquisition we have opened new deal stores including some in new markets and operate 158 deal stores as of january 30 2010 

from time to time we also acquire the rights to store leases through bankruptcy proceedings of certain retailers we will take advantage of these opportunities as they arise in the future 

merchandising and distribution expanding our customer base is important to our growth plans we plan to continue to stock our new stores with the everchanging merchandise that our current customers have come to appreciate consumable merchandise typically leads to more frequent return trips to our stores resulting in increased sales the presentation and display of merchandise in our stores are critical to communicating value to our customers and creating a more exciting shopping experience we believe our approach to visual merchandising results in higher store traffic higher sales volume and an environment that encourages impulse purchases 

a strong and efficient distribution network is critical to our ability to grow and to maintain a lowcost operating structure in november 2009 we purchased a new distribution center in san bernardino california which will begin shipping merchandise in april 2010 this distribution center will replace the salt lake city distribution center which will close when its lease expires in april 2010 with the inclusion of our san bernardino california distribution center and the exclusion of our salt lake city distribution center we believe our distribution center network is capable of supporting approximately 75 billion in annual sales new distribution sites like this one in san bernardino california are strategically located to reduce stem miles maintain flexibility and improve efficiency in our store service areas 

our stores receive approximately 90 of their inventory from our distribution centers via contract carriers the remaining store inventory primarily perishable consumable items and other vendormaintained display items are delivered directly to our stores from vendors for more information on our distribution center network see item 2 “properties ” beginning on page 13 of this form 10k 

competition 

the retail industry is highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future the principal methods of competition include closeout merchandise convenience and the quality of merchandise offered to the customer we operate in the discount retail merchandise business which is currently and is expected to continue to be highly competitive with respect to price store location merchandise quality assortment and presentation and customer service our competitors include singleprice dollar stores multiprice dollar stores mass merchandisers discount retailers and variety retailers in addition several mass merchandisers and grocery store chains carry dollar store or “dollar zone” concepts in their stores which increases competition we believe we differentiate ourselves from other retailers by providing high value high quality low cost merchandise in attractively designed stores that are conveniently located our sales and profits could be reduced by increases in competition especially because there are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector 

trademarks 

we are the owners of several federal service mark registrations including dollar tree the dollar tree logo the dollar tree logo with a “1” and one priceone dollar we also own a concurrent use registration for dollar bill and the related logo during 1997 we acquired the rights to use trade names previously owned by everythings a dollar a former competitor in the 100 price point industry several trade names were included in the purchase including the marks everythings 100 we mean everything and everythings 100 with the acquisition of deal we became the owners of the trademark “deal” we have federal trademark registrations for a variety of private labels that we use to market some of our product lines 

employees 

we employed approximately 12480 fulltime and 42000 parttime associates on january 30 2010 parttime associates work 35 hours per week or less the number of parttime associates fluctuates depending on seasonal needs we consider our relationship with our associates to be good and we have not experienced significant interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements 




 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk any failure to meet market expectations including our comparable store sales growth rate earnings and earnings per share or new store openings could cause the market price of our stock to decline you should carefully consider the specific risk factors listed below together with all other information included or incorporated in this report any of the following risks may materialize and additional risks not known to us or that we now deem immaterial may arise in such event our business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected 

our profitability is vulnerable to cost increases 

future increase in costs such as the cost of merchandise wage levels shipping rates freight costs fuel costs and store occupancy costs may reduce our profitability as a fixed price retailer we cannot raise the sale price of our merchandise to offset cost increases we are dependent on our ability to operate more efficiently or effectively or increase our comparable store net sales in order to offset inflation we can give no assurance that we will be able to operate more efficiently or increase our comparable store net sales in the future please see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations beginning on page 18 of this form 10k for further discussion of the effect of inflation and other economic factors on our operations 

litigation may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees consumers suppliers competitors shareholders government agencies or others through private actions class actions administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation the number of employment related class actions filed each year has continued to increase and recent changes in federal law may cause claims to rise even more the outcome of litigation particularly class action lawsuits regulatory actions and intellectual property claims is difficult to assess or quantify plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to these lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time in addition certain of these lawsuits if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in liability material to our financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operation are required the cost to defend future litigation may be significant there also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could negatively affect customer perception of our business regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable 

for a discussion of current legal matters please see item 3 “legal proceedings” beginning on page 14 of this form 10k resolution of certain matters described in that item if decided against the company could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations accrued liabilities or cash flows 

changes in federal state or local law or our failure to comply with such laws could increase our expenses and expose us to legal risks 

our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations significant legislative changes such as the proposed employee free choice act and the proposed healthcare legislation that impact our relationship with our workforce could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations changes in other regulatory areas such as consumer credit privacy and information security product safety or environmental protection among others could cause our expenses to increase in addition if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations particularly wage and hour laws we could be subject to legal risk including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation which could adversely affect our results of operations changes in tax laws the interpretation of existing laws or our failure to sustain our reporting positions on examination could adversely affect our effective tax rate 

we could encounter disruptions or additional costs in obtaining and distributing merchandise 

our success depends on the ability of our vendors to supply merchandise and our ability to transport merchandise to our distribution centers and then ship it to our stores in a timely and costeffective manner we may not anticipate respond to or control all of the challenges of operating our receiving and distribution systems additionally if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments we could experience merchandise shortages that could lead to lost sales some of the factors that could have an adverse effect on our supply chain systems or costs are 

 

we may be unable to expand our square footage as profitably as planned 

we plan to expand our selling square footage by approximately 63 in 2010 to increase our sales and profits expanding our square footage profitably depends on a number of uncertainties including our ability to locate lease build out and open or expand stores in suitable locations on a timely basis under favorable economic terms in addition our expansion is dependent upon thirdparty developers’ abilities to acquire land obtain financing and secure necessary permits and approvals turmoil in the financial markets has made it difficult for third party developers to obtain financing for new projects we must also open or expand stores within our established geographic markets where new or expanded stores may draw sales away from our existing stores we may not manage our expansion effectively and our failure to achieve our expansion plans could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

sales below our expectations during peak seasons may cause our operating results to suffer materially 

our highest sales periods are the christmas and easter seasons we generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and our operating and net income during the fourth quarter in anticipation we stock extra inventory and hire many temporary employees to prepare our stores a reduction in sales during these periods could adversely affect our operating results particularly operating and net income to a greater extent than if a reduction occurred at other times of the year untimely merchandise delays due to receiving or distribution problems could have a similar effect sales during the easter selling season are materially affected by the timing of the easter holiday easter in fiscal 2010 is on april 4 th  while in fiscal 2009 it was on april 12 th  we believe that the earlier easter in 2010 could potentially result in 100 million of decreased sales in the first quarter of 2010 when compared to the first quarter of 2009 

our sales and profits rely on imported merchandise which may increase in cost or become unavailable 

merchandise imported directly accounts for approximately 40 to 45 of our total retail value purchases in addition we believe that a small portion of our goods purchased from domestic vendors is imported china is the source of a substantial majority of our imports imported goods are generally less expensive than domestic goods and increase our profit margins a disruption in the flow of our imported merchandise or an increase in the cost of those goods may significantly decrease our profits risks associated with our reliance on imported goods include 

 

a downturn in economic conditions could impact our sales 

deterioration in economic conditions such as those caused by a recession inflation higher unemployment consumer debt levels lack of available credit cost increases as well as adverse weather conditions or terrorism could reduce consumer spending or cause customers to shift their spending to products we either do not sell or do not sell as profitably adverse economic conditions could disrupt consumer spending and significantly reduce our sales decrease our inventory turnover cause greater markdowns or reduce our profitability due to lower margins 

our profitability is affected by the mix of products we sell 

our gross profit could decrease if we increase the proportion of higher cost goods we sell in the future in recent years the percentage of our sales from higher cost consumable products has increased and is likely to increase slightly in 2010 as a result our gross profit will decrease unless we are able to maintain our current merchandise cost sufficiently to offset any decrease in our product margin percentage we can give no assurance that we will be able to do so 

pressure from competitors may reduce our sales and profits 

the retail industry is highly competitive the marketplace is highly fragmented as many different retailers compete for market share by utilizing a variety of store formats and merchandising strategies we expect competition to increase in the future because there are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector many of our current or potential competitors have greater financial resources than we do we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors please see item 1 “business” beginning on page 6 of this form 10k for further discussion of the effect of competition on our operations 

the price of our common shares as traded on the nasdaq global select market may be volatile 

our stock price may fluctuate substantially as a result of factors beyond our control including but not limited to general economic and stock market conditions risks relating to our business and industry as discussed above strategic actions by us or our competitors variations in our quarterly operating performance our future sales or purchases of our common shares and investor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our common shares relative to other investment alternatives 

certain provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws could delay or discourage a takeover attempt that may be in a shareholders best interest 

 

our articles of incorporation and bylaws currently contain provisions that may delay or discourage a takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider in his best interest these provisions among other things 

 

 

  

  however we believe that these provisions allow our board of directors to negotiate a higher price in the event of a takeover attempt which would be in the best interest of our shareholders 

 

  our articles of incorporation also classify our board of directors into three classes however our board of directors will recommend at the annual meeting in 2010 that shareholders support an amendment to our articles of incorporation to declassify the board

 item 2 properties 

stores 

as of january 30 2010 we operated 3806 stores in 48 states and the district of columbia as detailed below 

 

 

we currently lease our stores and expect to continue to lease new stores as we expand our leases typically provide for a short initial lease term generally five years with options to extend however in some cases we have initial lease terms of seven to ten years we believe this leasing strategy enhances our flexibility to pursue various expansion opportunities resulting from changing market conditions as current leases expire we believe that we will be able to obtain lease renewals if desired for present store locations or to obtain leases for equivalent or better locations in the same general area 

  

  

distribution centers 

the following table includes information about the distribution centers that we currently own or operate our salt lake city distribution center will close in april 2010 at its lease expiration date in november 2009 we purchased a new distribution center in san bernardino california which will begin shipping merchandise in april 2010 with the inclusion of our san bernardino california distribution center and the exclusion of our salt lake city distribution center we believe our distribution center network is capable of supporting approximately 75 billion in annual sales 

 

each of our distribution centers contains advanced materials handling technologies including radiofrequency inventory tracking equipment and specialized information systems with the exception of our salt lake city and ridgefield facilities each of our distribution centers also contains automated conveyor and sorting systems 

for more information on financing of our distribution centers see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations funding requirements beginning on page 23 of this form 10k 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

from time to time we are defendants in ordinary routine litigation or proceedings incidental to our business including allegations regarding 

 

 

in 2006 a former store manager filed a collective action against us in alabama federal court she claims that she and other store managers should have been classified as nonexempt employees under the fair labor standards act and received overtime compensation the court preliminarily allowed nationwide except california notice to be sent to all store managers employed for the three years immediately preceding the filing of the suit approximately 500 individuals are included in the collective action the court presently has before it our motion to decertify the collective action together with the briefs of the parties if the motion is denied and the case proceeds as a collective action it is scheduled for trial in the summer of 2010 we are vigorously defending ourselves in this matter 

 

in 2007 two store managers filed a class action against us in california federal court claiming they and other california store managers should have been classified as nonexempt employees under california and federal law the court has allowed notice to be sent to all california store managers employed since december 12 2004 and a class of approximately 720 individuals exists following discovery which is ongoing we will seek to decertify the class no trial date has been scheduled we are vigorously defending ourselves in this matter 

 

in 2008 we were sued under the equal pay act in alabama federal court by two female store managers alleging that they and other female store managers were paid less than male store managers among other things they seek monetary damages and back pay the court ordered that notice be sent to potential plaintiffs and there are now approximately 340 opt in plaintiffs we expect that the court will consider our motion to decertify the collective action later in 2010 in october 2009 34 plaintiffs most of whom are optin plaintiffs in the alabama action filed a new class action in a federal court in virginia alleging gender pay and promotion discrimination under title vii subsequent to year end the case was dismissed with prejudice at this date the plaintiffs have a right of appeal to the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit 

 

we do not believe that any of these matters will individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition we cannot give assurance however that one or more of these lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the period in which they are resolved

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

in management’s discussion and analysis we explain the general financial condition and the results of operations for our company including 

 

as you read management’s discussion and analysis please refer to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10k which present the results of operations for the fiscal years ended january 30 2010 january 31 2009 and february 2 2008 in management’s discussion and analysis we analyze and explain the annual changes in some specific line items in the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year 2009 compared to the comparable fiscal year 2008 and the fiscal year 2008 compared to the comparable fiscal year 2007 

key events and recent developments 

several key events have had or are expected to have a significant effect on our operations you should keep in mind that 

 

overview 

our net sales are derived from the sale of merchandise two major factors tend to affect our net sales trends first is our success at opening new stores or adding new stores through acquisitions second sales vary at our existing stores from one year to the next we refer to this change as a change in comparable store net sales because we compare only those stores that are open throughout both of the periods being compared we include sales from stores expanded during the year in the calculation of comparable store net sales which has the effect of increasing our comparable store net sales the term expanded also includes stores that are relocated 

at january 30 2010 we operated 3806 stores in 48 states and the district of columbia with 323 million selling square feet compared to 3591 stores with 303 million selling square feet at january 31 2009 during fiscal 2009 we opened 240 stores expanded 75 stores and closed 25 stores compared to 231 new stores opened 86 stores expanded and 51 stores closed during fiscal 2008 in the current year we increased our selling square footage by 66 of the 20 million selling square foot increase in 2009 03 million was added by expanding existing stores the average size of our stores opened in 2009 was approximately 8500 selling square feet or about 10800 gross square feet for 2010 we continue to plan to open stores that are approximately 8000  10000 selling square feet or about 10000  12000 gross square feet we believe that this store size is our optimal size operationally and that this size also gives our customers an ideal shopping environment that invites them to shop longer and buy more 

in fiscal 2009 comparable store net sales increased by 72 the comparable store net sales increase was primarily the result of an increase in the number of transactions we believe comparable store net sales continued to be positively affected by a number of our initiatives as debit and credit card penetration continued to increase in 2009 and we continued the rollout of frozen and refrigerated merchandise to more of our stores at january 30 2010 we had frozen and refrigerated merchandise in approximately 1400 stores compared to approximately 1200 stores at january 31 2009 we believe that the addition of frozen and refrigerated product enables us to increase sales and earnings by increasing the number of shopping trips made by our customers in addition we accept food stamps under the supplemental nutrition assistance program “snap” in approximately 2900 qualified stores compared to 2200 at the end of 2008 

with the pressures of the current economic environment we have seen increases in the demand for basic consumable products in 2009 as a result we have shifted the mix of inventory carried in our stores to more consumer product merchandise which we believe increases the traffic in our stores and has helped to increase our sales even during the current economic downturn while this shift in mix has impacted our merchandise costs we were able to offset that impact in the current year with decreased costs for merchandise in many of our categories 

our pointofsale technology provides us with valuable sales and inventory information to assist our buyers and improve our merchandise allocation to our stores we believe that this has enabled us to better manage our inventory flow resulting in more efficient distribution and store operations and increased inventory turnover for each of the last five years inventory turnover improved by approximately 25 basis points in 2009 to over 4 turns for the year inventory per selling square foot also decreased 56 at january 30 2010 compared to january 31 2009 

   

in may 2007 legislation was enacted that increased the federal minimum wage the last increase to 725 an hour was effective in july 2009 as a result our wages have increased in the third quarter of 2009 and wages will continue to increase through the first half of 2010 however we believe that we can offset the increase in payroll costs through increased productivity and continued efficiencies in product flow to our stores 

we must continue to control our merchandise costs inventory levels and our general and administrative expenses increases in these line items could negatively impact our operating results 

  

  

results of operations 

the following table expresses items from our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales 

 

fiscal year ended january 30 2010 compared to fiscal year ended january 31 2009 

net sales  net sales increased 126 or 5863 million in 2009 compared to 2008 resulting from a 72 increase in comparable store net sales and sales in our new stores comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores which we include in the calculation and to a lesser extent are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing ones 

the following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store count for fiscal years ended january 30 2010 and january 31 2009 

 

of the 20 million selling square foot increase in 2009 approximately 03 million was added by expanding existing stores 

gross profit margin increased to 355 in 2009 compared to 343 in 2008 the increase was due to the following 

 

 

 

   

selling general and administrative expenses  selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 257 for 2009 compared to 264 for 2008 the decrease is primarily due to the following 

 

operating income  due to the reasons discussed above operating income margin was 98 in 2009 compared to 79 in 2008 

income taxes  our effective tax rate was 369 in 2009 compared to 361 in 2008 the higher rate in the current year was the result of the favorable settlement of several state tax audits in 2008 and a higher blended state tax rate in 2009 

fiscal year ended january 31 2009 compared to fiscal year ended february 2 2008 

net sales  net sales increased 95 or 4023 million in 2008 compared to 2007 resulting from sales in our new and expanded stores and a 41 increase in comparable store net sales comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores which we include in the calculation and to a lesser extent are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing ones 

the following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store count for fiscal years ended january 31 2009 and february 2 2008 

 

of the 19 million selling square foot increase in 2008 approximately 03 million was added by expanding existing stores 

gross profit  gross profit margin decreased to 343 in 2008 compared to 344 in 2007 the decrease was primarily due to a 30 basis point increase in merchandise cost including inbound freight resulting from an increase in the sales mix of higher cost consumer product merchandise and higher diesel fuel costs compared with 2007 partially offsetting this increase was a 20 basis point decrease in shrink expense due to favorable adjustments to shrink estimates based on actual inventory results during the year 

selling general and administrative expenses  selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 264 for 2008 compared to 266 for 2007 the decrease is primarily due to the following 

 

operating income  due to the reasons discussed above operating income margin was 79 in 2008 compared to 78 in 2007 

income taxes  our effective tax rate was 361 in 2008 compared to 371 in 2007 the lower rate in the 2008 reflects the recognition of certain tax benefits and a lower blended state tax rate resulting from the settlement of state tax audits in 2008 which allowed us to release income tax reserves and accrue less interest expense on tax uncertainties these benefits to the tax rate were partially offset by a reduction in taxexempt interest income in 2008 

liquidity and capital resources 

our business requires capital to build and open new stores expand our distribution network and operate existing stores our working capital requirements for existing stores are seasonal and usually reach their peak in september and october historically we have satisfied our seasonal working capital requirements for existing stores and have funded our store opening and distribution network expansion programs from internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities 

the following table compares cashflow related information for the years ended january 30 2010 january 31 2009 and february 2 2008 

 

net cash provided by operating activities increased 1779 million in 2009 compared to 2008 due to increased earnings before income taxes depreciation and amortization in the current year also providing more cash at january 30 2010 was better inventory management resulting in lower inventory balances per store and higher accounts payable balances due to the timing of payments and increased incentive compensation accruals 

 

net cash provided by operating activities increased 358 million in 2008 compared to 2007 due to increased earnings before income taxes depreciation and amortization in 2008 and lower prepaid rent amounts at the end of january 2009 february 2008 rent payments were made prior to the end of fiscal 2007 which resulted in a prepaid asset in fiscal 2007 whereas february 2009 rent was paid in fiscal 2009 

net cash used in investing activities increased 1105 million in the current year primarily due to shortterm investment activity and increased capital expenditures in 2009 in 2008 we liquidated our shortterm investments due to market conditions the net proceeds from this liquidation of 405 million were put into cash equivalent money market accounts in 2009 we also purchased 278 million of shortterm investments late in the year capital expenditures increased 335 million in 2009 primarily due to the purchase of our new distribution center in san bernardino ca we have spent approximately 310 million on this project through the end of fiscal 2009 and expect to spend approximately 60 million in the first quarter of 2010 to complete the project 

net cash used in investing activities increased 793 million in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 net proceeds from the sale of shortterm investments were higher in 2007 in order to fund share repurchases overall shortterm investment activity decreased in 2008 resulting from the liquidation of our shortterm investments early in 2008 due to market conditions these amounts were primarily invested in cash equivalent money market accounts partially offsetting the decrease in net proceeds from the sales of shortterm investments was higher capital expenditures 577 million higher in 2007 due to the expansions of the briar creek distribution center and corporate headquarters 

in 2009 net cash used in financing activities was 1613 million as a result of share repurchases of 1907 million partially offset by stock option exercises and employee stock plan purchases in the prior year net cash provided by financing activities was 227 million this was the result of stock option exercises and employee stock plan purchases 

in fiscal 2008 financing activities provided cash of 227 million as a result of stock option exercises and employee stock plan purchases in 2007 net cash used in financing activities was 3890 million this was the result of share repurchases of 4730 million for fiscal 2007 partially offset by stock option exercises resulting from the company’s stock price in 2008 being higher than it had been in the prior several years 

at january 30 2010 our longterm borrowings were 2675 million and our capital lease commitments were 03 million we also have 1215 million and 500 million letter of credit reimbursement and security agreements under which approximately 1018 million were committed to letters of credit issued for routine purchases of imported merchandise at january 30 2010 

on february 20 2008 we entered into a fiveyear 5500 million unsecured credit agreement the agreement the agreement provides for a 3000 million revolving line of credit including up to 1500 million in available letters of credit and a 2500 million term loan the interest rate on the agreement is based at our option on a libor rate plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin the revolving line of credit also bears a facilities fee calculated as a percentage as defined of the amount available under the line of credit payable quarterly the term loan is due and payable in full at the five year maturity date of the agreement the agreement also bears an administrative fee payable annually the agreement among other things requires the maintenance of certain specified financial ratios restricts the payment of certain distributions and prohibits the incurrence of certain new indebtedness as of january 30 2010 the 2500 million term loan is outstanding under the agreement and there were no amounts outstanding under the 3000 million revolving line of credit 

we repurchased approximately 43 million shares for approximately 1931 million in fiscal 2009 less than 01 million of these shares totaling 24 million had not settled as of january 30 2010 and these amounts have been accrued in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of january 30 2010 we repurchased 128 million shares for approximately 4730 million in fiscal 2007 we had no share repurchases in fiscal 2008 at january 30 2010 we have approximately 2606 million remaining under board authorization 

funding requirements 

overview 

we expect our cash needs for opening new stores and expanding existing stores in fiscal 2010 to total approximately 1360   million which includes capital expenditures initial inventory and preopening costs our estimated capital expenditures for fiscal 2010 are between 1550 and 1650 million including planned expenditures for our new and expanded stores and the addition of freezers and coolers to approximately 225 stores we believe that we can adequately fund our working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures for the next few years from net cash provided by operations and potential borrowings under our existing credit facility 

the following tables summarize our material contractual obligations at january 30 2010 including both on and offbalance sheet arrangements and our commitments including interest on longterm borrowings in millions 

 

 

 

  

  

lease financing 

operating lease obligations our operating lease obligations are primarily for payments under noncancelable store leases the commitment includes amounts for leases that were signed prior to january 30 2010 for stores that were not yet open on january 30 2010 

capital lease obligations  our capital lease obligations are primarily for distribution center equipment and computer equipment at the store support center 

credit agreement  on february 20 2008 we entered into a fiveyear 5500 million unsecured credit agreement the agreement the agreement provides for a 3000 million revolving line of credit including up to 1500 million in available letters of credit and a 2500 million term loan the interest rate on the facility will be based at our option on a libor rate plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin the interest rate on the facility was 074 at january 30 2010 the revolving line of credit also bears a facilities fee calculated as a percentage as defined of the amount available under the line of credit payable quarterly the term loan is due and payable in full at the five year maturity date of the agreement the agreement also bears an administrative fee payable annually the agreement among other things requires the maintenance of certain specified financial ratios restricts the payment of certain distributions and prohibits the incurrence of certain new indebtedness as of january 30 2010 we had the 2500 million term loan outstanding under the agreement and no amounts outstanding under the 3000 million revolving line of credit 

revenue bond financing  in may 1998 we entered into an agreement with the mississippi business finance corporation under which it issued 190 million of variablerate demand revenue bonds we used the proceeds from the bonds to finance the acquisition construction and installation of land buildings machinery and equipment for our distribution facility in olive branch mississippi at january 30 2010 the balance outstanding on the bonds was 175 million these bonds are due to be fully repaid in june 2018 the bonds do not have a prepayment penalty as long as the interest rate remains variable the bonds contain a demand provision and therefore outstanding amounts are classified as current liabilities we pay interest monthly based on a variable interest rate which was 025 at january 30 2010 

interest on longterm borrowings this amount represents interest payments on the credit agreement and the revenue bond financing using the interest rates for each at january 30 2010 

commitments 

letters of credit and surety bonds  in march 2001 we entered into a letter of credit reimbursement and security agreement which provides 1215 million for letters of credit in december 2004 we entered into an additional letter of credit reimbursement and security agreement which provides 500 million for letters of credit letters of credit are generally issued for the routine purchase of imported merchandise and we had approximately 1018 million of purchases committed under these letters of credit at january 30 2010 

we also have approximately 174 million of letters of credit or surety bonds outstanding for our selfinsurance programs and certain utility payment obligations at some of our stores 

freight contracts we have contracted outbound freight services from various carriers with contracts expiring through fiscal 2013 the total amount of these commitments is approximately 2962 million 

technology assets we have commitments totaling approximately 24 million to primarily purchase store technology assets for our stores during 2010 

derivative financial instruments 

on march 20 2008 we entered into two 750 million interest rate swap agreements these interest rate swaps are used to manage the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations on a portion of our 2500 million variable rate term loan under these agreements we pay interest to financial institutions at a fixed rate of 28 in exchange the financial institutions pay us at a variable rate which approximates the variable rate on the debt excluding the credit spread these swaps qualify for hedge accounting treatment and expire in march 2011 

in the fourth quarter of 2009 we entered into fuel derivative contracts with a third party as a result of these contracts we have fixed the fuel price on 24 million gallons of diesel fuel or approximately 25 of our fuel needs from may 2010 through january 2011 these derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and therefore all changes in fair value for these derivatives will be included directly in earnings 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates certain of our estimates require a high level of judgment and have the potential to have a material effect on the financial statements if actual results vary significantly   from those estimates following is a discussion of the estimates that we consider critical 

inventory valuation 

as discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weightedaverage basis cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weightedaverage basis under the retail inventory method the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated costtoretail ratio to the retail value of inventories since our inception through fiscal 2009 we have used one inventory pool for this calculation over the years we have invested in our retail technology systems which has allowed us to refine our estimate of inventory cost under the retail method on january 31 2010 the first day of fiscal 2010 we began using approximately 30 inventory pools in our retail inventory calculation as a result of this change we expect to record a noncash charge to gross profit and a corresponding reduction in inventory at cost of approximately 26 million in the first quarter of 2010 the retail inventory method is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis 

inventory valuation methods require certain significant management estimates and judgments including estimates of future merchandise markdowns and shrink which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins the averaging required in applying the retail inventory method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns could under certain circumstances result in costs not being recorded in the proper period 

we estimate our markdown reserve based on the consideration of a variety of factors including but not limited to quantities of slow moving or seasonal carryover merchandise on hand historical markdown statistics and future merchandising plans the accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors some of which are outside of our control including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends historically we have not experienced significant differences in our estimated reserve for markdowns compared with actual results 

our accrual for shrink is based on the actual historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories adjusted if necessary for current economic conditions these estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger our physical inventory counts are generally taken between january and september of each year therefore the shrink accrual recorded at january 30 2010 is based on estimated shrink for most of 2009 including the fourth quarter we have not experienced significant fluctuations in historical shrink rates beyond approximately 1020 basis points in our dollar tree stores for the last few years however we have sometimes experienced higher than typical shrink in acquired stores in the year following an acquisition we periodically adjust our shrink estimates to address these factors as they become apparent 

our management believes that our application of the retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market each year on a consistent basis 

accrued expenses 

on a monthly basis we estimate certain expenses in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred our most material estimates include domestic freight expenses selfinsurance costs storelevel operating expenses such as property taxes and utilities and certain other expenses such as legal reserves our freight and storelevel operating expenses are estimated based on current activity and historical trends and results our workers compensation and general liability insurance accruals are recorded based on actuarial valuations which are adjusted at least annually based on a review performed by a thirdparty actuary these actuarial valuations are estimates based on our historical loss development factors certain other expenses are estimated and recorded in the periods that management becomes aware of them the related accruals are adjusted as management’s estimates change differences in managements estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual materially different from the calculated accrual our experience has been that some of our estimates are too high and others are too low historically the net total of these differences has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations our legal proceedings are described in item 3 “legal proceedings” beginning on page 14 of this form 10k the outcome of litigation particularly class or collective action lawsuits is difficult to assess quantify or predict 

income taxes 

on a quarterly basis we estimate our required income tax liability and assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets our income taxes payable are estimated based on enacted tax rates including estimated tax rates in states where our store base is growing applied to the income expected to be taxed currently management assesses the recoverability of deferred tax assets based on the availability of carrybacks of future deductible amounts and management’s projections for future taxable income we cannot guarantee that we will generate taxable income in future years historically we have not experienced significant differences in our estimates of our tax accrual 

in addition we have a recorded liability for our estimate of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns judgment is required in evaluating the application of federal and state tax laws including relevant case law and assessing whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination and if so judgment is also required as to the measurement of the amount of tax benefit that will be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or the final outcome differs from the amounts recorded we believe that our liability for uncertain tax positions is adequate for further discussion of our changes in reserves during 2009 see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data  note 3 to the consolidated financial statements” beginning on page 39 of this form 10k 

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations 

we experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales comparable store net sales operating income and net income and expect this trend to continue our results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors including 

 

our highest sales periods are the christmas and easter seasons easter was observed on march 23 2008 april 12 2009 and will be observed on april 4 2010 we believe that the earlier easter in 2010 could result in a 100 million decrease in sales in the first quarter of 2010 as compared to the first quarter of 2009 we generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and of our operating and net income during the fourth quarter in anticipation of increased sales activity during these months we purchase substantial amounts of inventory and hire a significant number of temporary employees to supplement our continuing store staff our operating results particularly operating and net income could suffer if our net sales were below seasonal norms during the fourth quarter or during the easter season for any reason including merchandise delivery delays due to receiving or distribution problems consumer sentiment or inclement weather 

our unaudited results of operations for the eight most recent quarters are shown in a table in footnote 11 of the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

inflation and other economic factors 

our ability to provide quality merchandise at a fixed price and on a profitable basis may be subject to economic factors and influences that we cannot control consumer spending could decline because of economic pressures including unemployment and rising fuel prices reductions in consumer confidence and spending could have an adverse effect on our sales national or international events including war or terrorism could lead to disruptions in economies in the united states or in foreign countries where we purchase some of our merchandise these and other factors could increase our merchandise costs and other costs that are critical to our operations such as shipping and wage rates 

shipping costs  currently transpacific shipping rates are negotiated with individual freight lines and are subject to fluctuation based on supply and demand for containers and current fuel costs  we can give no assurances as to the final actual rates for 2010 as we are in the early stages of our negotiations 

minimum wage on may 25 2007 legislation was enacted that increased the federal minimum wage from 515 an hour to 725 an hour in july 2009 as a result our wages increased in 2009 and will continue to increase through the first half of 2010 however we believe that we can partially offset the increase in payroll costs through increased productivity and continued efficiencies in product flow to our stores 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of our business including the impact of interest rate changes and diesel fuel cost changes we may enter into interest rate or diesel fuel swaps to manage exposure to interest rate and diesel fuel price changes we do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging and we do not hold derivative instruments for trading purposes 

interest rate risk 

we use variablerate debt to finance certain of our operations and capital improvements these obligations expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates if interest rates increase interest expense increases conversely if interest rates decrease interest expense also decreases we believe it is beneficial to limit the variability of our interest payments 

to meet this objective we entered into derivative instruments in the form of interest rate swaps to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in the variableinterest rates on a portion of our 2500 million term loan the interest rate swaps reduce the interest rate exposure on these variablerate obligations under the interest rate swaps we pay the bank at a fixedrate and receive variableinterest at a rate approximating the variablerate on the obligation thereby creating the economic equivalent of a fixedrate obligation we entered into two 750 million interest rate swap agreements in march 2008 to manage the risk associated with the interest rate fluctuations on a portion of our 2500 million variable rate term loan 

the following table summarizes the financial terms of our interest rate swap agreements and the fair value of the interest rate swaps at january 30 2010 

 

hypothetically a 1 change in interest rates results in an approximate 15 million change in the amount paid or received under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement on an annual basis due to many factors management is not able to predict the changes in the fair values of our interest rate swaps these fair values are obtained from our outside financial institutions 

diesel fuel cost risk 

in order to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in diesel fuel costs we entered into fuel derivative contracts with a third party in the fourth quarter of 2009 for 24 million gallons of diesel fuel or approximately 25 of our fuel needs from may 2010 through january 2011 under these contracts we pay the third party a fixed price for diesel fuel and receive variable diesel fuel prices at amounts approximating current diesel fuel costs thereby creating the economic equivalent of a fixedrate obligation these derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and therefore all changes in fair value for this derivative will be included directly in earnings the fair value of these contracts at january 30 2010 was a liability of 02 million

dollar tree inc 

 

we have audited dollar tree inc’s internal control over financial reporting as of january 30 2010 based on criteria established in internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso dollar tree inc’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

 

  

  

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

 

in our opinion dollar tree inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of january 30 2010 based on criteria established in internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission

 item 1  business 

overview 

we are the leading operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise at the fixed price of 100 we believe the variety and quality of products we sell for 100 sets us apart from our competitors at january 31 2009 we operated 3591 discount variety retail stores approximately 3450 of these stores sell substantially all items for 100 or less the remaining stores operating as deal which were acquired in or opened subsequent to march 2006 sell most items for 100 or less but also sell items for more than 1 our stores operate under the names of dollar tree deal and dollar bills 

 

we believe our optimal store is between 8000 and 10000 selling square feet this store size reflects our expanded merchandise offerings and improved service to our customers as we have been expanding our merchandise offerings we have added freezers and coolers to approximately 1200 stores during the past four years to increase traffic and transaction size at january 29 2005 we operated 2735 stores in 48 states at january 31 2009 we operated 3591 stores in 48 states our selling square footage increased from approximately 204 million square feet in january 2005 to 303 million square feet in january 2009 our store growth has resulted primarily from opening new stores with additional growth from mergers and acquisitions such as deal 

business strategy 

value merchandise offering  we strive to exceed our customers expectations of the variety and quality of products that they can purchase for 100 by offering items that we believe typically sell for higher prices elsewhere we buy approximately 55 to 60 of our merchandise domestically and import the remaining 40 to 45 our domestic purchases include closeouts we believe our mix of imported and domestic merchandise affords our buyers flexibility that allows them to consistently exceed the customers expectations in addition direct relationships with manufacturers permit us to select from a broad range of products and customize packaging product sizes and package quantities that meet our customers needs 

mix of basic variety and seasonal merchandise we maintain a balanced selection of products within traditional variety store categories we offer a wide selection of everyday basic products and we supplement these basic everyday items with seasonal and closeout merchandise we attempt to keep certain basic consumable merchandise in our stores continuously to establish our stores as a destination and we have slightly increased the mix of consumable merchandise in order to increase the traffic in our stores closeout merchandise is purchased opportunistically and represents less than 10 of our purchases 

our merchandise mix consists of 

 

we have added freezers and coolers to certain stores and increased consumable merchandise carried by those stores we believe this initiative helps drive additional transactions and allows us to appeal to a broader demographic mix we have added freezers and coolers to approximately 150 more stores in 2008 therefore as of january 31 2009 we have freezers and coolers in approximately 1200 of our stores we plan to add them to approximately 175 more stores in 2009 as a result of the installation of freezers and coolers in select stores consumable merchandise has grown as a percentage of purchases and sales and we expect this trend to continue the following table shows the percentage of purchases of each major product group for the years ended january 31 2009 and february 2 2008 

 

at any point in time we carry approximately 5000 items in our stores and as of the end of 2008 approximately 1300 of the basic everyday items are on automatic replenishment the remaining items are primarily ordered by our store managers on a weekly basis through automatic replenishment and our store managers’ ability to order product each store manager is able to satisfy the demands of their particular customer base 

 

customer payment methods all of our stores accept cash checks debit cards visa credit cards and discover and approximately 1100 stores accept mastercard credit cards  by the end of 2006 all of our stores accepted debit cards we began accepting visa credit cards at all of our stores in the fourth quarter of 2007 along with the shift to more consumables the rollout of freezers and coolers and the acceptance of pinbased debit and visa credit transactions we increased the number of stores accepting electronic benefits transferebt cards and food stamps in 2008 at january 31 2009 we accept ebt and food stamps at approximately 2200 stores we believe that expanding our tender types has increased both the traffic and the average size of transactions at our stores in the year subsequent to implementation 

 

convenient locations and store size we primarily focus on opening new stores in strip shopping centers anchored by mass merchandisers whose target customers we believe to be similar to ours our stores have proven successful in metropolitan areas midsized cities and small towns the range of our store sizes allows us to target a particular location with a store that best suits that market and takes advantage of available real estate opportunities our stores are attractively designed and create an inviting atmosphere for shoppers by using bright lighting vibrant colors decorative signs and background music we enhance the store design with attractive merchandise displays we believe this design attracts new and repeat customers and enhances our image as both a destination and impulse purchase store 

for more information on retail locations and retail store leases see item 2 properties” beginning on page 13 of this form 10k 

 

profitable stores with strong cash flow we maintain a disciplined costsensitive approach to store site selection in order to minimize the initial capital investment required and maximize our potential to generate high operating margins and strong cash flows we believe that our stores have a relatively small shopping radius which allows us to profitably concentrate multiple stores within a single market our ability to open new stores is dependent upon among other factors locating suitable sites and negotiating favorable lease terms 

 

the strong cash flows generated by our stores allow us to selffund infrastructure investment and new stores over the past five years cash flows from operating activities have exceeded capital expenditures 

 

for more information on our results of operations see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” beginning on page 19 of this form 10k 

cost control  we believe that our substantial buying power at the 100 price point and our flexibility in making sourcing decisions contributes to our successful purchasing strategy which includes disciplined targeted merchandise margin goals by category we also believe our ability to select quality merchandise helps to minimize markdowns we buy products on an orderbyorder basis and have no material longterm purchase contracts or other assurances of continued product supply or guaranteed product cost no vendor accounted for more than 10 of total merchandise purchased in any of the past five years 

 

our supply chain systems continue to provide us with valuable sales information to assist our buyers and improve merchandise allocation to our stores controlling our inventory levels has resulted in more efficient distribution and store operations 

 

information systems we believe that investments in technology help us to increase sales and control costs our inventory management system has allowed us to improve the efficiency of our supply chain improve merchandise flow increase inventory turnover and control distribution and store operating costs our automatic replenishment system automatically reorders key items based on actual store level sales and inventory at the end of 2008 we had over 1300 basic everyday items on automatic replenishment 

pointofsale data allows us to track sales and inventory by merchandise category at the store level and assists us in planning for future purchases of inventory we believe that this information allows us to ship the appropriate product to stores at the quantities commensurate with selling patterns using this pointofsale data for planning purchases of inventory has helped us decrease our inventory per square foot in the current year our inventory turns also increased 5 basis points in 2008 after a 25 basis point increase in 2007 inventory turnover has increased in each of the last four years 

 

corporate culture and values we believe that honesty and integrity doing the right things for the right reasons and treating people fairly and with respect are core values within our corporate culture we believe that running a business and certainly a public company carries with it a responsibility to be above reproach when making operational and financial decisions our executive management team visits and shops our stores like every customer and ideas and individual creativity on the part of our associates are encouraged particularly from our store managers who know their stores and their customers we have standards for store displays merchandise presentation and store operations we maintain an open door policy for all associates our distribution centers are operated based on objective measures of performance and virtually everyone in our store support center is available to assist associates in the stores and distribution centers 

 

our disclosure committee meets at least quarterly and monitors our internal controls over financial reporting and ensures that our public filings contain discussions about the risks our business faces we believe that we have the controls in place to be able to certify our financial statements additionally we have complied with the updated listing requirements for the nasdaq stock market 

growth strategy 

store openings and square footage growth the primary factors contributing to our net sales growth have been new store openings an active store expansion and remodel program and selective mergers and acquisitions in the last five years net sales increased at a compound annual growth rate of 104 we expect that the majority of our future sales growth will come primarily from new store openings and from our store expansion and relocation program 

 

the following table shows the total selling square footage of our stores and the selling square footage per new store opened over the last five years our growth and productivity statistics are reported based on selling square footage because our management believes the use of selling square footage yields a more accurate measure of store productivity the selling square footage statistics for 2004 through 2008 are estimates based on the relationship of selling to gross square footage 

 

we expect to increase our selling square footage in the future by opening new stores in underserved markets and strategically increasing our presence in our existing markets via new store openings and store expansions expansions include store relocations in fiscal 2009 and beyond we plan to predominantly open stores that are approximately 8000  10000 selling square feet and we believe this size allows us to achieve our objectives in the markets in which we plan to expand at january 31 2009 1680 of our stores totaling 610 of our selling square footage were 8100 selling square feet or larger  

 

in addition to new store openings we plan to continue our store expansion program to increase our net sales per store and take advantage of market opportunities we target stores for expansion based on the current sales per selling square foot and changes in market opportunities stores targeted for expansion are generally less than 6000 selling square feet in size store expansions generally increase the existing store size by approximately 4000 selling square feet 

since 1995 we have added a total of 609 stores through four mergers and several small acquisitions our acquisition strategy has been to target companies that have a similar singleprice point concept that has shown success in operations or companies that provide a strategic advantage we evaluate potential acquisition opportunities in our retail sector as they become available 

 

on march 25 2006 we completed our acquisition of 138 deal stores which included stores that offered an expanded assortment of merchandise including items that sell for more than 1 these stores provide us an opportunity to leverage our dollar tree infrastructure in the testing of new merchandise concepts including higher price points without disrupting the singleprice point model in our dollar tree stores 

since the acquisition we have opened new deal stores including some in new markets and operate 143 deal stores as of january 31 2009 

 

from time to time we also acquire the rights to store leases through bankruptcy proceedings of certain discount retailers we will take advantage of these opportunities as they arise in the future 

 

merchandising and distribution expanding our customer base is important to our growth plans we plan to continue to stock our new stores with the everchanging merchandise that our current customers have come to appreciate consumable merchandise typically leads to more frequent return trips to our stores resulting in increased sales the presentation and display of merchandise in our stores are critical to communicating value to our customers and creating a more exciting shopping experience we believe our approach to visual merchandising results in higher store traffic higher sales volume and an environment that encourages impulse purchases 

 

a strong and efficient distribution network is critical to our ability to grow and to maintain a lowcost operating structure we believe our distribution centers in total are capable of supporting approximately 67 billion in annual sales new distribution sites are strategically located to reduce stem miles maintain flexibility and improve efficiency in our store service areas 

 

our stores receive approximately 90 of their inventory from our distribution centers via contract carriers the remaining store inventory primarily perishable consumable items and other vendormaintained display items are delivered directly to our stores from vendors for more information on our distribution center network see item 2 “properties” beginning on page 13 of this form 10k 

competition 

the retail industry is highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future the principal methods of competition include closeout merchandise convenience and the quality of merchandise offered to the customer we operate in the discount retail merchandise business which is currently and is expected to continue to be highly competitive with respect to price store location merchandise quality assortment and presentation and customer service our competitors include singleprice dollar stores multiprice dollar stores mass merchandisers discount retailers and variety retailers in addition several mass merchandisers and grocery store chains carry dollar store or “dollar zone” concepts in their stores which increases competition we believe we differentiate ourselves from other retailers by providing high value high quality low cost merchandise in attractively designed stores that are conveniently located our sales and profits could be reduced by increases in competition especially because there are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector 

trademarks 

we are the owners of several federal service mark registrations including dollar tree the dollar tree logo the dollar tree logo with a “1”  and one priceone dollar we also own a concurrent use registration for dollar bill and the related logo during 1997 we acquired the rights to use trade names previously owned by everythings a dollar a former competitor in the 100 price point industry several trade names were included in the purchase including the marks everythings 100 we mean everything and everythings 100 the registration of which is pending with the acquisition of deal we became the owners of the trademark “deal” and we have since registered “deals 5 and less” we have federal trademark registrations for a variety of private labels that we use to market some of our product lines 

employees 

we employed approximately 12560 fulltime and 33280 parttime associates on january 31 2009 parttime associates work 35 hours per week or less the number of parttime associates fluctuates depending on seasonal needs we consider our relationship with our associates to be good and we have not experienced significant interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements 




 item 1a  risk factors 

an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk any failure to meet market expectations including our comparable store sales growth rate earnings and earnings per share or new store openings could cause the market price of our stock to decline you should carefully consider the specific risk factors listed below together with all other information included or incorporated in this report any of the following risks may materialize and additional risks not known to us or that we now deem immaterial may arise in such event our business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected 

a continued downturn in economic conditions could adversely affect our sales 

further deterioration in economic conditions such as those caused by the recession inflation higher unemployment consumer debt levels lack of available credit cost increases as well as adverse weather conditions or terrorism could reduce consumer spending or cause customers to shift their spending to products we either do not sell or do not sell as profitably adverse economic conditions could disrupt consumer spending and significantly reduce our sales decrease our inventory turnover cause greater markdowns or reduce our profitability due to lower margins 

our profitability is especially vulnerable to cost increases 

future increase in costs such as the cost of merchandise wage levels shipping rates freight costs fuel costs and store occupancy costs may reduce our profitability as a fixed price retailer we cannot raise the sale price of our merchandise to offset cost increases unlike multiprice retailers we are primarily dependent on our ability to operate more efficiently or effectively or increase our comparable store net sales in order to offset inflation we can give you no assurance that we will be able to operate more efficiently or increase our comparable store net sales in the future please see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations beginning on page 19 of this form 10k for further discussion of the effect of inflation and other economic factors on our operations 

changes in federal state or local law or our failure to comply with such laws could increase our expenses and expose us to legal risks 

our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations significant legislative changes such as the proposed employee free choice act that impact our relationship with our workforce could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations changes in other regulatory areas such as consumer credit privacy and information security product safety or environmental protection among others could cause our expenses to increase in addition if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations particularly wage and hour laws we could be subject to legal risk including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation which could adversely affect our results of operations changes in tax laws the interpretation of existing laws or our failure to sustain our reporting positions on examination could adversely affect our effective tax rate 

for a discussion of current legal matters please see item 3 “legal proceedings” beginning on page 14 of this form 10k resolution of certain matters described in that item if decided against the company could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations accrued liabilities or cash flows 

we could encounter disruptions or additional costs in obtaining and distributing merchandise 

our success depends on the ability of our vendors to supply merchandise and our ability to transport merchandise to our distribution centers and then ship it to our stores in a timely and costeffective manner we may not anticipate respond to or control all of the challenges of operating our receiving and distribution systems additionally if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments we could experience merchandise shortages that could lead to lost sales some of the factors that could have an adverse effect on our supply chain systems or costs are 

 

 

 

 

sales below our expectations during peak seasons may cause our operating results to suffer materially 

our highest sales periods are the christmas and easter seasons we generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and a substantial majority of our operating and net income during the fourth quarter in anticipation we stock extra inventory and hire many temporary employees to prepare our stores a reduction in sales during these periods could adversely affect our operating results particularly operating and net income to a greater extent than if a reduction occurred at other times of the year untimely merchandise delays due to receiving or distribution problems could have a similar effect sales during the easter selling season are materially affected by the timing of the easter holiday easter in fiscal 2009 is on april 12th while in fiscal 2008 it was three weeks earlier on march 23 rd  we believe that the later easter in 2009 could potentially result in 250 million of increased sales in the first quarter of 2009 when compared to the first quarter of 2008 

our sales and profits rely on imported merchandise which may increase in cost or become unavailable 

merchandise imported directly from overseas accounts for approximately 40 to 45 of our total purchases at retail in addition we believe that a small portion of our goods purchased from domestic vendors is imported china is the source of a substantial majority of our imports imported goods are generally less expensive than domestic goods and increase our profit margins a disruption in the flow of our imported merchandise or an increase in the cost of those goods may significantly decrease our profits risks associated with our reliance on imported goods include 

 

we may be unable to expand our square footage as profitably as planned 

we plan to expand our selling square footage by approximately 65 in 2009 to increase our sales and profits expanding our square footage profitably depends on a number of uncertainties including our ability to locate lease build out and open or expand stores in suitable locations on a timely basis under favorable economic terms in addition our expansion is dependent upon thirdparty developers’ abilities to acquire land obtain financing and secure necessary permits and approvals turmoil in the financial markets has made it difficult for third party developers to obtain financing for new projects we must also open or expand stores within our established geographic markets where new or expanded stores may draw sales away from our existing stores we may not manage our expansion effectively and our failure to achieve our expansion plans could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our profitability is affected by the mix of products we sell 

our gross profit could decrease if we increase the proportion of higher cost goods we sell in the future in recent years the percentage of our sales from higher cost consumable products has increased and is likely to increase slightly in 2009 as a result our gross profit will decrease unless we are able to maintain our current merchandise cost sufficiently to offset any decrease in our product margin percentage we can give you no assurance that we will be able to do so 

pressure from competitors may reduce our sales and profits 

the retail industry is highly competitive the marketplace is highly fragmented as many different retailers compete for market share by utilizing a variety of store formats and merchandising strategies we expect competition to increase in the future because there are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector many of our current or potential competitors have greater financial resources than we do we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors please see item 1 “business” beginning on page 6 of this form 10k for further discussion of the effect of competition on our operations 

certain provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws could delay or discourage a takeover attempt that may be in a shareholders best interest 

our articles of incorporation and bylaws currently contain provisions that may delay or discourage a takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider in his best interest these provisions among other things 

 

however we believe that these provisions allow our board of directors to negotiate a higher price in the event of a takeover attempt which would be in the best interest of our shareholders

 item 2 properties 

stores 

as of january 31 2009 we operated 3591 stores in 48 states as detailed below 

 

we currently lease our stores and expect to continue to lease new stores as we expand our leases typically provide for a short initial lease term generally five years with options to extend however in some cases we have initial lease terms of seven to ten years we believe this leasing strategy enhances our flexibility to pursue various expansion opportunities resulting from changing market conditions as current leases expire we believe that we will be able to obtain lease renewals if desired for present store locations or to obtain leases for equivalent or better locations in the same general area 

distribution centers 

the following table includes information about the distribution centers that we currently operate we believe our distribution center network is capable of supporting approximately 67 billion in annual sales

our net sales are derived from the sale of merchandise two major factors tend to affect our net sales trends first is our success at opening new stores or adding new stores through acquisitions second sales vary at our existing stores from one year to the next we refer to this change as a change in comparable store net sales because we compare only those stores that are open throughout both of the periods being compared we include sales from stores expanded during the year in the calculation of comparable store net sales which has the effect of increasing our comparable store net sales the term expanded also includes stores that are relocated 

at january 31 2009 we operated 3591 stores in 48 states with 303 million selling square feet compared to 3411 stores with 284 million selling square feet at february 2 2008 during fiscal 2008 we opened 231 stores expanded 86 stores and closed 51 stores compared to 240 new stores opened 102 stores expanded and 48 stores closed during fiscal 2007 in the current year we increased our selling square footage by 67 of the 19 million selling square foot increase in 2008 03 million was added by expanding existing stores the average size of our stores opened in 2008 was approximately 8100 selling square feet or about 10300 gross square feet the average new store size decreased slightly in 2008 from approximately 8500 selling square feet or about 10800 gross square feet for new stores in 2007 for 2009 we continue to plan to open stores that are approximately 8000  10000 selling square feet or about 10000  12000 gross square feet we believe that this store size is our optimal size operationally and that this size also gives our customers an ideal shopping environment that invites them to shop longer and buy more we expect the majority of our future net sales growth to come from the square footage growth resulting from new store openings and expansion of existing stores 

fiscal 2006 ended on february 3 2007 and included 53 weeks commensurate with the retail calendar the 53 rd week in 2006 added approximately 70 million in sales fiscal 2008 and 2007 ended on january 31 2009 and february 2 2008 respectively and both years included 52 weeks 

in fiscal 2008 comparable store net sales increased by 41 the comparable store net sales increase was the result of increases of 37 in the number of transactions and a 04 increase in average transaction size we believe comparable store net sales continue to be positively affected by a number of our initiatives including expansion of forms of payment accepted by our stores and the rollout of freezers and coolers to more of our stores at january 31 2009 we had frozen and refrigerated merchandise in approximately 1200 stores compared to approximately 1100 stores at february 2 2008 we believe that this enables us to increase sales and earnings by increasing the number of shopping trips made by our customers and increasing the average transaction size in addition we now accept food stamps in approximately 2200 qualified stores compared to 1000 at the end of 2007 beginning october 31 2007 all of our stores accept visa credit which has had a positive impact on our sales for fiscal 2008 

with the pressures of the current economic environment we have seen an increase in the demand for basic consumable merchandise in 2008 as a result we have shifted the mix of inventory carried in our stores to more consumer product merchandise which we believe increases the traffic in our stores and has helped to increase our sales even during the current economic downturn this shift has negatively impacted our margins in 2008 and we believe that this increase in basic consumer product merchandise will negatively impact our margins in the first half of 2009 

our pointofsale technology provides us with valuable sales and inventory information to assist our buyers and improve our merchandise allocation to our stores we believe that this has enabled us to better manage our inventory flow resulting in more efficient distribution and store operations and increased inventory turnover for each of the last two years inventory turnover improved by approximately 5 basis points in 2008 compared to 2007 and by approximately 25 basis points in 2007 compared to 2006 fiscal 2008 was the fourth consecutive year of increased inventory turnover inventory per selling square foot also decreased 12 at january 31 2009 compared to february 2 2008 

on may 25 2007 legislation was enacted that increased the federal minimum wage from 515 an hour to 725 an hour by july 2009 as a result our wages will increase in 2009 however we believe that we can partially offset the increase in payroll costs through increased store productivity and continued efficiencies in product flow to our stores 

we must continue to control our merchandise costs inventory levels and our general and administrative expenses increases in these line items could negatively impact our operating results 

on march 25 2006 we completed our acquisition of 138 deal stores which included stores that offered an expanded assortment of merchandise including items that sell for more than 1 most of these stores continue to operate under the deal banner while providing us an opportunity to leverage our dollar tree infrastructure in the testing of new merchandise concepts including higher price points without disrupting the singleprice point model in our dollar tree stores we have opened new deal stores including some in new markets and as of january 31 2009 we have 143 stores under the deal banner that are selling most items for 1 or less but also sell items for more than 1 compared to 131 stores at february 2 2008 

  

  

results of operations 

the following table expresses items from our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales 

 

fiscal year ended january 31 2009 compared to fiscal year ended february 2 2008 

net sales  net sales increased 95 or 4023 million in 2008 compared to 2007 resulting from sales in our new and expanded stores and a 41 increase in comparable store net sales comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores which we include in the calculation and to a lesser extent are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing ones 

the following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store count for fiscal years ended january 31 2009 and february 2 2008 

 

of the 19 million selling square foot increase in 2008 approximately 03 million was added by expanding existing stores 

gross profit  gross profit margin decreased to 343 in 2008 compared to 344 in 2007 the decrease was primarily due to a 30 basis point increase in merchandise cost including inbound freight resulting from an increase in the sales mix of higher cost consumer product merchandise and higher diesel fuel costs compared with 2007 partially offsetting this increase was a 20 basis point decrease in shrink expense due to favorable adjustments to shrink estimates based on actual inventory results during the year 

  

  

selling general and administrative expenses  selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 264 for 2008 compared to 266 for 2007 the decrease is primarily due to the following 

 

operating income  due to the reasons discussed above operating income margin was 79 in 2008 compared to 78 in 2007 

income taxes  our effective tax rate was 361 in 2008 compared to 371 in 2007 the lower rate in the current year reflects the recognition of certain tax benefits in accordance with financial accounting standards board’s financial interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 48  and a lower blended state tax rate resulting from the settlement of state tax audits in the current year which allowed us to release income tax reserves and accrue less interest expense on tax uncertainties in the current year these benefits to the tax rate were partially offset by a reduction in taxexempt interest income in the current year 

fiscal year ended february 2 2008 compared to fiscal year ended february 2 2007 

net sales  net sales increased 69 or 2732 million in 2007 compared to 2006 resulting primarily from sales in our new and expanded stores our sales increase was also impacted by a 27 increase in comparable store net sales for 2007 this increase is based on the comparable 52weeks for both years these increases were partially offset by an extra week of sales in 2006 due to the 53week retail calendar for 2006 on a comparative 52week basis sales increased approximately 88 in 2007 compared to 2006 comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores which we include in the calculation and to a lesser extent are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing ones 

the following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store count for fiscal years ended february 2 2008 and february 3 2007 

 

of the 21 million selling square foot increase in 2007 approximately 04 million was added by expanding existing stores 

gross profit  gross profit margin increased to 344 in 2007 compared to 342 in 2006 the increase was primarily due to a 50 basis point decrease in merchandise cost including inbound freight due to improved initial markup in many categories in 2007 this decrease was partially offset by a 40 basis point increase in occupancy costs due to the loss of leverage from the extra week of sales in 2006 

  

  

selling general and administrative expenses  selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 266 for 2007 compared to 264 for 2006 the increase is primarily due to the following 

 

operating income  due to the reasons discussed above operating income margin was 78 in 2007 and 2006 

income taxes  our effective tax rate was 371 in 2007 compared to 366 in 2006 the increase in the rate for 2007 reflects a reduction of taxexempt interest income in the current year due to lower investment levels resulting from increased share repurchase activity and an increase in tax reserves in accordance with fin 48 these increases more than offset a slight decrease in our net state tax rate 

liquidity and capital resources 

our business requires capital to build and open new stores expand our distribution network and operate existing stores our working capital requirements for existing stores are seasonal and usually reach their peak in september and october historically we have satisfied our seasonal working capital requirements for existing stores and have funded our store opening and distribution network expansion programs from internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities 

the following table compares cashrelated information for the years ended january 31 2009 february 2 2008 and february 3 2007 

 

 

net cash provided by operating activities increased 358 million compared to last year due to increased earnings before income taxes depreciation and amortization in the current year and lower prepaid rent amounts at the end of january 2009 february 2008 rent payments were made prior to the end of fiscal 2007 which resulted in a prepaid asset in fiscal 2007 whereas february 2009 rent was paid in fiscal 2009 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased 455 million in 2007 compared to 2006 due to increased working capital requirements in 2007 and increases in the provision for deferred taxes partially offset by improved earnings before depreciation and amortization in 2007 

net cash used in investing activities increased 793 million in the current year net proceeds from the sale of shortterm investments were higher in the prior year in order to fund share repurchases overall shortterm investment activity has decreased in the current year resulting from the liquidation of our shortterm investments early in the current year due to market conditions these amounts were primarily invested in cash equivalent money market accounts partially offsetting the decrease in net proceeds from the sales of shortterm investments was higher capital expenditures 577 million higher in the prior year due to the expansions of the briar creek distribution center and corporate headquarters 

net cash used in investing activities decreased 1680 million in 2007 compared to 2006 this decrease is due to 1291 million of increased proceeds from shortterm investment activity in 2007 to fund increased share repurchases and 541 million used in 2006 to acquire deal assets these were partially offset by increased capital expenditures in 2007 resulting from the briar creek distribution center and the corporate headquarters expansions 

in the current year financing activities provided cash of 227 million as a result of stock option exercises and employee stock plan purchases in the prior year net cash used in financing activities was 3890 million this was the result of share repurchases of 4730 million for fiscal 2007 partially offset by stock option exercises resulting from the company’s stock price last year being higher than it had been in the prior several years 

net cash used in financing activities increased 1861 million in 2007 due primarily to increased share repurchases in 2007 partially offset by increased proceeds from stock option exercises in 2007 resulting from the company’s higher stock price earlier in the year 

at january 31 2009 our longterm borrowings were 2676 million and our capital lease commitments were 06 million we also have 1215 million and 500 million letter of credit reimbursement and security agreements under which approximately 978 million were committed to letters of credit issued for routine purchases of imported merchandise at january 31 2009 

on february 20 2008 we entered into a fiveyear 5500 million unsecured credit agreement the agreement the agreement provides for a 3000 million revolving line of credit including up to 1500 million in available letters of credit and a 2500 million term loan the interest rate on the agreement is based at our option on a libor rate plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin the revolving line of credit also bears a facilities fee calculated as a percentage as defined of the amount available under the line of credit payable quarterly the term loan is due and payable in full at the five year maturity date of the agreement the agreement also bears an administrative fee payable annually the agreement among other things requires the maintenance of certain specified financial ratios restricts the payment of certain distributions and prohibits the incurrence of certain new indebtedness our march 2004 4500 million unsecured revolving credit facility was terminated concurrent with entering into the agreement as of january 31 2009 the 2500 million term loan is outstanding under the agreement 

in march 2005 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 3000 million of our common stock through march 2008 in november 2006 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 5000 million of our common stock this amount was in addition to the 270 million remaining on the march 2005 authorization then in october 2007 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 5000 million of our common stock this authorization was in addition to the november 2006 authorization which had approximately 984 million remaining at the time 

we repurchased approximately 128 million shares for approximately 4730 million in fiscal 2007 and approximately 88 million shares for approximately 2482 million in fiscal 2006 we had no share repurchases in fiscal 2008 at january 31 2009 we have approximately 4537 million remaining under board authorization 

funding requirements 

overview 

we expect our cash needs for opening new stores and expanding existing stores in fiscal 2009 to total approximately 1381   million which includes capital expenditures initial inventory and preopening costs our estimated capital expenditures for fiscal 2009 are between 1350 and 1450 million including planned expenditures for our new and expanded stores and the addition of freezers and coolers to approximately 175 stores we believe that we can adequately fund our working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures for the next few years from net cash provided by operations and potential borrowings under our existing credit facility 

  

  

the following tables summarize our material contractual obligations at january 31 2009 including both on and offbalance sheet arrangements and our commitments including interest on longterm borrowings in millions 

 

 

lease financing 

operating lease obligations our operating lease obligations are primarily for payments under noncancelable store leases the commitment includes amounts for leases that were signed prior to january 31 2009 for stores that were not yet open on january 31 2009 

capital lease obligations  our capital lease obligations are primarily for distribution center equipment and computer equipment at the store support center 

credit agreement  on february 20 2008 we entered into a fiveyear 5500 million unsecured credit agreement the agreement the agreement provides for a 3000 million revolving line of credit including up to 1500 million in available letters of credit and a 2500 million term loan the interest rate on the facility will be based at our option on a libor rate plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin this rate was 121 at january 31 2009 the revolving line of credit also bears a facilities fee calculated as a percentage as defined of the amount available under the line of credit payable quarterly the term loan is due and payable in full at the five year maturity date of the agreement the agreement also bears an administrative fee payable annually the agreement among other things requires the maintenance of certain specified financial ratios restricts the payment of certain distributions and prohibits the incurrence of certain new indebtedness as of january 31 2009 we had 2500 million outstanding on the agreement our march 2004 4500 million unsecured revolving credit facility was terminated concurrent with entering into the agreement 

revenue bond financing  in may 1998 we entered into an agreement with the mississippi business finance corporation under which it issued 190 million of variablerate demand revenue bonds we used the proceeds from the bonds to finance the acquisition construction and installation of land buildings machinery and equipment for our distribution facility in olive branch mississippi at january 31 2009 the balance outstanding on the bonds was 176 million these bonds are due to be fully repaid in june 2018 the bonds do not have a prepayment penalty as long as the interest rate remains variable the bonds contain a demand provision and therefore outstanding amounts are classified as current liabilities we pay interest monthly based on a variable interest rate which was 150 at january 31 2009 

interest on longterm borrowings this amount represents interest payments on the credit agreement and the revenue bond financing using the interest rates for each at january 31 2009 

commitments 

letters of credit and surety bonds  in march 2001 we entered into a letter of credit reimbursement and security agreement which provides 1215 million for letters of credit in december 2004 we entered into an additional letter of credit reimbursement and security agreement which provides 500 million for letters of credit letters of credit are generally issued for the routine purchase of imported merchandise and we had approximately 978 million of purchases committed under these letters of credit at january 31 2009 

we also have approximately 265 million of letters of credit or surety bonds outstanding for our selfinsurance programs and certain utility payment obligations at some of our stores 

freight contracts we have contracted outbound freight services from various carriers with contracts expiring through february 2013 the total amount of these commitments is approximately 1096 million 

technology assets we have commitments totaling approximately 32 million to primarily purchase store technology assets for our stores during 2009 

derivative financial instruments 

on march 20 2008 we entered into two 750 million interest rate swap agreements these interest rate swaps are used to manage the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations on a portion of our 2500 million variable rate term loan under these agreements we pay interest to financial institutions at a fixed rate of 28 in exchange the financial institutions pay us at a variable rate which approximates the variable rate on the debt excluding the credit spread these swaps qualify for hedge accounting treatment pursuant to sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  these swaps expire in march 2011 

we are party to one additional interest rate swap which allows us to manage the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations on the demand revenue bonds the swap is based on a notional amount of 176 million under the 176 million agreement as amended we pay interest to the bank that provided the swap at a fixed rate in exchange the financial institution pays us at a variableinterest rate which is similar to the rate on the demand revenue bonds the variableinterest rate on the interest rate swap is set monthly no payments are made by either party under the swap for monthly periods with an established interest rate greater than a predetermined rate the knockout rate the swap may be canceled by the bank or us and settled for the fair value of the swap as determined by market rates and expires in 2009 

because of the knockout provision in the 176 million swap changes in the fair value of that swap are recorded in earnings for more information on the interest rate swaps see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk – interest rate risk” beginning on page 29 of this form 10k 

 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates certain of our estimates require a high level of judgment and have the potential to have a material effect on the financial statements if actual results vary significantly   from those estimates following is a discussion of the estimates that we consider critical 

inventory valuation 

as discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements  inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weightedaverage basis cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weightedaverage basis under the retail inventory method the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated costtoretail ratio to the retail value of inventories the retail inventory method is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis 

inventory valuation methods require certain significant management estimates and judgments including estimates of future merchandise markdowns and shrink which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins the averaging required in applying the retail inventory method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns could under certain circumstances result in costs not being recorded in the proper period 

we estimate our markdown reserve based on the consideration of a variety of factors including but not limited to quantities of slow moving or seasonal carryover merchandise on hand historical markdown statistics and future merchandising plans the accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors some of which are outside of our control including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends historically we have not experienced significant differences in our estimated reserve for markdowns compared with actual results 

our accrual for shrink is based on the actual historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories adjusted if necessary for current economic conditions these estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger our physical inventory counts are generally taken between january and september of each year therefore the shrink accrual recorded at january 31 2009 is based on estimated shrink for most of 2008 including the fourth quarter we have not experienced significant fluctuations in historical shrink rates beyond approximately 1020 basis points in our dollar tree stores for the last few years however we have sometimes experienced higher than typical shrink in acquired stores in the year following an acquisition we periodically adjust our shrink estimates to address these factors as they become apparent 

our management believes that our application of the retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market each year on a consistent basis 

accrued expenses 

on a monthly basis we estimate certain expenses in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred our most material estimates include domestic freight expenses selfinsurance programs storelevel operating expenses such as property taxes and utilities and certain other expenses our freight and storelevel operating expenses are estimated based on current activity and historical trends and results our workers compensation and general liability insurance accruals are recorded based on actuarial valuations which are adjusted at least annually based on a review performed by a thirdparty actuary these actuarial valuations are estimates based on our historical loss development factors certain other expenses are estimated and recorded in the periods that management becomes aware of them the related accruals are adjusted as management’s estimates change differences in managements estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual materially different from the calculated accrual our experience has been that some of our estimates are too high and others are too low historically the net total of these differences has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

income taxes 

on a quarterly basis we estimate our required income tax liability and assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets our income taxes payable are estimated based on enacted tax rates including estimated tax rates in states where our store base is growing applied to the income expected to be taxed currently management assesses the recoverability of deferred tax assets based on the availability of carrybacks of future deductible amounts and management’s projections for future taxable income we cannot guarantee that we will generate taxable income in future years historically we have not experienced significant differences in our estimates of our tax accrual 

in addition we have a recorded liability for our estimate of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns judgment is required in evaluating the application of federal and state tax laws including relevant case law and assessing whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination and if so judgment is also required as to the measurement of the amount of tax benefit that will be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or the final outcome differs from the amounts recorded we believe that our liability for uncertain tax positions is adequate for further discussion of our changes in reserves during 2008 see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data  note 3 to the consolidated financial statements” beginning on page 41 of this form 10k 

  

  

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations 

we experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales comparable store net sales operating income and net income and expect this trend to continue our results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors including 

 

our highest sales periods are the christmas and easter seasons easter was observed on april 8 2007 march 23 2008 and will be observed on april 12 2009 we believe that the later easter in 2009 could result in a 250 million increase in sales in the first quarter of 2009 as compared to the first quarter of 2008 we generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and of our operating and net income during the fourth quarter in anticipation of increased sales activity during these months we purchase substantial amounts of inventory and hire a significant number of temporary employees to supplement our continuing store staff our operating results particularly operating and net income could suffer if our net sales were below seasonal norms during the fourth quarter or during the easter season for any reason including merchandise delivery delays due to receiving or distribution problems consumer sentiment or inclement weather 

our unaudited results of operations for the eight most recent quarters are shown in a table in footnote 12 of the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

inflation and other economic factors 

our ability to provide quality merchandise at a fixed price and on a profitable basis may be subject to economic factors and influences that we cannot control consumer spending could decline because of economic pressures including unemployment and rising fuel prices reductions in consumer confidence and spending could have an adverse effect on our sales national or international events including war or terrorism could lead to disruptions in economies in the united states or in foreign countries where we purchase some of our merchandise these and other factors could increase our merchandise costs and other costs that are critical to our operations such as shipping and wage rates 

shipping costs  currently transpacific shipping rates are negotiated with individual freight lines and are subject to fluctuation based on supply and demand for containers and current fuel costs  we can give no assurances as to the final actual rates for 2009 as we are in the early stages of our negotiations 

minimum wage on may 25 2007 legislation was enacted that increased the federal minimum wage from 515 an hour to 725 an hour by july 2009 as a result our wages will increase in 2009 however we believe that we can partially offset the increase in payroll costs through increased store productivity and continued efficiencies in product flow to our stores 

  

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of our business including the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency rate fluctuations we may enter into interest rate swaps to manage exposure to interest rate changes and we may employ other risk management strategies including the use of foreign currency forward contracts we do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging and we do not hold derivative instruments for trading purposes 

interest rate risk 

we use variablerate debt to finance certain of our operations and capital improvements these obligations expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates if interest rates increase interest expense increases conversely if interest rates decrease interest expense also decreases we believe it is beneficial to limit the variability of our interest payments 

to meet this objective we entered into derivative instruments in the form of interest rate swaps to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in the variableinterest rates on a portion of our 2500 million term loan and on our demand revenue bonds the interest rate swaps reduce the interest rate exposure on these variablerate obligations under the interest rate swaps we pay the bank at a fixedrate and receive variableinterest at a rate approximating the variablerate on the obligation thereby creating the economic equivalent of a fixedrate obligation we entered into two 750 million interest rate swap agreements in march 2008 to manage the risk associated with the interest rate fluctuations on a portion of our 2500 million variable rate term loan and we have an additional 176 million interest rate swap to manage the risk associated with the interest rate fluctuations on our demand revenue bonds under this 176 million swap no payments are made by parties under the swap for monthly periods in which the variableinterest rate is greater than the predetermined knockout rate 

the following table summarizes the financial terms of our interest rate swap agreements and the fair value of the interest rate swaps at january 31 2009 

 

hypothetically a 1 change in interest rates results in an approximate 17 million change in the amount paid or received under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement on an annual basis due to many factors management is not able to predict the changes in the fair values of our interest rate swaps these fair values are obtained from our outside financial institutions

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

 

in our opinion dollar tree inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of january 31 2009 based on criteria established in internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

 

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets of dollar tree inc and subsidiaries as of january 31 2009 and february 2 2008 and the related consolidated statements of operations stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the threeyear period ended january 31 2009 and our report dated march 26 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements

 item 1 business 

overview 

since our founding in 1986 we have become the leading operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise at the fixed price of 100 we believe the variety and quality of products we sell for 100 sets us apart from our competitors at february 2 2008 we operated 3411 discount variety retail stores approximately 3300 of these stores sell substantially all items for 100 or less the remaining stores operating as deal which were acquired in march 2006 sell most items for 100 or less but also sell items at prices greater than 100 our stores operate under the names of dollar tree deal and dollar bills on march 2 2008 dollar tree inc became the new parent holding company for dollar tree stores inc which is now an operating subsidiary 

in the past five years we have modified our average store size to reflect what we believe is our optimal store size of between 10000 and 12500 square feet at february 2 2008 approximately 14 of our stores are less than 6000 square feet which is down from approximately 40 of our stores at january 31 2004 these smaller stores are comprised of mall and older strip shopping center locations and are candidates for relocation as their leases expire our current store size reflects our expanded merchandise offerings and improved service to our customers as we have been expanding our merchandise offerings we have added freezers and coolers to approximately 1100 stores during the past three years to increase traffic and transaction size at january 31 2004 we operated 2513 stores in 47 states at february 2 2008 we operated 3411 stores in 48 states our selling square footage increased from approximately 169 million square feet in january 2004 to 284 million square feet in february 2008 our store growth since 2003 has resulted from opening new stores and completing mergers and acquisitions we centrally manage our store and distribution operations from our corporate headquarters in chesapeake virginia 

business strategy 

value merchandise offering  we strive to exceed our customers expectations of the variety and quality of products that they can purchase for 100 by offering items that we believe typically sell for higher prices elsewhere we buy approximately 55 to 60 of our merchandise domestically and import the remaining 40 to 45 our domestic purchases include closeouts we believe our mix of imported and domestic merchandise affords our buyers flexibility that allows them to consistently exceed the customers expectations in addition direct relationships with manufacturers permit us to select from a broad range of products and customize packaging product sizes and package quantities that meet our customers needs 

mix of basic variety and seasonal merchandise we maintain a balanced selection of products within traditional variety store categories we offer a wide selection of everyday basic products and we supplement these basic everyday items with seasonal and closeout merchandise we attempt to keep certain basic consumable merchandise in our stores continuously to establish our stores as a destination and we increased slightly the mix of consumable merchandise in order to increase the traffic in our stores closeout merchandise is purchased opportunistically and represents less than 10 of our purchases national regional and corporate brands have become a bigger part of our merchandise mix 

our merchandise mix consists of 

 

we have added freezers and coolers to certain stores which has increased the consumable merchandise carried by those stores we believe this initiative helps us drive additional transactions and allows us to appeal to a broader demographic mix and these stores will carry more consumable merchandise than stores without freezers we have added freezers and coolers to approximately 360 more stores in 2007 therefore as of february 2 2008 we have freezers and coolers in approximately 1100 of our stores we plan to add them to approximately 150 more stores in 2008 as a result of the installation of freezers and coolers in select stores consumable merchandise has grown as a percentage of purchases and sales and we expect this trend to continue the following table shows the percentage of purchases of each major product group for the years ended february 2 2008 and february 3 2007 

 

customer payment methods all of our stores accept cash checks debit cards and visa credit cards and approximately 1000 stores accept mastercard credit cards  prior to may 2005 approximately 900 of our stores accepted debit cards by the end of 2005 approximately 2300 of our stores accepted debit cards and as of the end of 2006 all of our stores accepted debit cards we began accepting visa credit cards at all of our stores in the fourth quarter of 2007 along with the shift to more consumables the rollout of freezers and coolers and the acceptance of pinbased debit and visa credit transactions we increased the number of stores accepting electronic benefits transfer cards and food stamps at qualified stores in the current year we believe that expanding our tender types has helped increase both the traffic and the average size of transactions at our stores in the current year 

convenient locations and store size we primarily focus on opening new stores in strip shopping centers anchored by mass merchandisers whose target customers we believe to be similar to ours our stores have proven successful in metropolitan areas midsized cities and small towns the range of our store sizes allows us to target a particular location with a store that best suits that market and takes advantage of available real estate opportunities our stores are attractively designed and create an inviting atmosphere for shoppers by using bright lighting vibrant colors decorative signs and background music we enhance the store design with attractive merchandise displays we believe this design attracts new and repeat customers and enhances our image as both a destination and impulse purchase store 

for more information on retail locations and retail store leases see item 2 properties” beginning on page 13 of this form 10k 

profitable stores with strong cash flow we maintain a disciplined costsensitive approach to store site selection in order to minimize the initial capital investment required and maximize our potential to generate high operating margins and strong cash flows we believe that our stores have a relatively small shopping radius which allows us to profitably concentrate multiple stores within a single market our ability to open new stores is dependent upon among other factors locating suitable sites and negotiating favorable lease terms 

our older smaller stores continue to generate significant storelevel operating income and operating cash flows and have some of the highest operating margin rates among our stores however the increased size of our newer stores allows us to offer a wider selection of products including more basic consumable merchandise thereby making them more attractive as a destination store 

the strong cash flows generated by our stores allow us to selffund infrastructure investment and new stores over the past five years cash flows from operating activities have exceeded capital expenditures 

for more information on our results of operations and seasonality of sales see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations beginning on page 19 of this form 10k 

cost control  we believe that substantial buying power at the 100 price point and our flexibility in making sourcing decisions contributes to our successful purchasing strategy which includes disciplined targeted merchandise margin goals by category we believe our disciplined buying and quality merchandise help to minimize markdowns we buy products on an orderbyorder basis and have no material longterm purchase contracts or other assurances of continued product supply or guaranteed product cost no vendor accounted for more than 10 of total merchandise purchased in any of the past five years 

  

  

our supply chain systems continue to provide us with valuable sales information to assist our buyers and improve merchandise allocation to our stores controlling our inventory levels has resulted in more efficient distribution and store operations 

information systems we believe that investments in technology help us to increase sales and control costs our inventory management system has allowed us to improve the efficiency of our supply chain improve merchandise flow and control distribution and store operating costs our automatic replenishment system automatically reorders key items based on actual store level sales and inventory at the end of 2007 we had over 1000 basic everyday items on automatic replenishment 

pointofsale data allows us to track sales by merchandise category at the store level and assists us in planning for future purchases of inventory we believe that this information allows us to ship the appropriate product to stores at the quantities commensurate with selling patterns using this pointofsale data for planning purchases of inventory has helped us maintain our inventory levels on a per store basis in 2007 compared to 2006 despite lower than planned fourth quarter 2007 sales and increased merchandise flow resulting from the earlier easter season in 2008 our inventory turns also increased 25 basis points in 2007 

corporate culture and values we believe that honesty and integrity doing the right things for the right reasons and treating people fairly and with respect are core values within our corporate culture we believe that running a business and certainly a public company carries with it a responsibility to be above reproach when making operational and financial decisions our management team visits and shops our stores like every customer we have an open door policy for all our associates and ideas and individual creativity are encouraged we have standards for store displays merchandise presentation and store operations our distribution centers are operated based on objective measures of performance and virtually everyone in our store support center is available to assist associates in the stores and distribution centers 

our disclosure committee meets at least quarterly and monitors our internal controls over financial reporting and ensures that our public filings contain discussions about the risks our business faces we believe that we have the controls in place to be able to certify our financial statements additionally we have complied with the updated listing requirements for the nasdaq stock market 

growth strategy 

store openings and square footage growth the primary factors contributing to our net sales growth have been new store openings an active store expansion and remodel program and selective mergers and acquisitions from 2003 to 2007 net sales increased at a compound annual growth rate of 109 we expect that the substantial majority of our future sales growth will come primarily from new store openings and from our store expansion and relocation program 

the following table shows the total selling square footage of our stores and the selling square footage per new store opened over the last five years our growth and productivity statistics are reported based on selling square footage because our management believes the use of selling square footage yields a more accurate measure of store productivity the selling square footage statistics for 2003 through 2007 are estimates based on the relationship of selling to gross square footage 

 

we expect to increase our selling square footage in the future by opening new stores in underserved markets and strategically increasing our presence in our existing markets via new store openings and store expansions expansions include store relocations in fiscal 2008 and beyond we plan to predominantly open stores that are approximately 8500  9000 selling square feet and we believe this size allows us to achieve our objectives in the markets in which we plan to expand at february 2 2008 1370 of our stores totaling 556 of our selling square footage were 8500 selling square feet or larger  

in addition to new store openings we plan to continue our store expansion program to increase our net sales per store and take advantage of market opportunities we target stores for expansion based on the current sales per selling square foot and changes in market opportunities stores targeted for expansion are generally less than 6000 selling square feet in size store expansions generally increase the existing store size by approximately 4000 selling square feet 

since 1995 we have added a total of 609 stores through four mergers and several small acquisitions our acquisition strategy has been to target companies with a similar singleprice point concept that have shown success in operations or provide a strategic advantage we evaluate potential acquisition opportunities in our retail sector as they become available 

on march 25 2006 we completed our acquisition of 138 deal stores and paid 320 million for storerelated and other assets and 221 million for inventory these stores are located primarily in the midwest part of the united states and we have existing logistics capacity to service these stores this acquisition also included a few “combo” stores that offer an expanded assortment of merchandise including items that sell for more than 1 substantially all deal stores acquired continue to operate under the deal banner while providing us an opportunity to leverage our dollar tree infrastructure in the testing of new merchandise concepts including higher price points without disrupting the singleprice point model in our dollar tree stores 

in 2007 we also acquired the rights to 32 store leases through bankruptcy proceedings of certain discount retailers we will take advantage of these opportunities as they arise in the future 

merchandising and distribution expanding our customer base is important to our growth plans we plan to continue to stock our new stores with the everchanging merchandise that our current customers have come to appreciate in addition we are opening larger stores that contain more basic consumable merchandise to attract new customers consumable merchandise typically leads to more frequent return trips to our stores resulting in increased sales the presentation and display of merchandise in our stores are critical to communicating value to our customers and creating a more exciting shopping experience we believe our approach to visual merchandising results in higher store traffic higher sales volume and an environment that encourages impulse purchases 

a strong and efficient distribution network is critical to our ability to grow and to maintain a lowcost operating structure we expect to continue to add distribution capacity to support our store opening plans with the aim of remaining approximately one year ahead of our distribution needs in 2007 we added capacity to our briar creek distribution center which services the northeast part of the country we believe these distribution centers including the expanded briar creek pennsylvania distribution center in total are capable of supporting approximately 67 billion in annual sales new distribution sites are strategically located to reduce stem miles maintain flexibility and improve efficiency in our store service areas 

our stores receive approximately 90 of their inventory from our distribution centers via contract carriers the remaining store inventory primarily perishable consumable items and other vendormaintained display items are delivered directly to our stores from vendors for more information on our distribution center network see item 2 “properties” beginning on page 13 of this form 10k 

competition 

the retail industry is highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future the principal methods of competition include closeout merchandise convenience and the quality of merchandise offered to the customer our competitors include singleprice dollar stores multiprice dollar stores mass merchandisers discount retailers and variety retailers in addition several mass merchandisers and grocery store chains carry dollar store or “dollar zone” concepts in their stores which increases competition our sales and profits could be reduced by increases in competition especially because there are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector 

trademarks 

we are the owners of federal service mark registrations for dollar tree the dollar tree logo 1 dollar tree together with the related design and one priceone dollar we also own a concurrent use registration for dollar bill and the related logo during 1997 we acquired the rights to use trade names previously owned by everythings a dollar a former competitor in the 100 price point industry several trade names were included in the purchase including the marks everythings 100 we mean everything and everythings 100 the registration of which is pending with the acquisition of dollar express we became the owner of the service marks dollar express and dollar expres   we became the owners of the greenbacks all a dollar and all a dollar service marks with the acquisition of greenbacks we also became the owners of “deal” and “deal nothing over a dollar” trademarks with the acquisition of deal we have applied for federal trademark registrations for various private labels that we use to market some of our product lines 

employees 

we employed approximately 13300 fulltime and 29300 parttime associates on february 2 2008 parttime associates work 35 hours per week or less the number of parttime associates fluctuates depending on seasonal needs we consider our relationship with our associates to be good and we have not experienced significant interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements none of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements 




 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk you should carefully consider the specific risk factors listed below together with all other information included or incorporated in this report any of the following risks may materialize and additional risks not known to us or that we now deem immaterial may arise in such event our business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected if that occurs the market price of our common stock could fall and you could lose all or part of your investment 

our profitability is especially vulnerable to cost increases 

future increase in costs such as the cost of merchandise wage levels shipping rates freight costs fuel costs and store occupancy costs may reduce our profitability as a fixed price retailer we cannot raise the sales price of our merchandise to offset cost increases unlike multiprice retailers we are primarily dependent on our ability to operate more efficiently or effectively or increase our comparable store net sales in order to offset inflation we can give you no assurance that we will be able to operate more efficiently or increase our comparable store net sales in the future please see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations beginning on page 19 of this form 10k for further discussion of the effect of inflation and other economic factors on our operations 

we could encounter disruptions or additional costs in receiving and distributing merchandise 

our success depends on our ability to transport merchandise from our suppliers to our distribution centers and then ship it to our stores in a timely and costeffective manner we may not anticipate respond to or control all of the challenges of operating our receiving and distribution systems some of the factors that could have an adverse effect on our shipping and receiving systems or costs are 

 

  

  

a downturn in economic conditions could adversely affect our sales 

economic conditions such as those caused by recession inflation cost increases adverse weather conditions or terrorism could reduce consumer spending or cause customers to shift their spending to products we either do not sell or do not sell as profitably adverse economic conditions could disrupt consumer spending and significantly reduce our sales 

sales below our expectations during peak seasons may cause our operating results to suffer materially 

our highest sales periods are the christmas and easter seasons we generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and a substantial majority of our operating and net income during the fourth quarter in anticipation we stock extra inventory and hire many temporary employees to supplement our stores an economic downturn during these periods could adversely affect our operating results particularly operating and net income to a greater extent than if a downturn occurred at other times of the year untimely merchandise delays due to receiving or distribution problems could have a similar effect sales during the easter selling season are materially affected by the timing of the easter holiday easter in fiscal 2007 was on april 8 th  while in fiscal 2008 it will be two weeks earlier on march 23 rd  we believe that the earlier easter in 2008 could potentially result in 250 million of lost sales when compared to the first quarter of 2007 in fiscal 2008 there is one fewer weekend between thanksgiving and christmas compared to fiscal 2007 we believe this could potentially reduce the total foot traffic in our stores for the christmas holiday in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

our sales and profits rely on imported merchandise which may increase in cost or become unavailable 

merchandise imported directly from overseas accounts for approximately 40 to 45 of our total purchases at retail in addition we believe that a small portion of our goods purchased from domestic vendors is imported china is the source of a substantial majority of our imports imported goods are generally less expensive than domestic goods and increase our profit margins a disruption in the flow of our imported merchandise or an increase in the cost of those goods may significantly decrease our profits risks associated with our reliance on imported goods include 

 

we may be unable to expand our square footage as profitably as planned 

we plan to expand our selling square footage by approximately 9 in 2008 to increase our sales and profits expanding our square footage profitably depends on a number of uncertainties including our ability to locate lease build out and open or expand stores in suitable locations on a timely basis under favorable economic terms we must also open or expand stores within our established geographic markets where new or expanded stores may draw sales away from our existing stores we may not manage our expansion effectively and our failure to achieve our expansion plans could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our profitability is affected by the mix of products we sell 

our gross profit could decrease if we increase the proportion of higher cost goods we sell in the future in recent years the percentage of our sales from higher cost consumable products has increased and is likely to increase slightly in 2008 our gross profit will decrease unless we are able to maintain our current merchandise cost sufficiently to offset any decrease in our product margin percentage we can give you no assurance that we will be able to do so 

pressure from competitors may reduce our sales and profits 

the retail industry is highly competitive the marketplace is highly fragmented as many different retailers compete for market share by utilizing a variety of store formats and merchandising strategies we expect competition to increase in the future because there are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector many of our current or potential competitors have greater financial resources than we do we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors please see item 1 “business” beginning on page 6 of this form 10k for further discussion of the effect of competition on our operations 

the resolution of certain legal matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations accrued liabilities and cash 

for a discussion of current legal matters please see item 3 “legal proceedings” beginning on page 14 of this form 10k resolution of certain matters described in that item if decided against the company could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations accrued liabilities or cash flows 

certain provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws could delay or discourage a takeover attempt that may be in a shareholders best interest 

our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may delay or discourage a takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider in his best interest these provisions among other things 

 

however we believe that these provisions allow our board of directors to negotiate a higher price in the event of a takeover attempt which would be in the best interest of our shareholders

 item 2 properties 

stores 

as of february 2 2008 we operated 3411 stores in 48 states as detailed below 

 

 

we currently lease our stores and expect to continue to lease new stores as we expand our leases typically provide for a short initial lease term generally five years with options to extend however in some cases we have initial lease terms of seven to ten years we believe this leasing strategy enhances our flexibility to pursue various expansion opportunities resulting from changing market conditions as current leases expire we believe that we will be able to obtain lease renewals if desired for present store locations or to obtain leases for equivalent or better locations in the same general area 

distribution centers 

the following table includes information about the distribution centers that we currently operate we expanded the briar creek distribution center in 2007 we believe our distribution center network including this expansion is capable of supporting approximately 67 billion in annual sales 

 

in addition to our distribution centers noted above during the past several years we have used offsite facilities to accommodate limited quantities of seasonal merchandise 

each of our distribution centers contains advanced materials handling technologies including radiofrequency inventory tracking equipment and specialized information systems with the exception of our salt lake city and ridgefield facilities each of our distribution centers also contains automated conveyor and sorting systems 

for more information on financing of our distribution centers see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations funding requirements beginning on page 25 of this form 10k 

  

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

from time to time we are defendants in ordinary routine litigation or proceedings incidental to our business including allegations regarding 

 

 

in 2003 we were served with a lawsuit in a california state court by a former employee who alleged that employees did not properly receive sufficient meal breaks and paid rest periods along with other alleged wage and hour violations the suit requested that the court certify the case as a class action the parties engaged in mediation and reached an agreement which upon presentation to the court received preliminary approval and the certification of a settlement class notices have been mailed to the class members and the final fairness hearing is expected to occur on may 22 2008 the settlement amount has been accrued in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of february 2 2008 

 

in 2005 we were served with a lawsuit by former employees in oregon who allege that they did not properly receive sufficient meal breaks and paid rest periods and that terminated employees were not paid in a timely manner the plaintiffs requested the court to certify classes for their various claims and the presiding judge did so with respect to two classes but denied others after a partly successful appeal by the plaintiffs one additional class has been certified the certified classes now include two for alleged violations of that state’s labor laws concerning rest breaks and one related to untimely payments upon termination discovery is now ongoing and no trial is anticipated before the latter part of 2008 

 

in 2006 we were served with a lawsuit by a former employee in a california state court alleging that she was paid for wages with a check drawn on a bank which did not have any branches in the state an alleged violation of the states labor code that she was paid less for her work than other similar employees with the same job title based on her gender and that she was not paid her final wages in a timely manner also an alleged violation of the labor code the plaintiff requested the court to certify the case and those claims as a class action the parties have reached a settlement and executed an agreement by which the named plaintiff individually settled her equal pay act and late payment claims the court accepted the proposed settlement and certified a class for the check claim notices have been mailed to class members and a hearing for final approval of the settlement has been scheduled for april 22 2008 the estimated settlement amount has been accrued in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of february 2 2008 

 

in 2006 we were served with a lawsuit filed in federal court in the state of alabama by a former store manager she claims that she should have been classified as a nonexempt employee under the fair labor standards act and therefore should have received overtime compensation and other benefits she filed the case as a collective action on behalf of herself and all other employees store managers similarly situated plaintiff sought and received from the court an order allowing nationwide except for the state of california notice to be sent to all store managers employed by the company now or within the past three years such notice has been mailed and each involved person will determine whether he or she wishes to optin to the class as a plaintiff we intend at the appropriate time to challenge the anticipated effort by the optin plaintiffs to be certified as a class 

 

in 2007 we were served with a lawsuit filed in federal court in the state of california by one present and one former store manager they claim they should have been classified as nonexempt employees under both the california labor code and the fair labor standards act they filed the case as a class action on behalf of california based store managers we responded with a motion to dismiss which the court granted with respect to allegations of fraud the plaintiff then filed an amended complaint which has been answered by us we were thereafter served with a second suit in a california state court which alleges essentially the same claims as those contained in the federal action and which likewise seeks class certification of all california store managers we have removed the case to the same federal court as the first suit answered it and the two cases have been consolidated we will defend plaintiffs’ anticipated effort to seek class certification 

 

in 2007 we were served with a lawsuit filed in federal court in california by two former employees who allege they were not paid all wages due and owing for time worked that they were not paid in a timely manner upon termination of their employment and that they did not receive accurate itemized wage statements they filed the suit as a class action and seek to include in the class all of our former employees in the state of california we responded with a motion to dismiss which the court denied we answered and a motion for summary judgment on our part is presently pending before the court 

 

we were recently served in federal court in california with a complaint on behalf of a former employee alleging meal and rest break violations among other causes of action and seeking class action status the settlement order entered by the court in the 2003 case referenced above included an injunction against meal and rest break claims on the part of class members which we believe include this plaintiff we will seek to stay this litigation in accordance with that injunction 

 

we will vigorously defend ourselves in these lawsuits we do not believe that any of these matters will individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition we cannot give assurance however that one or more of these lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the period in which they are resolved

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

in management’s discussion and analysis we explain the general financial condition and the results of operations for our company including 

 

as you read management’s discussion and analysis please refer to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10k which present the results of operations for the fiscal years ended february 2 2008 february 3 2007 and january 28 2006 in management’s discussion and analysis we analyze and explain the annual changes in some specific line items in the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year 2007 compared to the comparable fiscal year 2006 and the fiscal year 2006 compared to the comparable fiscal year 2005 

key events and recent developments 

several key events have had or are expected to have a significant effect on our operations you should keep in mind that 

 

overview 

our net sales are derived from the sale of merchandise two major factors tend to affect our net sales trends first is our success at opening new stores or adding new stores through acquisitions second sales vary at our existing stores from one year to the next we refer to this change as a change in comparable store net sales because we compare only those stores that are open throughout both of the periods being compared we include sales from stores expanded during the year in the calculation of comparable store net sales which has the effect of increasing our comparable store net sales the term expanded also includes stores that are relocated 

at february 2 2008 we operated 3411 stores in 48 states with 284 million selling square feet compared to 3219 stores with 263 million selling square feet at february 3 2007 during fiscal 2007 we opened 240 stores expanded 102 stores and closed 48 stores compared to 211 new stores opened 85 stores expanded and 44 stores closed during fiscal 2006 in addition to the new stores opened in 2006 we acquired 138 deal stores on march 25 2006 in the current year we achieved 8 selling square footage growth of the 21 million selling square foot increase in 2007 04 million was added by expanding existing stores the average size of our stores opened in 2007 was approximately 8500 selling square feet or about 10800 gross square feet the average new store size decreased slightly in 2007 from approximately 9000 selling square feet or about 11000 gross square feet for new stores in 2006 for 2008 we continue to plan to open stores that are approximately 8500  9000 selling square feet or about 10000  12500 gross square feet we believe that this store size is our optimal size operationally and that this size also gives our customers an improved shopping environment that invites them to shop longer and buy more we expect the substantial majority of our future net sales growth to come from the square footage growth resulting from new store openings and expansion of existing stores 

fiscal 2006 ended on february 3 2007 and included 53 weeks commensurate with the retail calendar the 53 rd week in 2006 added approximately 70 million in sales fiscal 2007 and 2005 ended on february 2 2008 and january 28 2006 respectively and both years included 52 weeks 

in fiscal 2007 comparable store net sales increased by 27 this increase was based on the comparable 52 weeks for both years we believe comparable store net sales were positively affected by a number of our initiatives over the past year including expansion of forms of payment accepted by our stores and the rollout of freezers and coolers to more of our stores during 2006 we completed the rollout of pincapture debit card acceptance to all of our stores which has enabled us to accept electronic benefit transfer cards and we now accept food stamps in approximately 1100 qualified stores we believe the expansion of forms of payment accepted by our stores has helped increase the average transaction size in our stores on october 31 2007 all of our stores began accepting visa credit as well which we expect to have a positive impact on future sales 

we continued to experience a slight shift in the mix of merchandise sold to more consumables which we believe increases the traffic in our stores however this merchandise has lower margins the negative impact from the planned shift toward more consumables was smaller in 2007 than in 2006 the planned shift in mix to more consumables is partially the result of the rollout of frozen and refrigerated merchandise to more stores in 2007 and 2006 at february 2 2008 we had frozen and refrigerated merchandise in approximately 1100 stores compared to approximately 700 stores at february 3 2007 we believe that this will continue to enable us to increase sales and earnings by increasing the number of shopping trips made by our customers and increasing the average transaction size 

our pointofsale technology provides us with valuable sales and inventory information to assist our buyers and improve our merchandise allocation to our stores we believe that this has enabled us to better manage our inventory flow resulting in more efficient distribution and store operations and increased inventory turnover for each of the last two years inventory turnover improved by approximately 25 basis points in 2007 compared to 2006 and by approximately 45 basis points in 2006 compared to 2005 inventory per store has also remained constant at february 2 2008 compared to february 3 2007 despite slightly lower than expected fourthquarter 2007 sales and the increased merchandise flow due to the earlier easter season in 2008 

we must continue to control our merchandise costs inventory levels and our general and administrative expenses increases in these line items could negatively impact our operating results 

our plans for fiscal 2008 anticipate net sales in the 449 billion to 462 billion range and diluted earnings per share of 217 to 235 this guidance for 2008 is predicated on selling square footage growth of approximately 9 the earnings per share guidance for 2008 is exclusive of any share repurchase activity in 2008 

on march 25 2006 we completed our acquisition of 138 deal stores these stores are located primarily in the midwest part of the united states and we have existing logistics capacity to service these stores this acquisition also included a few “combo” stores that offer an expanded assortment of merchandise including items that sell for more than 1 substantially all deal stores acquired continue to operate under the deal banner while providing us an opportunity to leverage our dollar tree infrastructure in the testing of new merchandise concepts including higher price points without disrupting the singleprice point model in our dollar tree stores at february 2 2008 131 of these stores were selling items priced over 100 compared to 121 stores at february 3 2007 

we paid approximately 320 million for storerelated and other assets and 221 million for inventory the results of deal store operations are included in our financial statements since the acquisition date and did not have a significant impact on our operating results in fiscal 2007 or fiscal 2006 

results of operations 

the following table expresses items from our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales 

 

 

fiscal year ended february 2 2008 compared to fiscal year ended february 3 2007 

net sales  net sales increased 69 or 2732 million in 2007 compared to 2006 resulting primarily from sales in our new and expanded stores our sales increase was also impacted by a 27 increase in comparable store net sales for the year this increase is based on the comparable 52weeks for both years these increases were partially offset by an extra week of sales in 2006 due to the 53week retail calendar for 2006 on a comparative 52week basis sales increased approximately 88 in 2007 compared to 2006 comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores which we include in the calculation and to a lesser extent are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing ones 

  

  

the following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store count for fiscal years ended february 2 2008 and february 3 2007 

 

of the 21 million selling square foot increase in 2007 approximately 04 million was added by expanding existing stores 

gross profit  gross profit margin increased to 344 in 2007 compared to 342 in 2006 the increase was primarily due to a 50 basis point decrease in merchandise cost including inbound freight due to improved initial markup in many categories in the current year this decrease was partially offset by a 40 basis point increase in occupancy costs due to the loss of leverage from the extra week of sales in the prior year and the lower comparable store net sales in the current year 

selling general and administrative expenses  selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 266 for 2007 compared to 264 for 2006 the increase is primarily due to the following 

 

operating income  due to the reasons discussed above operating income margin was 78 in 2007 and 2006 

income taxes  our effective tax rate was 371 in 2007 compared to 366 in 2006 the increase in the rate for 2007 reflects a reduction of taxexempt interest income in the current year due to lower investment levels resulting from increased share repurchase activity and an increase in tax reserves in accordance with the financial accounting standards board’s financial interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  these increases more than offset a slight decrease in our net state tax rate 

fiscal year ended february 3 2007 compared to fiscal year ended january 28 2006 

net sales  net sales increased 169 or 5755 million in 2006 compared to 2005 resulting from sales in our new and expanded stores including 138 deal stores acquired in march 2006 and the 53 weeks of sales in 2006 versus 52 weeks in 2005 which accounted for approximately 70 million of the increase our sales increase was also impacted by a 46 increase in comparable store net sales for the year this increase is based on a 53week comparison for both periods comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores which we include in the calculation and to a lesser extent are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing ones 

the following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store count for fiscal years ended february 3 2007 and january 28 2006 

 

of the 33 million selling square foot increase in 2006 approximately 12 million resulted from the acquisition of the deal stores and 04 million was added by expanding existing stores 

gross profit  gross profit margin decreased to 342 in 2006 compared to 345 in 2005 the decrease was primarily due to a 35 basis point increase in merchandise cost including inbound freight this increase in merchandise cost was due to a slight shift in mix to more consumables which have a lower margin higher cost merchandise at our deal stores and increased inbound domestic freight costs 

selling general and administrative expenses  selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 264 for 2006 as compared to 262 for 2005 the increase is primarily due to the following 

 

operating income  due to the reasons discussed above operating income margin decreased to 78 in 2006 compared to 83 in 2005 

income taxes  our effective tax rate was 366 in 2006 compared to 368 in 2005 the decreased tax rate for 2006 was due primarily to increased taxexempt interest on certain of our investments in 2006 

liquidity and capital resources 

our business requires capital to build and open new stores expand our distribution network and operate existing stores our working capital requirements for existing stores are seasonal and usually reach their peak in september and october historically we have satisfied our seasonal working capital requirements for existing stores and have funded our store opening and distribution network expansion programs from internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities 

the following table compares cashrelated information for the years ended february 2 2008 february 3 2007 and january 28 2006 

 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased 455 million compared to last year due to increased working capital requirements in the current year and increases in the provision for deferred taxes partially offset by improved earnings before depreciation and amortization in the current year 

net cash used in investing activities decreased 1680 million compared to last year this decrease is due to 1291 million of increased proceeds from shortterm investment activity in the current year to fund increased capital stock repurchases and 541 million used in the prior year to acquire deal assets these were partially offset by increased capital expenditures in the current year resulting from the briar creek distribution center and the corporate headquarters expansions 

net cash used in financing activities increased 1861 million due primarily to increased stock repurchases in the current year partially offset by increased proceeds from stock option exercises in the current year resulting from the company’s higher stock price earlier in the year 

the 477 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily due to increased earnings before depreciation and better payables management in 2006 partially offset by approximately 289 million of rent payments for february 2007 made prior to the end of fiscal 2006 

the 448 million decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2006 compared to 2005 was the result of a 1149 million increase in net proceeds from shortterm investments which were used to help fund stock repurchases and the deal acquisition in 2006 in 2006 we purchased an additional 93 million net of investments in a restricted account to collateralize certain longterm insurance obligations additional uses of cash for investing activities consisted of 541 million for the deal acquisition in 2006 and an increase of 361 million in capital expenditures due primarily to new store growth and the installation of freezers and coolers to certain stores in 2006 

the 326 million increase in cash used in financing activities in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily resulted from 2482 million in stock repurchases in 2006 compared to 1804 million in 2005 this increase was partially offset by increased proceeds from stock option exercises in 2006 resulting from our higher stock prices in 2006 as compared to 2005 

at february 2 2008 our longterm borrowings were 2685 million and our capital lease commitments were 09 million we also have 1250 million and 500 million letter of credit reimbursement and security agreements under which approximately 889 million were committed to letters of credit issued for routine purchases of imported merchandise at february 2 2008 

on february 20 2008 we entered into a fiveyear 5500 million credit agreement the agreement the agreement provides for a 3000 million revolving line of credit including up to 1500 million in available letters of credit and a 2500 million term loan our march 2004 4500 million unsecured revolving credit facility was terminated concurrent with entering into the agreement 

in march 2005 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 3000 million of our common stock through march 2008 in november 2006 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 5000 million of our common stock this amount was in addition to the 270 million remaining on the march 2005 authorization then in october 2007 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 5000 million of our common stock this authorization was in addition to the november 2006 authorization which had approximately 984 million remaining at the time 

in december 2006 we entered into two agreements with a third party to repurchase approximately 1000 million of our common shares under an accelerated share repurchase agreement 

the first 500 million was executed in an “uncollared” agreement in this transaction we initially received 17 million shares based on the market price of our stock of 3019 as of the trade date december 8 2006 a weighted average price of 3217 was calculated using stock prices from december 16 2006 – march 8 2007 this represented the calculation period for the weighted average price   based on this weighted average price we paid the third party an additional 33 million on march 8 2007 for the 17 million shares delivered under this agreement 

the remaining 500 million was executed under a “collared” agreement under this agreement we initially received 15 million shares through december 15 2006 representing the minimum number of shares to be received based on a calculation using the “cap” or highend of the price range of the collar the number of shares received under the agreement was determined based on the weighted average market price of our common stock net of a predetermined discount during the time after the initial execution date through march 8 2007 the calculated weighted average market price through march 8 2007 net of a predetermined discount as defined in the “collared” agreement was 3197 therefore on march 8 2007 we received an additional 01 million shares under the “collared” agreement resulting in 16 million total shares being repurchased under this agreement 

on march 29 2007 we entered into an agreement with a third party to repurchase 1500 million of our common shares under an accelerated share repurchase agreement the entire 1500 million was executed under a “collared” agreement under this agreement we initially received 36 million shares through april 12 2007 representing the minimum number of shares to be received based on a calculation using the “cap” or highend of the price range of the collar the number of shares was determined based on the weighted average market price of our common stock during the four months after the initial execution date the calculated weighted average market price through july 30 2007 net of a predetermined discount as defined in the “collared” agreement was 4078 therefore on july 30 2007 we received an additional 01 million shares under the “collared” agreement resulting in 37 million total shares being repurchased under this agreement 

on august 30 2007 we entered into an agreement with a third party to repurchase 1000 million of our common shares under an accelerated share repurchase agreement the entire 1000 million was executed under a “collared” agreement under this agreement we initially received 21 million shares through september 10 2007 representing the minimum number of shares to be received based on a calculation using the “cap” or highend of the price range of the collar the number of shares received under the agreement was determined based on the weighted average market price of our common stock net of a predetermined discount during the time after the initial execution date through a period of up to four and one half months the contract terminated on october 22 2007 and the weighted average price through that date was 4116 therefore on october 22 2007 we received an additional 03 million shares resulting in 24 million total shares repurchased under this agreement 

we repurchased approximately 128 million shares for approximately 4730 million in fiscal 2007 approximately 88 million shares for approximately 2482 million in fiscal 2006 and approximately 70 million shares for approximately 1804 million in fiscal 2005 at february 2 2008 the company had approximately 4537 remaining under board authorization 

funding requirements 

overview 

we expect our cash needs for opening new stores and expanding existing stores in fiscal 2008 to total approximately 1760   million which includes capital expenditures initial inventory and preopening costs our estimated capital expenditures for fiscal 2008 are between 1550 and 1650 million including planned expenditures for our new and expanded stores the addition of freezers and coolers to approximately 150 stores and completion of the expansion to our home office and data center in chesapeake va we believe that we can adequately fund our working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures for the next few years from net cash provided by operations and potential borrowings under our existing credit facility 

the following tables summarize our material contractual obligations at february 2 2008 including both on and offbalance sheet arrangements and our commitments excluding interest on longterm borrowings in millions 

 

 

lease financing 

operating lease obligations our operating lease obligations are primarily for payments under noncancelable store leases the commitment includes amounts for leases that were signed prior to february 2 2008 for stores that were not yet open on february 2 2008 

capital lease obligations  our capital lease obligations are primarily for distribution center equipment and computer equipment at the store support center 

revolving credit facility in march 2004 we entered into a fiveyear revolving credit facility the facility the facility provides for a 4500 million line of credit including up to 500 million in available letters of credit interest is assessed under the line based on matrix pricing which currently approximates libor plus 0475 this rate was 447 at february 2 2008 the facility also bears a facilities fee calculated as a percentage as defined of the amount available under the facility payable quarterly the facility among other things requires the maintenance of certain specified financial ratios restricts the payment of certain distributions and prohibits the incurrence of certain new indebtedness the facility also bears an administrative fee payable annually we used availability under this facility to repay the 1426 million of variablerate debt and to purchase shortterm investments as of february 2 2008 we had 2500 million outstanding on this facility 

on february 20 2008 we entered into a fiveyear 5500 million credit agreement the agreement the agreement provides for a 3000 million revolving line of credit including up to 1500 million in available letters of credit and a 2500 million term loan the interest rate on the facility will be based at our option on a libor rate plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin the revolving line of credit also bears a facilities fee calculated as a percentage as defined of the amount available under the line of credit payable quarterly the term loan is due and payable in full at the five year maturity date of the agreement the agreement also bears an administrative fee payable annually the agreement among other things requires the maintenance of certain specified financial ratios restricts the payment of certain distributions and prohibits the incurrence of certain new indebtedness our march 2004 4500 million unsecured revolving credit facility was terminated concurrent with entering into the agreement 

revenue bond financing  in may 1998 we entered into an agreement with the mississippi business finance corporation under which it issued 190 million of variablerate demand revenue bonds we used the proceeds from the bonds to finance the acquisition construction and installation of land buildings machinery and equipment for our distribution facility in olive branch mississippi at february 2 2008 the balance outstanding on the bonds was 185 million these bonds are due to be fully repaid in june 2018 the bonds do not have a prepayment penalty as long as the interest rate remains variable the bonds contain a demand provision and therefore outstanding amounts are classified as current liabilities we pay interest monthly based on a variable interest rate which was 338 at february 2 2008 

interest on longterm borrowings this amount represents interest payments on the revolving credit facility and the revenue bond financing using the interest rates for each at february 2 2008 

commitments 

letters of credit and surety bonds  in march 2001 we entered into a letter of credit reimbursement and security agreement which provides 1250 million for letters of credit in december 2004 we entered into an additional letter of credit reimbursement and security agreement which provides 500 million for letters of credit letters of credit are generally issued for the routine purchase of imported merchandise and we had approximately 889 million of purchases committed under these letters of credit at february 2 2008 

we also have approximately 198 million of letters of credit or surety bonds outstanding for our selfinsurance programs and certain utility payment obligations at some of our stores 

freight contracts we have contracted outbound freight services from various carriers with contracts expiring through february 2013 the total amount of these commitments is approximately 1912 million 

technology assets we have commitments totaling approximately 51 million to primarily purchase store technology assets for our stores during 2008 

 

derivative financial instruments 

we are party to one interest rate swap which allows us to manage the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations on the demand revenue bonds the swap is based on a notional amount of 185 million under the 185 million agreement as amended we pay interest to the bank that provided the swap at a fixed rate in exchange the financial institution pays us at a variableinterest rate which is similar to the rate on the demand revenue bonds the variableinterest rate on the interest rate swap is set monthly no payments are made by either party under the swap for monthly periods with an established interest rate greater than a predetermined rate the knockout rate the swap may be canceled by the bank or us and settled for the fair value of the swap as determined by market rates and expires in 2009 

because of the knockout provision in the 185 million swap changes in the fair value of that swap are recorded in earnings for more information on the interest rate swaps see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk – interest rate risk” beginning on page 29 of this form 10k 

on march 20 2008 we entered into two 750 million interest rate swap agreements these interest rate swaps are used to manage the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations on a portion of our 2500 million variable rate term note under these agreements we pay interest to financial institutions at a fixed rate of 28 in exchange the financial institutions pay us at a variable rate which approximates the variable rate on the debt excluding the credit spread we believe these swaps are highly effective as the interest reset dates and the underlying interest rate indices are identical for the swaps and the debt these swaps qualify for hedge accounting treatment pursuant to sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  these swaps expire in march 2011 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates certain of our estimates require a high level of judgment and have the potential to have a material effect on the financial statements if actual results vary significantly   from those estimates following is a discussion of the estimates that we consider critical 

inventory valuation 

as discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weightedaverage basis cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weightedaverage basis under the retail inventory method the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated costtoretail ratio to the retail value of inventories the retail inventory method is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis 

inventory valuation methods require certain significant management estimates and judgments including estimates of future merchandise markdowns and shrink which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins the averaging required in applying the retail inventory method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns could under certain circumstances result in costs not being recorded in the proper period 

we estimate our markdown reserve based on the consideration of a variety of factors including but not limited to quantities of slow moving or seasonal carryover merchandise on hand historical markdown statistics and future merchandising plans the accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors some of which are outside of our control including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends historically we have not experienced significant differences in our estimated reserve for markdowns compared with actual results 

our accrual for shrink is based on the actual historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories adjusted if necessary for current economic conditions these estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger our physical inventory counts are generally taken between january and september of each year therefore the shrink accrual recorded at february 2 2008 is based on estimated shrink for most of 2007 including the fourth quarter we have not experienced significant fluctuations in historical shrink rates beyond approximately 10 basis points in our dollar tree stores for the last two years however we have sometimes experienced higher than typical shrink in acquired stores in the year following an acquisition we periodically adjust our shrink estimates to address these factors as they become apparent 

our management believes that our application of the retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market each year on a consistent basis 

accrued expenses 

on a monthly basis we estimate certain expenses in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred our most material estimates include domestic freight expenses selfinsurance programs storelevel operating expenses such as property taxes and utilities and certain other expenses our freight and storelevel operating expenses are estimated based on current activity and historical trends and results our workers compensation and general liability insurance accruals are recorded based on actuarial valuations which are adjusted annually based on a review performed by a thirdparty actuary these actuarial valuations are estimates based on historical loss development factors certain other expenses are estimated and recorded in the periods that management becomes aware of them the related accruals are adjusted as management’s estimates change differences in managements estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual materially different from the calculated accrual our experience has been that some of our estimates are too high and others are too low historically the net total of these differences has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

income taxes 

on a quarterly basis we estimate our required income tax liability and assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets our income taxes payable are estimated based on enacted tax rates including estimated tax rates in states where our store base is growing applied to the income expected to be taxed currently management assesses the recoverability of deferred tax assets based on the availability of carrybacks of future deductible amounts and management’s projections for future taxable income we cannot guarantee that we will generate taxable income in future years historically we have not experienced significant differences in our estimates of our tax accrual 

in addition we have a recorded liability for our estimate of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return judgment is required in evaluating the application of federal and state tax laws including relevant case law and assessing whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination and if so judgment is also required as to the measurement of the amount of tax benefit that will be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or the final outcome differs from the amounts recorded we believe that our liability for uncertain tax positions is adequate for further discussion of our changes in reserves during 2007 see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data  note 3 to the consolidated financial statements” beginning on page 42 of this form 10k 

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations 

we experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales comparable store net sales operating income and net income and expect this trend to continue our results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors including 

 

our highest sales periods are the christmas and easter seasons easter was observed on april 16 2006 april 8 2007 and will be observed on march 23 2008 we believe that the earlier easter in 2008 could potentially result in 25 million of lost sales when compared to the first quarter of 2007 we generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and of our operating and net income during the fourth quarter in anticipation of increased sales activity during these months we purchase substantial amounts of inventory and hire a significant number of temporary employees to supplement our continuing store staff our operating results particularly operating and net income could suffer if our net sales were below seasonal norms during the fourth quarter or during the easter season for any reason including merchandise delivery delays due to receiving or distribution problems consumer sentiment or inclement weather fiscal 2006 consisted of 53 weeks commensurate with the retail calendar this extra week contributed approximately 70 million of sales in 2006 compared to 2007 fiscal 2007 consisted of 52 weeks in fiscal 2008 there is one fewer weekend between thanksgiving and christmas compared to fiscal 2007 we believe this could potentially reduce the total foot traffic in our stores for the christmas holiday in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

our unaudited results of operations for the eight most recent quarters are shown in a table in footnote 12 of the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

inflation and other economic factors 

our ability to provide quality merchandise at a fixed price and on a profitable basis may be subject to economic factors and influences that we cannot control consumer spending could decline because of economic pressures including rising fuel prices reductions in consumer confidence and spending could have an adverse effect on our sales national or international events including war or terrorism could lead to disruptions in economies in the united states or in foreign countries where we purchase some of our merchandise these and other factors could increase our merchandise costs and other costs that are critical to our operations such as shipping and wage rates 

shipping costs  currently transpacific shipping rates are negotiated with individual freight lines and are subject to fluctuation based on supply and demand for containers and current fuel costs as a result our transpacific shipping costs in fiscal 2008 may increase compared with fiscal 2007 when we renegotiate our import shipping rates effective may 2008 we can give no assurances as to the amount of the increase as we are in the early stages of our negotiations 

minimum wage on may 25 2007 the president signed legislation that increased the federal minimum wage from 515 an hour to 725 an hour by june 2009 we do not expect this legislation to have a material effect on our operations in fiscal 2008 

new accounting pronouncements 

in september 2006 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 157 fair value measurement sfas no 157 sfas no 157 effective for interim or annual reporting periods beginning after november 15 2007 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements we will adopt this statement in the first quarter of 2008 and we do not expect it to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

in july 2006 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 fin 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 109  fin 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 109 accounting for income taxes  fin 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return fin 48 also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosures and transition we adopted fin 48 in the first quarter of 2007 for further discussion of the effect of the adoption of fin 48 see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”  notes 1 and 3 of the consolidated financial statements beginning on page 37 of this form 10k 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of our business including the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency rate fluctuations we may enter into interest rate swaps to manage exposure to interest rate changes and we may employ other risk management strategies including the use of foreign currency forward contracts we do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging purposes and we do not hold derivative instruments for trading purposes 

  

  

interest rate risk 

we use variablerate debt to finance certain of our operations and capital improvements these obligations expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates if interest rates increase interest expense increases conversely if interest rates decrease interest expense also decreases we believe it is beneficial to limit the variability of our interest payments 

to meet this objective we entered into a derivative instrument in the form of an interest rate swap to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in the variableinterest rates on the demand revenue bonds the interest rate swap reduces the interest rate exposure on this variablerate obligation under the interest rate swap we pay the bank at a fixedrate and receive variableinterest at a rate approximating the variablerate on the obligation thereby creating the economic equivalent of a fixedrate obligation under the swap no payments are made by parties under the swap for monthly periods in which the variableinterest rate is greater than the predetermined knockout rate 

the following table summarizes the financial terms of our interest rate swap agreement and the fair value of the interest rate swap at february 2 2008 

 

hypothetically a 1 change in interest rates results in approximately a 02 million change in the amount paid or received under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement on an annual basis due to many factors management is not able to predict the changes in fair value of our interest rate swap these fair values are obtained from an outside financial institution 

on march 20 2008 we entered into two 750 million interest rate swap agreements these interest rate swaps are used to manage the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations on a portion of our 2500 million variable rate term note under these agreements we pay interest to financial institutions at a fixed rate of 28 in exchange the financial institutions pay us at a variable rate which approximates the variable rate on the debt excluding the credit spread we believe these swaps are highly effective as the interest reset dates and the underlying interest rate indices are identical for the swaps and the debt these swaps qualify for hedge accounting treatment pursuant to sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and expire in march 2011

 item 1 business 

overview 

since our founding in 1986 we have become the leading operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise at the fixed price of 100 we believe the variety and quality of products we sell for 100 sets us apart from our competitors at february 3 2007 we operated 3219 discount variety retail stores approximately 3100 of these stores sell substantially all items for 100 or less the remaining stores operating as deal which were acquired in march 2006 sell many items for 100 or less but also sell items at prices greater than 100 our stores operate under the names of dollar tree deal dollar bills and dollar express 

in the past five years we have modified our average store size to reflect what we believe is our optimal store size of between 10000 and 12500 square feet at february 3 2007 approximately 17 of our stores are less than 6000 square feet which is down from approximately 47 of our stores at december 31 2002 these smaller stores are comprised of mall and older strip shopping center locations and are candidates for relocation as their leases expire our current store size reflects our expanded merchandise offerings and improved service to our customers as we have been expanding our merchandise offerings we have added freezers and coolers to approximately 700 stores during the past two years to increase traffic and transaction size at december 31 2002 we operated 2263 stores in 40 states at february 3 2007 we operated 3219 stores in 48 states our selling square footage increased from approximately 130 million square feet in december 2002 to 263 million square feet in february 2007 our store growth since 2002 has resulted from opening new stores and completing mergers and acquisitions we centrally manage our store and distribution operations from our corporate headquarters in chesapeake virginia 

business strategy 

value merchandise offering  we strive to exceed our customers expectations of the variety and quality of products that they can purchase for 100 by offering items that we believe typically sell for higher prices elsewhere we buy approximately 60 to 65 of our merchandise domestically and import the remaining 35 to 40 our domestic purchases include closeouts we believe our mix of imported and domestic merchandise affords our buyers flexibility that allows them to consistently exceed the customers expectation in addition direct relationships with manufacturers permit us to select from a broad range of products and customize packaging product sizes and package quantities that meet our customers needs 

mix of basic variety and seasonal merchandise we maintain a balanced selection of products within traditional variety store categories we offer a wide selection of everyday basic products and we supplement these basic everyday items with seasonal and closeout merchandise we attempt to keep certain basic consumable merchandise in our stores continuously to establish our stores as a destination and increased slightly the mix of consumable merchandise in order to increase the traffic in our stores closeout merchandise is purchased opportunistically and represents less than 10 of our purchases national regional and privatelabel brands have become a bigger part of our merchandise mix 

our merchandise mix consists of 

 

we have added freezers and coolers to certain stores which have increased the consumable merchandise carried by our stores we believe this initiative helps us drive additional transactions and allows us to appeal to a broader demographic mix and these stores will carry more consumable merchandise than stores without freezers we have added freezers and coolers to approximately 400 more stores in 2006 therefore as of february 3 2007 we have freezers and coolers in approximately 700 of our stores we plan to add them to approximately 250 more stores in 2007 as a result of the installation of freezers and coolers in select stores consumable merchandise has grown as a percentage of purchases and sales and we expect this trend to continue the following table shows the percentage of purchases of each major product group for the years ended february 3 2007 and january 28 2006 

 

customer payment methods all of our stores accept cash and checks and approximately 700 stores accept visa and mastercard credit cards  prior to may 2005 approximately 900 of our stores accepted debit cards by the end of 2005 approximately 2300 of our stores accepted debit cards and as of the end of 2006 all of our stores accept debit cards along with the shift to more consumables the rollout of freezers and coolers and the acceptance of pinbased debit transactions we increased the number of stores accepting electronic benefits transfer cards and food stamps at qualified stores in the current year we believe that expanding our tender types has helped increase both the traffic and the average size of transactions at our stores in the current year 

convenient locations and store size we primarily focus on opening new stores in strip shopping centers anchored by mass merchandisers whose target customers we believe to be similar to ours and in neighborhood centers anchored by large grocery retailers our stores have proven successful in metropolitan areas midsized cities and small towns the range of our store sizes allows us to target a particular location with a store that best suits that market and takes advantage of available real estate opportunities our stores are attractively designed and create an inviting atmosphere for shoppers by using bright lighting vibrant colors decorative signs and background music we enhance the store design with attractive merchandise displays we believe this design attracts new and repeat customers and enhances our image as both a destination and impulse purchase store 

for more information on retail locations and retail store leases see properties 

profitable stores with strong cash flow we maintain a disciplined costsensitive approach to store site selection in order to minimize the initial capital investment required and maximize our potential to generate high operating margins and strong cash flows we believe that our stores have a relatively small shopping radius which allows us to profitably concentrate multiple stores within a single market our ability to open new stores is dependent upon among other factors locating suitable sites and negotiating favorable lease terms 

our older smaller stores continue to generate significant storelevel operating income and operating cash flows and have some of the highest operating margin rates among our stores however the increased size of our newer stores allows us to offer a wider selection of products including more basic consumable merchandise thereby making them more attractive as a destination store 

the strong cash flows generated by our stores allow us to selffund infrastructure investment and new stores over the past five years cash flows from operating activities have exceeded capital expenditures 

for more information on our results of operations see managements discussion and analysis  results of operations for more information on seasonality of sales see managements discussion and analysis  seasonality and quarterly fluctuations 

cost control  we believe that substantial buying power at the 100 price point contributes to our successful purchasing strategy which includes disciplined targeted merchandise margin goals by category we believe our disciplined buying and quality merchandise help to minimize markdowns we buy products on an orderbyorder basis and have no material longterm purchase contracts or other assurances of continued product supply or guaranteed product cost no vendor accounted for more than 10 of total merchandise purchased in any of the past five years 

 

our supply chain systems continue to provide us with valuable sales information to assist our buyers and improve merchandise allocation to our stores controlling our inventory levels has resulted in more efficient distribution and store operations 

information systems we believe that investments in technology help us to increase sales and control costs our inventory management system has allowed us to improve the efficiency of our supply chain improve merchandise flow and control distribution and store operating costs 

our automatic replenishment system automatically reorders key items based on actual store level sales and inventory in 2005 and 2006 we rolled out this system to additional stores and merchandise categories at the end of 2006 we had over 800 basic everyday items on automatic replenishment as we continue to utilize this system our store management has more time to focus on customer focused activities 

pointofsale data allows us to track sales by merchandise category at the store level and assists us in planning for future purchases of inventory we believe that this information allows us to ship the appropriate product to stores at the quantities commensurate with selling patterns using this pointofsale data for planning purchases of inventory has helped us reduce our inventory per store   approximately 12 in 2005 as compared to 2004 and an additional 5 in 2006 compared to 2005 our inventory turns also increased 70 basis points in the current year 

corporate culture and values we believe that honesty and integrity doing the right things for the right reasons and treating people fairly and with respect are core values within our corporate culture we believe that running a business and certainly a public company carries with it a responsibility to be above reproach when making operational and financial decisions our management team visits and shops our stores like every customer we have an open door policy for all our associates and ideas and individual creativity are encouraged we have standards for store displays merchandise presentation and store operations our distribution centers are operated based on objective measures of performance and virtually everyone in our store support center is available to assist associates in the stores and distribution centers 

our disclosure committee meets at least quarterly and monitors our internal controls over financial reporting and ensures that our public filings contain discussions about the risks our business faces we believe that we have the controls in place to be able to certify our financial statements additionally we have complied with the updated listing requirements for the nasdaq stock market 

 

growth strategy 

store openings and square footage growth the primary factors contributing to our net sales growth have been new store openings an active store expansion and remodel program and selective mergers and acquisitions from 2002 to 2006 net sales increased at a compound annual growth rate of 143 we expect that the substantial majority of our future sales growth will come primarily from new store openings and from our store expansion and relocation program 

the following table shows the total selling square footage of our stores and the selling square footage per new store opened over the last five years our growth and productivity statistics are reported based on selling square footage because our management believes the use of selling square footage yields a more accurate measure of store productivity the selling square footage statistics for 2002 through 2006 are estimates based on the relationship of selling to gross square footage 

 

we expect to increase our selling square footage in the future by opening new stores in underserved markets and strategically increasing our presence in our existing markets via new store openings and store expansions expansions include store relocations in fiscal 2007 and beyond we plan to predominantly open stores that are approximately 9000 selling square feet and we believe this size allows us to achieve our objectives in the markets in which we plan to expand at february 3 2007 1094 of our stores totaling 505 of our selling square footage were 9000 selling square feet or larger  

in addition to new store openings we plan to continue our store expansion program to increase our net sales per store and take advantage of market opportunities we target stores for expansion based on the current sales per selling square foot and changes in market opportunities stores targeted for expansion are generally less than 6000 selling square feet in size store expansions generally increase the existing store size by approximately 6000 selling square feet 

since 1995 we have added a total of 609 stores through four mergers and several small acquisitions our acquisition strategy has been to target companies with a similar single price point concept that have shown success in operations or provide a strategic advantage we evaluate potential acquisition opportunities in our retail sector as they become available 

on march 25 2006 we completed our acquisition of 138 deal stores and paid 320 million for storerelated and other assets and 221 million for inventory these stores are located primarily in the midwest part of the united states and we have existing logistics capacity to service these stores this acquisition also included a few “combo” stores that offer an expanded assortment of merchandise including items that sell for more than 1 substantially all deal stores acquired continue to operate under the deal banner while providing us an opportunity to leverage our dollar tree infrastructure in the testing of new merchandise concepts including higher price points without disrupting the singleprice point model in our dollar tree stores 

in 2006 we also acquired the rights to 21 store leases through bankruptcy proceedings of certain discount retailers we will take advantage of these opportunities as they arise in the future 

merchandising and distribution expanding our customer base is important to our growth plans we plan to continue to stock our new stores with the everchanging merchandise that our current customers have come to appreciate in addition we are opening larger stores that contain more basic consumable merchandise to attract new customers consumable merchandise typically leads to more frequent return trips to our stores resulting in increased sales the presentation and display of merchandise in our stores are critical to communicating value to our customers and creating a more exciting shopping experience we believe our approach to visual merchandising results in higher store traffic higher sales volume and an environment that encourages impulse purchases 

a strong and efficient distribution network is critical to our ability to grow and to maintain a lowcost operating structure we expect to continue to add distribution capacity to support our store opening plans with the aim of remaining approximately one year ahead of our distribution needs in 2007 we are planning to add capacity to our briar creek distribution center which services the northeast part of the country we believe these distribution centers including the planned expansion of the briar creek distribution center in total are capable of supporting approximately 50 billion in annual sales based on current plans we will not need to add any additional distribution capacity until at least 2008 new distribution sites are strategically located to reduce stem miles maintain flexibility and improve efficiency in our store service areas 

our stores receive approximately 95 of their inventory from our distribution centers via contract carriers the remaining store inventory primarily perishable consumable items and other vendormaintained display items are delivered directly to our stores from vendors for more information on our distribution center network see “properties” 

competition 

the retail industry is highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future our value discount retail competitors include family dollar dollar general and 99 cents only family dollar and dollar general sell items for more than 1 while 99 cents only sells items at the 099 price point or below the principal methods of competition include closeout merchandise convenience and the quality of merchandise offered to the customer though we are predominantly a fixedprice point retailer we also compete with mass merchandisers such as walmart and target and regional discount retailers in addition several mass merchandisers and grocery store chains carry dollar store or “dollar zone” concepts in their stores which increases competition our sales and profits could be reduced by increases in competition especially because there are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector 

 

trademarks 

we are the owners of federal service mark registrations for dollar tree the dollar tree logo 1 dollar tree together with the related design and one priceone dollar we also own a concurrent use registration for dollar bill and the related logo during 1997 we acquired the rights to use trade names previously owned by everythings a dollar a former competitor in the 100 price point industry several trade names were included in the purchase including the marks everythings 100 we mean everything and everythings 100 the registration of which is pending with the acquisition of dollar express we became the owner of the service marks dollar express and dollar expres   we became the owners of the greenbacks all a dollar and all a dollar service marks with the acquisition of greenbacks we also became the owners of “deal” and “deal nothing over a dollar” trademarks with the acquisition of deal we have applied for federal trademark registrations for various private labels that we use to market some of our product lines 

employees 

we employed approximately 12700 fulltime and 29500 parttime associates on february 3 2007 the number of parttime associates fluctuates depending on seasonal needs we consider our relationship with our associates to be good and we have not experienced significant interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements none of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements 




 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk you should carefully consider the specific risk factors listed below together with all other information included or incorporated in this report any of the following risks may materialize and additional risks not known to us or that we now deem immaterial may arise in such event our business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected if that occurs the market price of our common stock could fall and you could lose all or part of your investment 

our profitability is especially vulnerable to cost increases 

future increase in costs such as the cost of merchandise wage levels shipping rates freight costs fuel costs and store occupancy costs may reduce our profitability as a fixed price retailer we cannot raise the sales price of our merchandise to offset cost increases unlike multiprice retailers we are primarily dependent on our ability to operate more efficiently or increase our comparable store net sales in order to offset inflation we expect comparable store net sales will increase approximately 1 to 3 in 2007 we can give you no assurance that we will be able to operate more efficiently or increase our comparable store net sales in the future please see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this form 10k for further discussion of the effect of inflation and other economic factors on our operations 

our profitability is affected by the mix of products we sell 

our gross profit could decrease if we increase the proportion of higher cost goods we sell in the future in recent years the percentage of our sales from higher cost consumable products has increased and is likely to increase in the first half of 2007 our gross profit will decrease primarily in the first two quarters in 2007 unless we are able to increase the amount of our net sales sufficiently to offset any decrease in our product margin percentage we can give you no assurance that we will be able to do so 

we may be unable to expand our square footage as profitably as planned 

we plan to expand our selling square footage by approximately 10 in 2007 to increase our sales and profits expanding our square footage profitably depends on a number of uncertainties including our ability to locate lease build out and open or expand stores in suitable locations on a timely basis under favorable economic terms we must also open or expand stores within our established geographic markets where new or expanded stores may draw sales away from our existing stores we may not manage our expansion effectively and our failure to achieve our expansion plans could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

a downturn in economic conditions could adversely affect our sales 

 

economic conditions such as those caused by recession inflation adverse weather conditions or terrorism could reduce consumer spending or cause customers to shift their spending to products we either do not sell or do not sell as profitably adverse economic conditions could disrupt consumer spending and significantly reduce our sales 

our sales and profits rely on imported merchandise which may increase in cost or become unavailable 

merchandise imported directly from overseas accounts for approximately 35 to 40 of our total purchases at retail in addition we believe that a small portion of our goods purchased from domestic vendors is imported china is the source of a substantial majority of our imports imported goods are generally less expensive than domestic goods and increase our profit margins a disruption in the flow of our imported merchandise or an increase in the cost of those goods may significantly decrease our profits risks associated with our reliance on imported goods include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we could encounter disruptions or additional costs in receiving and distributing merchandise 

our success depends on our ability to transport merchandise from our suppliers to our distribution centers and then ship it to our stores in a timely and costeffective manner we may not anticipate respond to or control all of the challenges of operating our receiving and distribution systems some of the factors that could have an adverse effect on our shipping and receiving systems or costs are 

 

 

 

 

 

sales below our expectations during peak seasons may cause our operating results to suffer materially 

our highest sales periods are the christmas and easter seasons we generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and a substantial majority of our operating and net income during the fourth quarter in anticipation we stock extra inventory and hire many temporary employees to supplement our stores an economic downturn during these periods could adversely affect our operating results particularly operating and net income to a greater extent than if a downturn occurred at other times of the year untimely merchandise delays due to receiving or distribution problems could have a similar effect sales during the easter selling season are materially affected by the timing of the easter holiday easter in fiscal 2006 was on april 16 th  while in fiscal 2007 it will be one week earlier on april 8 th  

 

pressure from competitors may reduce our sales and profits 

the retail industry is highly competitive the marketplace is highly fragmented as many different retailers compete for market share by utilizing a variety of store formats and merchandising strategies we expect competition to increase in the future because there are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector many of our current or potential competitors have greater financial resources than we do we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors please see item 1 “business” of this form 10k for further discussion of the effect of competition on our operations 

the resolution of certain legal matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations accrued liabilities and cash 

for a discussion of current legal matters please see item 3 legal proceedings of this form 10k resolution of certain matters described in that item if decided against the company could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations accrued liabilities or cash flows 

 

certain provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws could delay or discourage a takeover attempt that may be in a shareholders best interest 

 

our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may delay or discourage a takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider in his best interest these provisions among other things

 item 2 properties 

stores 

as of february 3 2007 we operated 3219 stores in 48 states as detailed below 

 

we currently lease our stores and expect to continue to lease new stores as we expand our leases typically provide for a short initial lease term generally five years with options to extend however in some cases we have initial lease terms of seven to ten years we believe this leasing strategy enhances our flexibility to pursue various expansion opportunities resulting from changing market conditions as current leases expire we believe that we will be able to obtain lease renewals if desired for present store locations or to obtain leases for equivalent or better locations in the same general area 

distribution centers 

the following table includes information about the distribution centers that we currently operate we plan to expand the briar creek distribution center in 2007 this expansion will increase the square footage of the briar creek distribution center to 10 million square feet we believe our distribution center network including this planned expansion is capable of supporting approximately 50 billion in annual sales 

 

in addition to our distribution centers noted above during the past several years we have used offsite facilities to accommodate limited quantities of seasonal merchandise 

with the exception of our salt lake city and ridgefield facilities each of our distribution centers contains advanced materials handling technologies including automated conveyor and sorting systems radiofrequency inventory tracking equipment and specialized information systems 

for more information on financing of our distribution centers see managements discussion and analysis  funding requirements 

 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

from time to time we are defendants in ordinary routine litigation or proceedings incidental to our business including allegations regarding 

 

in 2003 we were served with a lawsuit in a california state court by a former employee who alleged that employees did not properly receive sufficient meal breaks and paid rest periods along with other alleged wage and hourly violations the suit requested that the california state court certify the case as a class action this suit was dismissed with prejudice in may 2005 and the dismissal was appealed a california appeals court granted the appeal and our petition for review to the california supreme court was denied the case has been remanded to the trial court where it will likely be consolidated with a companion suit which had been filed in the same court following the trial court’s earlier dismissal we anticipate that the plaintiff will seek class certification which we will oppose 

 

in 2005 we were served with a lawsuit by former employees in oregon who allege that they did not properly receive sufficient meal breaks and paid rest periods they also allege other wage and hour violations the plaintiffs requested the court to certify classes for their various claims and the presiding judge did so with respect to two classes one alleging that our oregon employees in violation of that state’s labor laws were not paid for rest breaks and the other that upon termination of employment employees were not tendered their final pay in a timely manner other claims of the plaintiffs were dismissed by an earlier order of the court and are being appealed by the plaintiffs discovery will ensue on the certified class issues no trial is anticipated before the end of 2007 

 

in 2006 we were served with a lawsuit by a former employee in a california state court alleging that she was paid for wages with a check drawn on a bank which did not have any branches in the state an alleged violation of the states labor code that she was paid less for her work than other similar employees with the same job title based on her gender and that we did not pay her final wages in a timely manner also an alleged violation of the labor code the plaintiff requested the court to certify the case as a class action we have been successful in removing the case from state to the federal court level the parties have reached a settlement and executed an agreement which will be presented to the court for its approval on april 24 2007 the estimated settlement amount has been accrued in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of february 3 2007 

 

in 2006 we were served with a lawsuit filed in federal court in the state of alabama by a former store manager she claims that she should have been classified as a nonexempt employee under the fair labor standards act and therefore should have received overtime compensation and other benefits she filed the case as a collective action on behalf of herself and all other employees store managers similarly situated our motion requesting that the case be transferred from alabama to virginia has been denied the plaintiff now seeks entry of an order allowing nationwide notice to be sent to all store managers employed by us now or within the past three years we are contesting entry of such an order 

 

we will vigorously defend ourselves in these lawsuits we do not believe that any of these matters will individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition we cannot give assurance however that one or more of these lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the period in which they are resolved

in november 2006 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 5000 million of our common stock this amount was in addition to the 267 million remaining on the march 2005 authorization in december 2006 we entered into two agreements with a third party to repurchase approximately 1000 million of the company’s common shares under an accelerated share repurchase agreement asr the 1000 million is reflected in the table above as of february 3 2007 of the 1000 million that is recorded as a reduction to stockholders’ equity approximately 38 million is pending final settlement of the asr see additional discussion of the asr in the liquidity and capital resource section of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” found elsewhere in this report 

we anticipate that substantially all of our cash flow from operations in the foreseeable future will be retained for the development and expansion of our business the repayment of indebtedness and as authorized by our board of directors the repurchase of stock management does not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future in addition our credit facilities contain financial covenants that restrict our ability to pay cash dividends 

 




 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

in management’s discussion and analysis we explain the general financial condition and the results of operations for our company including 

 

as you read management’s discussion and analysis please refer to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10k which present the results of operations for the fiscal years ended february 3 2007 january 28 2006 and january 29 2005 in management’s discussion and analysis we analyze and explain the annual changes in some specific line items in the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year 2006 compared to the comparable fiscal year 2005 and the fiscal year 2005 compared to the comparable fiscal year 2004 

key events and recent developments 

several key events have had or are expected to have a significant effect on our results of operations you should keep in mind that 

 

overview 

our net sales are derived from the sale of merchandise two major factors tend to affect our net sales trends first is our success at opening new stores or adding new stores through acquisitions second sales vary at our existing stores from one year to the next we refer to this change as a change in comparable store net sales because we compare only those stores that are open throughout both of the periods being compared we include sales from stores expanded during the year in the calculation of comparable store net sales which has the effect of increasing our comparable store net sales the term expanded also includes stores that are relocated 

 

at february 3 2007 we operated 3219 stores in 48 states with 263 million selling square feet compared to 2914 stores with 230 million selling square feet at january 28 2006 during fiscal 2006 we opened 211 stores expanded 85 stores and closed 44 stores compared to 232 new stores opened 93 stores expanded and 53 stores closed during fiscal 2005 in addition we acquired 138 deal stores on march 25 2006 including the deal acquisition we achieved the high end of our square footage growth target of 1214 for the fiscal year in fiscal 2006 we increased our selling square footage by approximately 33 million square feet or approximately 14 of the 33 million selling square foot increase in 2006 approximately 12 million resulted from the acquisition of the deal stores and 04 million was added by expanding existing stores the average size of our stores opened in 2006 was approximately 9000 selling square feet or about 11000 gross square feet the average new store size decreased in 2006 from approximately 10000 selling square feet or about 12400 gross square feet for new stores in 2005 for 2007 we continue to plan to open stores around 9000 selling square feet or about 11000 gross square feet we believe that the 1100012500 gross square foot store size is our optimal size operationally and that this size also gives the customer an improved shopping environment that invites them to shop longer and buy more we expect the substantial majority of our future net sales growth to come from the square footage growth resulting from new store openings and expansion of existing stores 

 

fiscal 2006 ended on february 3 2007 and included 53 weeks commensurate with the retail calendar the 53 rd week in 2006 added approximately 70 million in sales fiscal 2005 ended on january 28 2006 and included 52 weeks 

in fiscal 2006 comparable store net sales increased by 46 this increase was based on 53 weeks for both periods the comparable store net sales increase was the result of increases of 19 in the number of transactions and 27 in transaction size compared to fiscal 2005 we believe comparable store net sales were positively affected by the initiatives we began putting in place in 2005 including expansion of forms of payment accepted by our stores and the rollout of freezers and coolers to more of our stores during 2006 we completed the rollout of debit card acceptance to all of our stores which has enabled us to accept electronic benefit transfer cards and we now accept food stamps in approximately 600 qualified stores we believe the expansion of forms of payment accepted by our stores has helped increase the average transaction size in our stores 

in 2006 we continued to experience a slight shift in the mix of merchandise sold to more consumables which we believe increases the traffic in our stores but have lower margin the planned shift in mix to more consumables is the result of the rollout of freezers and coolers to more stores in 2005 and 2006 at february 3 2007 we had freezers and coolers in approximately 700 stores compared to approximately 250 stores at january 28 2006 we plan to add freezers and coolers to approximately 250 more stores in 2007 which we believe will continue to pressure margins as a percentage of sales in 2007 however we believe that this will enable us to increase sales and earnings in the future by increasing the number of shopping trips made by our customers 

our pointofsale technology is now in all of our stores and this technology provides us with valuable sales and inventory information to assist our buyers and improve our merchandise allocation to our stores we believe that this has enabled us to better control our inventory resulting in more efficient distribution and store operations and increased inventory turnover using the data captured at the point of sale has enabled us to better plan our inventory purchases and helped us reduce our inventory investment per store by approximately 50 at february 3 2007 compared to january 28 2006 in addition inventory turnover has increased 70 basis points in 2006 as compared to 2005 

we must continue to control our merchandise costs inventory levels and our general and administrative expenses increases in these expenses could negatively impact our operating results 

our plans for fiscal 2007 anticipate comparable store net sales increases of approximately 1 to 3 yielding net sales in the 422 billion to 433 billion range and diluted earnings per share of 196 to 210 this guidance for 2007 is predicated on selling square footage growth of approximately 10 

 

on march 25 2006 we completed our acquisition of 138 deal stores these stores are located primarily in the midwest part of the united states and we have existing logistics capacity to service these stores this acquisition also included a few “combo” stores that offer an expanded assortment of merchandise including items that sell for more than 1 substantially all deal stores acquired continue to operate under the deal banner while providing us an opportunity to leverage our dollar tree infrastructure in the testing of new merchandise concepts including higher price points without disrupting the singleprice point model in our dollar tree stores at february 3 2007 121 of these stores were selling items priced at over 100 

we paid approximately 320 million for storerelated and other assets and 221 million for inventory the results of deal store operations are included in our financial statements since the acquisition date and did not have a significant impact on our operating results through february 3 2007 this acquisition is immaterial to our operations as a whole and therefore no proforma disclosure of financial information has been presented 

results of operations   

the following table expresses items from our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales 

 

fiscal year ended february 3 2007 compared to fiscal year ended january 28 2006 

 

net sales  net sales increased 169 or 5755 million in 2006 compared to 2005 resulting from sales in our new and expanded stores including 138 deal stores acquired in march 2006 and the 53 weeks of sales in 2006 versus 52 weeks in 2005 which accounted for approximately 70 million of the increase our sales increase was also impacted by a 46 increase in comparable store net sales for the year this increase is based on a 53week comparison for both periods comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores which we include in the calculation and to a lesser extent are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing ones 

the following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store count for fiscal years ended february 3 2007 and january 28 2006 

 

 

  of the 33 million selling square foot increase in 2006 approximately 12 million resulted from the acquisition of the deal stores and 04 million was added by expanding existing stores 

gross profit  gross profit margin decreased to 342 in 2006 compared to 345 in 2005 the decrease was primarily due to a 35 basis point increase in merchandise cost including inbound freight this increase in merchandise cost was due to a slight shift in mix to more consumables which have a lower margin higher cost merchandise at our deal stores and increased inbound domestic freight costs 

selling general and administrative expenses  selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 264 for 2006 as compared to 262 for 2005 the increase is primarily due to the following 

 

 

 

operating income  due to the reasons discussed above operating income margin decreased to 78 in 2006 compared to 84 in 2005 

income taxes  our effective tax rate was 366 in 2006 compared to 368 in 2005 the decreased tax rate for 2006 was due primarily to increased taxexempt interest on certain of our investments in the current year 

fiscal year ended january 28 2006 compared to fiscal year ended january 29 2005 

 

net sales  net sales increased 86 in 2005 compared to 2004 we attribute this 2679 million increase in net sales primarily to new stores in 2005 and 2004 which are not included in our comparable store net sales calculation partially offset by a slight decrease in comparable store net sales of 08 in 2005 our comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores which we include in the calculation and to a lesser extent are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing stores 

the following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store count for fiscal years ended january 28 2006 and january 29 2005 

 

of the 26 million selling square foot increase in 2005 approximately 05 million in selling square feet was added by expanding existing stores 

gross profit  gross profit margin decreased to 345 in 2005 compared to 356 in 2004 the decrease is primarily due to the following 

 

selling general and administrative expenses  selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 262 for 2005 and 2004 however several components had increases or decreases as noted below 

 

 

operating income  due to the reasons discussed above operating income margin decreased to 83 in 2005 compared to 94 for 2004 

interest income interest income increased 22 million in 2005 compared to 2004 because of higher investment balances in the current year and increased interest rates 

interest expense interest expense increased 48 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 this increase is primarily due to increased rates on our revolver in the current year 

income taxes  our effective tax rate was 368 in 2005 compared to 375 in 2004 the decreased tax rate for 2005 was due primarily to the resolution of tax uncertainties in the current year and increased taxexempt interest on certain of our investments 

liquidity and capital resources 

our business requires capital to build and open new stores expand our distribution network and operate existing stores our working capital requirements for existing stores are seasonal and usually reach their peak in september and october historically we have satisfied our seasonal working capital requirements for existing stores and have funded our store opening and distribution network expansion programs from internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities 

the following table compares cashrelated information for the years ended february 3 2007 january 28 2006 and january 29 2005 

 

the 477 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2006 was primarily due to increased earnings before depreciation in the current year and better payables management in the current year partially offset by approximately 200 million of rent payments for february 2007 made prior to the end of fiscal 2006 

the 448 million decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2006 compared to 2005 was the result of a 1149 million increase in net proceeds from shortterm investments which were used to help fund stock repurchases and the deal acquisition in the current year in the current year we purchased an additional 93 million of investments in a restricted account to collateralize certain longterm insurance obligations additional uses of cash for investing activities consisted of 541 million for the deal acquisition in the current year and an increase of 361 million in capital expenditures due primarily to new store growth and the installation of freezers and coolers to certain stores in the current year 

the 326 million increase in cash used in financing activities in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily resulted from 2482 million in stock repurchases in the current year compared to 1804 million in the prior year this increase was partially offset by increased proceeds from stock option exercises in the current year resulting from our higher stock prices in 2006 as compared to 2005 

the 886 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2005 was primarily due to an approximate 12 decrease in inventory per store at january 28 2006 compared to january 29 2005 the inventory per store decrease is the result of an initiative to lower backroom inventory levels and increase inventory turns through a reduction in 2005 purchases the aforementioned net cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by a decrease in deferred tax liabilities chiefly as a result of the elimination of bonus depreciation 

 

the 799 million decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2005 compared to 2004 was the result of a 342 million decrease in net purchases of investments resulting from more cash used to repurchase stock in the current year the net purchases of investments in 2005 include 299 million of investments that are in a restricted account to collateralize certain longterm insurance obligations these investments replaced higher cost standby letters of credit and surety bonds   capital expenditures also decreased 425 million in 2005 after two distribution center projects and pointofsale installations were completed in 2004 

the 2315 million change in cash used in financing activities in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily resulted from 1804 million in stock repurchases in 2005 compared to 486 million in 2004 also in 2004 we entered into a fiveyear 4500 million revolving credit facility under which we received net proceeds of 2489 million we used a portion of these proceeds to repay 1426 million of variable rate debt for our distribution centers and invested the balance in shortterm tax exempt municipal bonds 

at february 3 2007 our longterm borrowings were 2688 million and our capital lease commitments were 07 million we also have 1250 million and 500 million letter of credit reimbursement and security agreements under which approximately 848 million were committed to letters of credit issued for routine purchases of imported merchandise at february 3 2007 

in march 2005 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 3000 million of our common stock through march 2008 during fiscal 2006 we repurchased 5650871 shares for approximately 1482 million under the march 2005 authorization 

in november 2006 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 5000 million of our common stock this amount was in addition to the 270 million remaining on the march 2005 authorization in december 2006 we entered into two agreements with a third party to repurchase approximately 1000 million of the company’s common shares under an accelerated share repurchase agreement asr 

the first 500 million was executed in an “uncollared” agreement in this transaction we initially received 1656178 shares based on the market price of our stock of 3019 as of the trade date december 8 2006 a weighted average price was calculated using stock prices from december 16 2006  march 8 2007 this represents the calculation period and based on the weighted average price during this period a settlement took place in march 2007 resulting in additional funding of 33 million 

 

the remaining 500 million relates to a “collared” agreement in which we initially received 1500703 shares representing the minimum number of shares under the agreement the maximum number of shares that can be repurchased under the agreement is 1693101 the number of shares was determined based on the weighted average market price of our common stock during the same calculation period as defined in the “uncollared” agreement the weighted average market price as of february 3 2007 as defined in the “collared” agreement was 3080 therefore as of february 3 2007 we would receive an additional 122742 shares under the “collared” agreement based on the applicable accounting literature these additional shares were not included in the weighted average diluted earnings per share calculation because their effect would be antidilutive the weighted average stock price of our common stock as defined in the “collared” agreement as of march 8 2007 termination date was 3197 we received an additional 63325 shares on march 8 2007 under this agreement 

 

on march 29 2007 we entered into an agreement with a third party to repurchase approximately 1500 million of our common shares under another asr the entire 1500 million was executed under a collared agreement within two weeks of the march 29 2007 execution date we will receive the minimum number of shares up to four months after the initial execution date we will receive additional shares from the third party depending on the volume weighted average price of our common shares during that period subject to the maximum share delivery provisions of the agreement 

 

funding requirements 

overview 

we expect our cash needs for opening new stores and expanding existing stores in fiscal 2007 to total approximately 1607   million which includes capital expenditures initial inventory and preopening costs our estimated capital expenditures for fiscal 2007 are between 1700 and 1900 million including planned expenditures for our new and expanded stores the addition of freezers and coolers to approximately 250 stores an expansion of the briar creek distribution center and an expansion to our home office and data center in chesapeake va we believe that we can adequately fund our working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures for the next few years from net cash provided by operations and potential borrowings under our existing credit facilities 

the following tables summarize our material contractual obligations including both on and offbalance sheet arrangements and our commitments excluding interest on longterm borrowings in millions 

 

 

lease financing 

operating lease obligations our operating lease obligations are primarily for payments under noncancelable store leases the commitment includes amounts for leases that were signed prior to february 3 2007 for stores that were not yet open on february 3 2007 

capital lease obligations  our capital lease obligations are primarily for payments for distribution center equipment and computer equipment at the store support center 

longterm borrowings 

revolving credit facility in march 2004 we entered into a fiveyear revolving credit facility the facility the facility provides for a 4500 million line of credit including up to 500 million in available letters of credit interest is assessed under the line based on matrix pricing which currently approximates libor plus 0475 the facility among other things requires the maintenance of certain specified financial ratios restricts the payment of certain distributions and prohibits the incurrence of certain new indebtedness we used availability under this facility to repay the 1426 million of variablerate debt and to purchase shortterm investments as of february 3 2007 we had 2500 million outstanding on this facility 

 

revenue bond financing  in may 1998 we entered into an agreement with the mississippi business finance corporation under which it issued 190 million of variablerate demand revenue bonds we used the proceeds from the bonds to finance the acquisition construction and installation of land buildings machinery and equipment for our distribution facility in olive branch mississippi at february 3 2007 the balance outstanding on the bonds was 188 million these bonds are due to be fully repaid in june 2018 the bonds do not have a prepayment penalty as long as the interest rate remains variable the bonds contain a demand provision and therefore outstanding amounts are classified as current liabilities we pay interest monthly based on a variable interest rate which was 54 at february 3 2007 

commitments 

letters of credit and surety bonds  in march 2001 we entered into a letter of credit reimbursement and security agreement which provides 1250 million for letters of credit in december 2004 we entered into an additional letter of credit reimbursement and security agreement which provides 500 million for letters of credit letters of credit are generally issued for the routine purchase of imported merchandise and we had approximately 848 million of purchases committed under these letters of credit at february 3 2007 we also have approximately 315 million of letters of credit or surety bonds outstanding for our insurance programs and certain utility payment obligations at some of our stores 

freight contracts we have contracted outbound freight services from various carriers with contracts expiring through april 2009 the total amount of these commitments is approximately 571 million 

technology assets we have commitments totaling approximately 38 million to primarily purchase store technology assets for our stores during 2007 

derivative financial instruments 

we are party to one interest rate swap which allows us to manage the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations on the demand revenue bonds the swap is based on a notional amount of 188 million under the 188 million agreement as amended we pay interest to the bank that provided the swap at a fixed rate in exchange the financial institution pays us at a variableinterest rate which is similar to the rate on the demand revenue bonds the variableinterest rate on the interest rate swap is set monthly no payments are made by either party under the swap for monthly periods with an established interest rate greater than a predetermined rate the knockout rate the swap may be canceled by the bank or us and settled for the fair value of the swap as determined by market rates and expires in 2009 

because of the knockout provision in the 188 million swap changes in the fair value of that swap are recorded in earnings for more information on the interest rate swaps see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  interest rate risk 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates certain of our estimates require a high level of judgment and have the potential to have a material effect on the financial statements if actual results vary significantly   from those estimates following is a discussion of the estimates that we consider critical 

inventory valuation 

as discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weightedaverage basis cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weightedaverage basis under the retail inventory method the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated costtoretail ratio to the retail value of inventories the retail inventory method is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis 

inventory valuation methods require certain significant management estimates and judgments including estimates of future merchandise markdowns and shrink which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins the averaging required in applying the retail inventory method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns could under certain circumstances result in costs not being recorded in the proper period 

we estimate our markdown reserve based on the consideration of a variety of factors including but not limited to quantities of slow moving or seasonal carryover merchandise on hand historical markdown statistics and future merchandising plans the accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors some of which are outside of our control including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends historically we have not experienced significant differences in our estimated reserve for markdowns compared with actual results 

 

our accrual for shrink is based on the actual historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories adjusted if necessary for current economic conditions these estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger our physical inventory counts are generally taken between january and september of each year therefore the shrink accrual recorded at february 3 2007 is based on estimated shrink for most of 2006 including the fourth quarter we have not experienced significant fluctuations in historical shrink rates beyond 10 to 15 basis points in our dollar tree stores for the last two years however we have sometimes experienced higher than typical shrink in acquired stores in the year following an acquisition we periodically adjust our shrink estimates to address these factors as they become apparent 

our management believes that our application of the retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market each year on a consistent basis 

accrued expenses 

on a monthly basis we estimate certain expenses in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred our most material estimates include domestic freight expenses selfinsurance programs storelevel operating expenses such as property taxes and utilities and certain other expenses our freight and storelevel operating expenses are estimated based on current activity and historical trends and results our workers compensation and general liability insurance accruals are recorded based on actuarial valuations which are adjusted annually based on a review performed by a thirdparty actuary these actuarial valuations are estimates based on historical loss development factors certain other expenses are estimated and recorded in the periods that management becomes aware of them the related accruals are adjusted as management’s estimates change differences in managements estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual materially different from the calculated accrual our experience has been that some of our estimates are too high and others are too low historically the net total of these differences has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

income taxes 

on a quarterly basis we estimate our required income tax liability and assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets our income taxes payable are estimated based on enacted tax rates including estimated tax rates in states where our store base is growing applied to the income expected to be taxed currently the current tax liability also includes a liability for resolution of tax uncertainties management assesses the recoverability of deferred tax assets based on the availability of carrybacks of future deductible amounts and management’s projections for future taxable income we cannot guarantee that we will generate taxable income in future years historically we have not experienced significant differences in our estimates of our tax accrual in 2006 and 2005 we recognized approximately 07 million and 15 million respectively of tax benefits related to the resolution of tax uncertainties in certain states 

 

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations 

we experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales comparable store net sales operating income and net income and expect this trend to continue our results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors including 

 

our highest sales periods are the christmas and easter seasons easter was observed on march 27 2005 april 16 2006 and will be observed on april 8 2007 we generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and of our operating and net income during the fourth quarter in anticipation of increased sales activity during these months we purchase substantial amounts of inventory and hire a significant number of temporary employees to supplement our continuing store staff our operating results particularly operating and net income could suffer if our net sales were below seasonal norms during the fourth quarter or during the easter season for any reason including merchandise delivery delays due to receiving or distribution problems or consumer sentiment fiscal 2006 consisted of 53 weeks commensurate with the retail calendar this extra week contributed approximately 700 million of sales in 2006 fiscal 2007 will consist of 52 weeks 

 

our unaudited results of operations for the eight most recent quarters are shown in a table in footnote 12 of the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

inflation and other economic factors 

our ability to provide quality merchandise at a fixed price and on a profitable basis may be subject to economic factors and influences that we cannot control consumer spending could decline because of economic pressures including rising fuel prices reductions in consumer confidence and spending could have an adverse effect on our sales national or international events including war or terrorism could lead to disruptions in economies in the united states or in foreign countries where we purchase some of our merchandise these and other factors could increase our merchandise costs and other costs that are critical to our operations such as shipping and wage rates 

shipping costs  currently transpacific shipping rates are negotiated with individual freight lines and are subject to fluctuation based on supply and demand for containers and current fuel costs as a result our transpacific shipping costs in fiscal 2007 may increase compared with fiscal 2006 when we renegotiate our import shipping rates effective may 2007 we can give no assurances as to the amount of the increase as we are in the early stages of our negotiations 

minimum wage although our average hourly wage rate is significantly higher than the federal minimum wage an increase in the mandated minimum wage could increase our payroll costs in early 2007 proposals increasing the federal minimum wage to 725 per hour over a threeyear period have passed both houses of congress if the federal minimum wage were to increase over the next three years to 725 per hour we believe that it would not have a material effect on our annual payroll expenses 

new accounting pronouncements 

in july 2006 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 fin 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 109  fin 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 109 accounting for income taxes  fin 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return fin 48 also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosures and transition fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 we do not expect that the adoption of fin 48 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of our business including the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency rate fluctuations we may enter into interest rate swaps to manage exposure to interest rate changes and we may employ other risk management strategies including the use of foreign currency forward contracts we do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging purposes and we do not hold derivative instruments for trading purposes 

interest rate risk 

 

we use variablerate debt to finance certain of our operations and capital improvements these obligations expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates if interest rates increase interest expense increases conversely if interest rates decrease interest expense also decreases we believe it is beneficial to limit the variability of our interest payments   

 

to meet this objective we entered into a derivative instrument in the form of an interest rate swap to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in the variableinterest rates on the demand revenue bonds the interest rate swap reduces the interest rate exposure on this variablerate obligation under the interest rate swap we pay the bank at a fixedrate and receive variableinterest at a rate approximating the variablerate on the obligation thereby creating the economic equivalent of a fixedrate obligation under the swap no payments are made by parties under the swap for monthly periods in which the variableinterest rate is greater than the predetermined knockout rate 

 

the following table summarizes the financial terms of our interest rate swap agreement and the fair value of the interest rate swap at february 3 2007 

 

at february 3 2007 the fair value of this interest rate swap is less than 01 million hypothetically a 1 change in interest rates results in approximately a 02 million change in the amount paid or received under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement on an annual basis due to many factors management is not able to predict the changes in fair value of our interest rate swap the fair values are the estimated amounts we would pay or receive to terminate the agreement as of the reporting date these fair values are obtained from an outside financial institution

 item 1  business 

overview 

since our founding in 1986 we have become the leading operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise at the fixed price of 100 we believe the variety and quality of products we sell for 100 sets us apart from our competitors at january 28 2006 we operated 2914 singleprice point stores under the names of dollar tree dollar bills and dollar express 

since 1986 we have evolved from opening primarily mallbased stores ranging between 1500 and 2500 selling square feet to opening primarily strip shopping centerbased stores averaging 10000 to 15000 selling square feet in the past five years we have modified our average store size to reflect what we believe is our optimal store size of between 10000 and 12500 square feet our current store size reflects our expanded merchandise offerings and improved service to our customers at december 31 2001 we operated 1975 stores in 37 states at january 28 2006 we operated 2914 stores in 48 states our selling square footage increased from approximately 101 million square feet in december 2001 to 230 million square feet in january 2006 our store growth since 2001 has resulted from opening new stores and completing mergers and acquisitions we centrally manage our store and distribution operations from our corporate headquarters in chesapeake virginia 

business strategy 

value merchandise offering  we strive to exceed our customers expectations over the variety and quality of products that they can purchase for 100 by offering items that we believe typically sell for higher prices elsewhere we buy approximately 60 of our merchandise domestically and import the remaining 40 our domestic purchases include closeouts we believe our mix of imported and domestic merchandise affords our buyers flexibility that allows them to consistently exceed the customers expectation in addition direct relationships with manufacturers permit us to select from a broad range of products and customize packaging and product sizes and package quantities that meet our customers needs 

mix of basic variety and seasonal merchandise we maintain a balanced selection of products within traditional variety store categories we offer a wide selection of everyday basic products and we supplement these basic everyday items with seasonal and closeout merchandise we attempt to keep certain basic consumable merchandise in our stores continuously to establish our stores as a destination closeout merchandise is purchased opportunistically and represents less than 10 of our purchases national regional and privatelabel brands have become a bigger part of our merchandise mix 

our merchandise mix consists of 

 

index to consolidated financial statements 

 

our larger stores which appeal to a broader demographic mix carry more consumable merchandise than smaller stores we have also added freezers and coolers to approximately 200 stores in 2005 and plan to add them to approximately 250 more dollar tree stores in 2006 as a result of our larger store size and the installation of freezers and coolers in select stores consumable merchandise has grown as a percentage of purchases and sales and we expect this trend to continue the following table shows the percentage of purchases of each major product group for the years ended january 28 2006 and january 29 2005 

 

customer payment methods all of our stores accept cash and checks and approximately 700 stores accept mastercard and visa credit cards  in 2005 we expanded the tender types that we accept at our stores prior to may 2005 approximately 900 of our stores accepted debit cards by the end of 2005 approximately 2300 of our stores accepted debit cards as a result of the debit rollout we also began accepting food stamps at certain of our stores in 2005 we believe that expanding the tender types accepted at our stores helped increase the average size of transactions in the second half of 2005 

convenient locations and store size we primarily focus on opening new stores in strip shopping centers anchored by mass merchandisers whose target customers we believe to be similar to ours and in neighborhood centers anchored by large grocery retailers our stores have proven successful in metropolitan areas midsized cities and small towns the range of our store sizes allows us to target a particular location with a store that best suits that market and takes advantage of available real estate opportunities our stores are attractively designed and create an inviting atmosphere for shoppers by using bright lighting vibrant colors decorative signs and background music we enhance the store design with attractive merchandise displays we believe this design attracts new and repeat customers and enhances our image as both a destination and impulse purchase store 

for more information on retail locations and retail store leases see properties 

profitable stores with strong cash flow we maintain a disciplined costsensitive approach to store site selection in order to minimize the initial capital investment required and maximize our potential to generate high operating margins and strong cash flows we believe that our stores have a relatively small shopping radius which allows us to profitably concentrate multiple stores within a single market our ability to open new stores is dependent upon among other factors locating suitable sites and negotiating favorable lease terms 

our older smaller stores continue to generate significant storelevel operating income and operating cash flows and have some of the highest operating margin rates among our stores however the increased size of our newer stores allows us to offer a wider selection of products including more basic consumable merchandise thereby making them more attractive as a destination store 

the strong cash flows generated by our stores allow us to selffund infrastructure investment and new stores over the past five years cash flows from operating activities have exceeded capital expenditures 

for more information on our results of operations see  managements discussion and analysis  results of operations  for more information on seasonality of sales see  managements discussion and analysis  seasonality and quarterly fluctuations  

cost control  we believe that substantial buying power at the 100 price point contributes to our successful purchasing strategy which includes disciplined targeted merchandise margin goals by category we believe our disciplined buying and quality merchandise help to minimize markdowns we buy products on an orderbyorder basis and have no material longterm purchase contracts or other assurances of continued product supply or guaranteed product cost no vendor accounted for more than 10 of total merchandise purchased in any of the past five years 

our supply chain systems continue to provide us with valuable sales information to assist our buyers and improve merchandise allocation to our stores controlling our inventory levels has resulted in more efficient distribution and store operations 

index to consolidated financial statements 

 

information systems we believe that investments in technology help us to increase sales and control costs our inventory management system has allowed us to improve the efficiency of our supply chain improve merchandise flow and control distribution and store operating costs 

our automatic replenishment system automatically reorders key items based on actual store level sales and inventory in 2004 and 2005 we rolled out this system to additional stores and merchandise categories at the end of 2005 we had over 600 basic everyday items on automatic replenishment at various times during the year we also had approximately 200 more seasonal items on automatic replenishment during the applicable season as we continue to utilize this system our store management has more time to focus on customer service 

pointofsale data allows us to track sales by merchandise category at the store level and assists us in planning for future purchases of inventory we believe that this information allows us to ship the appropriate product to stores at the quantities commensurate with selling patterns during the first half of 2004 we completed the rollout of our pointofsale systems to most of our stores using this pointofsale data for planning purchases of inventory has helped us reduce our inventory per store   approximately 12 and increase inventory turns in the current year 

corporate culture and values we believe that honesty and integrity doing the right things for the right reasons and treating people fairly and with respect are core values within our corporate culture we believe that running a business and certainly a public company carries with it a responsibility to be above reproach when making operational and financial decisions our management team visits and shops our stores like every customer we have an open door policy for all our associates and ideas and individual creativity are encouraged we have standards for store displays merchandise presentation and store operations our distribution centers are operated based on objective measures of performance and virtually everyone in our store support center is available to assist associates in the stores and distribution centers 

our disclosure committee meets at least quarterly and identifies and monitors our internal controls over financial reporting and ensures that our public filings contain discussions about the risks our business faces we believe that we have the controls in place to be able to certify our financial statements additionally we have complied with the updated listing requirements for the nasdaq stock market 

 

growth strategy 

store openings and square footage growth the primary factors contributing to our net sales growth have been new store openings an active store expansion and remodel program and selective mergers and acquisitions from 2001 to 2005 net sales increased at a compound annual growth rate of 143 we expect that the substantial majority of our future sales growth will come primarily from new store openings and secondarily from our store expansion and relocation program 

the following table shows the total selling square footage of our stores and the selling square footage per new store opened over the last five years our growth and productivity statistics are reported based on selling square footage because our management believes the use of selling square footage yields a more accurate measure of store productivity the selling square footage statistics for 2001 through 2005 are estimates based on the relationship of selling to gross square footage 

 

 

we expect to increase our selling square footage in the future by opening new stores in underserved markets and strategically increasing our presence in our existing markets via new store openings and store expansions expansions include store relocations in fiscal 2006 and beyond we plan to predominantly open stores that are approximately 10000 selling square feet and we believe this size allows us to achieve our objectives in the markets in which we plan to expand at january 28 2006 673 of our stores totaling 391 of our selling square footage were 10000 selling square feet or larger  

index to consolidated financial statements 

 

in addition to new store openings we plan to continue our store expansion program to increase our net sales per store and take advantage of market opportunities we target stores for expansion based on the current sales per selling square foot and changes in market opportunities stores targeted for expansion are generally less than 6000 selling square feet in size store expansions generally increase the existing store size by approximately 6000 selling square feet 

since 1995 through the end of fiscal 2005 we have added a total of 471 stores through four mergers and several small acquisitions our acquisition strategy has been to target companies with a similar single price point concept that have shown success in operations or provide a strategic advantage we evaluate potential acquisition opportunities in our retail sector as they become available 

on march 26 2006 we completed our acquisition of 138 deal stores for approximately 305 million of store related assets and 222 million of store and distribution center inventory these amounts are subject to postclosing adjustments based on the results of physical inventory counts these stores are primarily in the midwest part of the united states and we have existing logistics capacity to service these stores with no additional capital expenditure this acquisition also includes a few “combo” stores that offer an expanded assortment of merchandise including items that sell for more than 1 substantially all deal stores acquired will continue to operate under the deal banner while providing us an opportunity to leverage our dollar tree infrastructure in the testing of new merchandise concepts including higher price points without disrupting the singleprice point model in our dollar tree stores 

in 2005 we also acquired the rights to 35 store leases through bankruptcy proceedings of certain discount retailers we will take advantage of these opportunities as they arise in the future 

merchandising and distribution expanding our customer base is important to our growth plans we plan to continue to stock our new stores with the everchanging merchandise that our current customers have come to appreciate in addition we are opening larger stores that contain more basic consumable merchandise to attract new customers consumable merchandise typically leads to more frequent return trips to our stores resulting in increased sales the presentation and display of merchandise in our stores are critical to communicating value to our customers and creating a more exciting shopping experience we believe our approach to visual merchandising results in high store traffic high sales volume and an environment that encourages impulse purchases 

a strong and efficient distribution network is critical to our ability to grow and to maintain a lowcost operating structure we opened two new distribution centers in 2004 ridgefield washington and joliet illinois while replacing our chicago distribution center we currently operate nine distribution centers we believe these distribution centers in total are capable of supporting approximately 45 billion in annual sales we expect to continue to add distribution capacity to support our store opening plans with the aim of remaining approximately one year ahead of our distribution needs based on current plans we will not need to add any distribution capacity until at least 2007 new distribution sites are strategically located to reduce stem miles maintain flexibility and improve efficiency in our store service areas 

our stores receive approximately 95 of their inventory from our distribution centers via contract carriers the remaining store inventory primarily perishable consumable items and other vendormaintained display items are delivered directly to our stores from vendors for more information on our distribution center network see “ properties ” 

competition 

the retail industry is highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future our value discount retail competitors include family dollar dollar general 99 cents only and big lots the principal methods of competition include closeout merchandise convenience and the quality of merchandise offered to the customer though we are a fixedprice point retailer we also compete with mass merchandisers such as walmart and target and regional discount retailers in addition several mass merchandisers and grocery store chains carry dollar store or “dollar zone” concepts in their stores which will increase competition our sales and profits could be reduced by increases in competition especially because there are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector

trademarks 

we are the owners of federal service mark registrations for dollar tree the dollar tree logo 1 dollar tree together with the related design and one priceone dollar a small number of our stores operate under the name only one dollar for which we have not obtained a service mark registration we also own a concurrent use registration for dollar bill and the related logo during 1997 we acquired the rights to use trade names previously owned by everythings a dollar a former competitor in the 100 price point industry several trade names were included in the purchase including the marks everythings 100 we mean everything and everythings 100 the registration of which is pending with the acquisition of dollar express we became the owner of the service marks dollar express and dollar expres   we became the owners of the greenbacks all a dollar and all a dollar service marks with the acquisition of greenbacks we have applied for federal trademark registrations for various private labels that we use to market some of our product lines 

employees 

we employed approximately 11400 fulltime and 26000 parttime associates on january 28 2006 the number of parttime associates fluctuates depending on seasonal needs we consider our relationship with our associates to be good and we have not experienced significant interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements none of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements 




 item 1a  risk factors 

an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk you should carefully consider the specific risk factors listed below together with all other information included or incorporated in this report any of the following risks may materialize and additional risks not known to us or that we now deem immaterial may arise in such event our business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected if that occurs the market price of our common stock could fall and you could lose all or part of your investment 

our profitability is especially vulnerable to cost increases 

  future increase in costs such as the cost of merchandise shipping rates freight costs fuel costs wage levels and store occupancy costs may reduce our profitability as a fixed price retailer we cannot raise the sales price of our merchandise to offset cost increases unlike multiprice retailers we are primarily dependent on our ability to operate more efficiently or increase our comparable store net sales in order to offset inflation we expect comparable store net sales will be about flat to slightly positive in 2006 we can give you no assurance that we will be able to operate more efficiently or increase our comparable store net sales in the future please see item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  of this form 10k for further discussion of the effect of inflation and other economic factors on our operations 

our profitability is affected by the mix of products we sell 

our gross profit could decrease if we increase the proportion of higher cost goods we sell in the future in recent years the percentage of our sales from higher cost consumable products has increased and is likely to increase in 2006 our gross profit will decrease unless we are able to increase the amount of our net sales sufficiently to offset any decrease in our product margin percentage we can give you no assurance that we will be able to do so 

we may be unable to expand our square footage as profitably as planned 

we plan to expand our selling square footage by approximately 12 to 14 in 2006 to increase our sales and profits expanding our square footage profitably depends on a number of uncertainties including our ability to locate lease build out and open or expand stores in suitable locations on a timely basis under favorable economic terms we must also open or expand stores within our established geographic markets where new or expanded stores may draw sales away from our existing stores we may not manage our expansion effectively and our failure to achieve our expansion plans could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

index to consolidated financial statements 

 

a downturn in economic conditions could adversely affect our sales 

 

economic conditions such as those caused by recession inflation adverse weather conditions or terrorism could reduce consumer spending or cause customers to shift their spending to products we either do not sell or do not sell as profitably for example we believe customers visited our stores less frequently last year as a result of increased gasoline prices adverse economic conditions could disrupt consumer spending and significantly reduce our sales 

our sales and profits rely on imported merchandise which may increase in cost or become unavailable 

merchandise imported directly from overseas accounts for approximately 40 of our total purchases at retail in addition we believe that a small portion of our goods purchased from domestic vendors is imported china is the source of a substantial majority of our imports imported goods are generally less expensive than domestic goods and increase our profit margins a disruption in the flow of our imported merchandise or an increase in the cost of those goods may significantly decrease our profits risks associated with our reliance on imported goods include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we could encounter disruptions or additional costs in receiving and distributing merchandise 

our success depends on our ability to transport merchandise from our suppliers to our distribution centers and then ship it to our stores in a timely and costeffective manner we may not anticipate respond to or control all of the challenges of operating our receiving and distribution systems some of the factors that could have an adverse effect on our shipping and receiving systems or costs are 

 

 

 

 

sales below our expectations during peak seasons may cause our operating results to suffer materially 

our highest sales periods are the christmas and easter seasons we generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and a substantial majority of our operating and net income during the fourth quarter in anticipation we stock extra inventory and hire many temporary employees to supplement our stores an economic downturn during these periods could adversely affect our operating results particularly operating and net income to a greater extent than if a downturn occurred at other times of the year untimely merchandise delays due to receiving or distribution problems could have a similar effect 

index to consolidated financial statements 

 

pressure from competitors may reduce our sales and profits 

the retail industry is highly competitive the marketplace is highly fragmented as many different retailers compete for market share by utilizing a variety of store formats and merchandising strategies we expect competition to increase in the future because there are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector many of our current or potential competitors have greater financial resources than we do we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors please see item 1 “ business ” of this form 10k for further discussion of the effect of competition on our operations 

the resolution of certain legal matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations accrued liabilities and cash 

for a discussion of current legal matters please see item 3 legal proceedings of this form 10k resolution of certain matters described in that item if decided against the company could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations accrued liabilities and cash 

certain provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws could delay or discourage a takeover attempt that may be in a shareholders best interest 

 

our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may delay or discourage a takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider in his best interest including takeover attempts that might result in a premium being paid for shares of our common stock these provisions among other things

 item 2  properties 

stores 

as of january 28 2006 we operated 2914 stores in 48 states as detailed below 

 

we currently lease our stores and expect to continue to lease new stores as we expand our leases typically provide for a short initial lease term generally five years with options to extend we believe this leasing strategy enhances our flexibility to pursue various expansion opportunities resulting from changing market conditions 

as current leases expire we believe that we will be able to obtain lease renewals if desired for present store locations or to obtain leases for equivalent or better locations in the same general area from time to time we may not comply with certain provisions of our store operating leases we maintain good relations with our landlords and believe that violation of these provisions if any will not have a material effect on our operations 

distribution centers 

the following table includes information about the distribution centers that we currently operate we believe our distribution center network is capable of supporting approximately 45 billion in annual sales 

 

in addition to our distribution centers noted above during the past several years we have used offsite facilities to accommodate limited quantities of seasonal merchandise 

with the exception of our salt lake city and ridgefield facilities each of our distribution centers contains advanced materials handling technologies including automated conveyor and sorting systems radiofrequency inventory tracking equipment and specialized information systems

key events and recent developments 

several key events have had or are expected to have a significant effect on our results of operations you should keep in mind that

overview 

our net sales are derived from the sale of merchandise two major factors tend to affect our net sales trends first is our success at opening new stores or adding new stores through acquisitions second sales vary at our existing stores from one year to the next we refer to this change as a change in comparable store net sales because we compare only those stores that are open throughout both of the periods being compared we include sales from stores expanded during the year in the calculation of comparable store net sales which has the effect of increasing our comparable store net sales the term expanded also includes stores that are relocated 

in fiscal 2005 we increased our selling square footage by approximately 13 of the 26 million selling square foot increase in 2005 approximately 05 million was added by expanding existing stores the increase in selling square footage fell slightly below our planned square footage growth of 1416 as we closed more stores than planned in fiscal 2005 and our average new store size was slightly below target the average size of our stores opened in 2005 was approximately 10000 selling square feet or about 12400 gross square feet in 2006 we expect to open stores slightly smaller than in 2005 these stores generate higher sales and operating income per store than our smaller stores and we believe that they create an improved shopping environment that invites customers to shop longer and buy more 

for fiscal 2005 we experienced a decrease in comparable store net sales of 08 this had a negative effect on sales as we had planned to have comparable store net sales to be flat or slightly positive for 2005 our comparable store net sales results were positively affected by the addition of 05 million selling square feet due to expanded and relocated stores during the year the decrease in comparable store net sales was the result of a decline of 26 in the number of transactions partially offset by an increase of 19 in transaction size we believe comparable store net sales were primarily affected by the impact of higher fuel costs which leave our customers with less disposable income causing them to make fewer shopping trips and the shift in the timing of easter from april 11 in 2004 to march 27 in 2005 most retailers have the ability to increase their merchandise prices or alter the mix of their merchandise to favor higherpriced items in order to increase their comparable store net sales as a fixedprice point retailer we do not have the ability to raise our prices generally our comparable store net sales will increase only if we sell more units per transaction or experience an increase in the number of transactions 

in 2005 we put initiatives in place that we believe are helping to offset some of the effect that higher fuel costs are having on our sales including increased advertising of featured products and continued expansion of forms of payment accepted by our stores currently over 2300 of our stores accept debit cards including over 1400 stores which began accepting debit cards beginning with the rollout in may 2005 we began to see positive effects from these initiatives in the second half of 2005 and believe that they will help increase comparable store net sales despite continued high fuel costs 

we experienced a slight shift in the mix of merchandise sold to more consumables which have lower margin in 2005 we believe that higher fuel costs in 2005 which left our customers with less disposable income contributed to the shift to more consumables as our customers bought more consumable and everyday items as opposed to our other merchandise categories the shift in mix to more consumables is also the result of the rollout of freezers and coolers to approximately 200 stores in 2005 as we continue to rollout freezers and coolers to approximately 250 more stores in 2006 we expect to continue to see the pressure on margins in 2006 however we believe that this will enable us to increase sales and earnings in the future by increasing the number of shopping trips made by our customers 

we expect the substantial majority of our future net sales growth to come from square footage growth resulting from new store openings and expansion of existing stores we expect the average size of new stores opened in fiscal 2006 to be approximately 9200 selling square feet per store or about 11400 gross square feet we believe this size allows us to achieve our objectives in the markets in which we plan to expand larger stores take longer to negotiate build out and open and generally have lower net sales per square foot than our smaller stores while our newer larger stores have lower sales per square foot than older smaller stores they generate higher sales and operating income dollars per store and create an improved shopping environment that invites customers to shop longer and buy more 

we must control our merchandise costs inventory levels and our general and administrative expenses increases in these expenses could negatively impact our operating results because we cannot pass on increased expenses to our customers by increasing our merchandiseselling price above the 100 price point in our dollar tree stores 

during the first half of fiscal 2004 we completed the rollout of our pointofsale systems to most of our stores our pointofsale technology provides us with valuable sales information to assist our buyers and to improve merchandise allocation to the stores we believe that it has enabled us to better control our inventory which has resulted in more efficient distribution and store operations using the data from this system to better plan our inventory purchases has helped us reduce inventory per store by almost 12 as of january 28 2006 and increase inventory turnover in the current year 

our plans for fiscal 2006 anticipate comparable store net sales increases of about flat to slightly positive yielding net sales in the 3845 to 3940 billion range and diluted earnings per share of 168 to 180 we also expect a shift in the seasonality of our earnings in 2006 easter is 20 days later in the current year positively impacting the first quarter of 2006 and there is an extra shopping day between thanksgiving and christmas which will impact the fourth quarter as compared to the prior year also the retail calendar provides us with one extra week of sales in fiscal 2006 this guidance for 2006 is based on 1214 selling square footage growth which includes the acquisition of 138 deal stores or about 5 of the overall increase see deal discussion below 

on march 26 2006 we completed our acquisition of 138 deal stores for approximately 305 million of store related assets and 222 million of store and distribution center related inventory these amounts are subject to postclosing adjustments based on the results of physical inventory counts these stores are primarily in the midwest part of the united states and we have existing logistics capacity to service these stores with no additional capital expenditure required this acquisition also includes a few “combo” stores that offer an expanded assortment of merchandise including items that sell for more than 1 substantially all deal stores acquired will continue to operate under the deal banner while providing us an opportunity to leverage our dollar tree infrastructure in the testing of new merchandise concepts including higher price points without disrupting the singleprice point model in our dollar tree stores 

in the fourth quarter of 2004 we recognized a onetime noncash aftertax adjustment of approximately 57 million or 005 per diluted share to reflect the cumulative impact of a correction of our accounting practices related to leased properties of the aforementioned amount approximately 12 million or 001 per diluted share related to 2004 this adjustment was made in light of the views of the office of the chief accountant of the securities and exchange commission expressed in a letter of february 7 2005 to the american institute of certified public accountants regarding the application of generally accepted accounting principles to operating lease accounting matters consistent with the then current industry practices we had reported straightline expenses for leases beginning on the earlier of the store opening date or the commencement date of the lease in prior periods this had the effect of excluding the preopening or buildout period of our stores generally 60 days from the calculation of the period over which we expense rent in addition amounts received as tenant allowances or rent abatements were reflected in the balance sheet as a reduction to store leasehold improvement costs instead of being classified as deferred lease credits the adjustment made to correct these practices does not affect historical or future net cash flows or the timing of payments under related leases rather this change affected the classification of costs on the consolidated statement of operations and cash flows by increasing depreciation and decreasing rent expense which is included as cost of sales in addition fixed assets and deferred liabilities increased due to the net cumulative unamortized allowances and abatements these new lease accounting practices had an approximate 002 per diluted share negative effect on 2005 earnings

results of operations   

the following table expresses items from our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales 

 

fiscal year ended january 28 2006 compared to fiscal year ended january 29 2005 

 

net sales  net sales increased 86 in 2005 compared to 2004 we attribute this 2679 million increase in net sales primarily to new stores in 2005 and 2004 which are not included in our comparable store net sales calculation partially offset by a slight decrease in comparable store net sales of 08 in 2005 our comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores which we include in the calculation and to a lesser extent are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing stores our stores larger than 10000 gross square feet continue to produce our best comparable store net sales results 

the following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store count for fiscal years ended january 28 2006 and january 29 2005 

 

of the 26 million selling square foot increase in 2005 approximately 05 million in selling square feet was added by expanding existing stores 

gross profit  gross profit margin decreased to 345 in 2005 compared to 356 in 2004 the decrease is primarily due to the following 

 

index to consolidated financial statements 

 

selling general and administrative expenses  selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 262 for 2005 and 2004 however several components had increases or decreases as noted below 

 

 

operating income  due to the reasons discussed above operating income margin decreased to 83 in 2005 compared to 94 for 2004 

interest income interest income increased 22 million in 2005 compared to 2004 because of higher investment balances in the current year and increased interest rates 

interest expense interest expense increased 48 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 this increase is primarily due to increased rates on our revolver in the current year 

income taxes  our effective tax rate was 368 in 2005 compared to 375 in 2004 the decreased tax rate for 2005 was due primarily to the resolution of tax uncertainties in the current year and increased taxexempt interest on certain of our investments 

fiscal year ended january 29 2005 compared to fiscal year ended january 31 2004 

 

net sales  net sales increased 116 in 2004 compared to 2003 we attribute this 3261 million increase in net sales primarily to new stores in 2004 and 2003 which are not included in our comparable store net sales calculation and to a slight increase in comparable store net sales of 05 in 2004 our comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores which we include in the calculation and to a lesser extent are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing stores if not for the positive effect of relocated stores our comparable store net sales results would have been negative in 2004 

the following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store count for fiscal years ended january 29 2005 and january 31 2004 

 

of the 36 million selling square foot increase in 2004 approximately 09 million in selling square feet was added by expanding existing stores 

index to consolidated financial statements 

 

gross profit  gross profit margin decreased to 356 in 2004 compared to 364 in 2003 the decrease is primarily due to the following 

 

selling general and administrative expenses  selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 262 in 2004 compared to 259 in 2003 the increase is primarily due to the following 

 

 

operating income  due to the reasons discussed above operating income margin decreased to 94 in 2004 compared to 105 for 2003 

interest expense interest expense increased 19 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 this increase is due to increased debt in the current year and 07 million of deferred financing costs that were charged to interest expense as a result of the refinancing of the 1500 million credit facility and the repayment of the 1426 million of variable rate debt in march 2004 

income taxes  our effective tax rate was 375 in 2004 compared to 385 in 2003 the decreased tax rate for 2004 was due primarily to a tax benefit of 23 million or 80 basis points related to the resolution of a tax uncertainty and approximately 06 million or 20 basis points related to tax exempt interest on our investments 

liquidity and capital resources 

our business requires capital to build and open new stores expand our distribution network and operate existing stores our working capital requirements for existing stores are seasonal and usually reach their peak in september and october historically we have satisfied our seasonal working capital requirements for existing stores and have funded our store opening and distribution network expansion programs from internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities 

the following table compares cashrelated information for the years ended january 28 2006 january 29 2005 and january 31 2004 

 

index to consolidated financial statements 

 

the 886 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2005 was primarily due to an approximate 12 decrease in inventory per store at january 28 2006 compared to january 29 2005 the inventory per store decrease is the result of an initiative to lower backroom inventory levels and increase inventory turns through a reduction in current year purchases the aforementioned net cash provided was partially offset by a decrease in deferred tax liabilities chiefly as a result of the elimination of bonus depreciation 

the 799 million decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2005 compared to 2004 was the result of a 342 million decrease in net purchases of investments resulting from more cash used to repurchase stock in the current year the net purchases of investments in the current year include 299 million of investments that are in a restricted account to collateralize certain longterm insurance obligations these investments replaced higher cost standby letters of credit and surety bonds   capital expenditures also decreased 425 million in the current year after two distribution center projects and pointofsale installations were completed in 2004 

the 2316 million change in cash used in financing activities in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily resulted from 1804 million in stock repurchases in the current year compared to 486 million in the prior year also in the prior year we entered into a fiveyear 4500 million revolving credit facility under which we received proceeds of 2500 million we used a portion of these proceeds to repay 1426 million of variable rate debt for our distribution centers and invested the balance in shortterm tax exempt municipal bonds as of january 28 2006 we had 2500 million outstanding and 2000 million available under this facility this facility bears interest at libor plus 0475 spread 

 

the 328 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2004 was primarily due to increased profitability before noncash depreciation and amortization expense increased noncash depreciation expense was primarily attributed to our square footage growth in 2004 two new distribution centers in 2004 and our continued installation of our pointofsale systems and other technology assets 

cash used in investing activities is generally expended to open new stores and to expand or relocate existing stores the 330 million increase in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily due to the following 

 

the 968 million change in cash provided by financing activities in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily the result of the following 

 

at january 28 2006 our longterm borrowings were 2690 million and our capital lease commitments were 09 million we also have a 1250 million and a 500 million letter of credit reimbursement and security agreement under which approximately 816 million were committed to letters of credit issued for routine purchases of imported merchandise at january 28 2006 

in march 2005 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 3000 million of our common stock during the next three years this authorization terminated the previous november 2002 2000 million authorization for 2005 and 2004 we repurchased 7024450 shares and 1809953 shares respectively for approximately 1804 million and 486 million respectively as of january 28 2006 we have approximately 1749 million remaining under the march 2005 authorization from january 29 2006 through march 31 2006 we have repurchased additional shares totaling 226 million under this authorization

funding requirements 

overview 

in 2005 the average investment per new store including capital expenditures initial inventory and preopening costs was approximately 508000 we expect our cash needs for opening new stores and expanding existing stores in fiscal 2006 to total approximately 1360   million which includes capital expenditures initial inventory and preopening costs our estimated capital expenditures for fiscal 2006 are between 1450 and 1550 million including planned expenditures for our new and expanded dollar tree stores improvements to the acquired deal stores and investments in technology we believe that we can adequately fund our working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures for the next few years from net cash provided by operations and borrowings under our existing credit facilities 

the following tables summarize our material contractual obligations including both on and offbalance sheet arrangements and our commitments in millions 

 

 

lease financing 

operating lease obligations our operating lease obligations are primarily for payments under noncancelable store leases the commitment includes amounts for leases that were signed prior to january 28 2006 for stores that were not yet open on january 28 2006 

capital lease obligations  our capital lease obligations are primarily for payments for distribution center equipment and computer equipment at the store support center 

longterm borrowings 

revolving credit facility in march 2004 we entered into a fiveyear revolving credit facility the facility the facility provides for a 4500 million line of credit including up to 500 million in available letters of credit bearing interest at libor plus 0475 the facility among other things requires the maintenance of certain specified financial ratios restricts the payment of certain distributions and prohibits the incurrence of certain new indebtedness we used availability under this facility to repay the 1426 million of variablerate debt and to purchase shortterm investments as of january 28 2006 we had 2500 million outstanding on this facility 

revenue bond financing  in may 1998 we entered into an agreement with the mississippi business finance corporation under which it issued 190 million of variablerate demand revenue bonds we used the proceeds from the bonds to finance the acquisition construction and installation of land buildings machinery and equipment for our distribution facility in olive branch mississippi at january 28 2006 the balance outstanding on the bonds was 190 million these bonds are due to be repaid in june 2018 the bonds do not have a prepayment penalty as long as the interest rate remains variable the bonds contain a demand provision and therefore outstanding amounts are classified as current liabilities we pay interest monthly based on a variable interest rate which was 46 at january 28 2006 

index to consolidated financial statements 

 

commitments 

letters of credit and surety bonds  in march 2001 we entered into a letter of credit reimbursement and security agreement which provides 1250 million for letters of credit in december 2004 we entered into an additional letter of credit reimbursement and security agreement which provides 500 million for letters of credit both of these letters of credit are generally issued for the routine purchase of imported merchandise approximately 816 million was committed to letters of credit at january 28 2006 we also have letters of credit or surety bonds outstanding for our insurance programs and certain utility payment obligations at some of our stores 

freight contracts we have contracted outbound freight services from various carriers with contracts expiring through april 2008 the total amount of these commitments is approximately 472 million 

technology assets we have commitments totaling approximately 65 million to primarily purchase store technology assets for our stores during 2006 

derivative financial instruments 

we are party to two interest rate swaps which allow us to manage the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations on the demand revenue bonds and a portion of our revolving credit facility the swaps are based on notional amounts of 190 million and 250 million under the 190 million agreement as amended we pay interest to the bank that provided the swap at a fixed rate in exchange the financial institution pays us at a variableinterest rate which is similar to the rate on the demand revenue bonds the variableinterest rate on the interest rate swap is set monthly no payments are made by either party under the swap for monthly periods with an established interest rate greater than a predetermined rate the knockout rate the swap may be canceled by the bank or us and settled for the fair value of the swap as determined by market rates and expires in 2009 

the 250 million interest rate swap agreement is used to manage the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations on a portion of our revolving credit facility under this agreement we pay interest to a financial institution at a fixed rate of 543 in exchange the financial institution pays us at a variableinterest rate which approximates the floating rate on the debt excluding the credit spread the interest rate on the swap is subject to adjustment monthly the swap is effective through march 2006 but it may be canceled by the bank or us and settled for the fair value of the swap as determined by market rates 

because of the knockout provision in the 190 million swap changes in the fair value of that swap are recorded in earnings changes in fair value on our 250 million interest rate swap are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets because the swap qualifies for hedge accounting treatment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 133 as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 138 the amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income are subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the related interest affects earnings

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates certain of our estimates require a high level of judgment and have the potential to have a material effect on the financial statements if actual results vary significantly   from those estimates following is a discussion of the estimates that we consider critical 

inventory valuation 

as discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weightedaverage basis cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weightedaverage basis under the retail inventory method the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated costtoretail ratio to the retail value of inventories the retail inventory method is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis 

inventory valuation methods require certain significant management estimates and judgments including estimates of future merchandise markdowns and shrink which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins the averaging required in applying the retail inventory method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns could under certain circumstances result in costs not being recorded in the proper period 

index to consolidated financial statements 

 

we estimate our markdown reserve based on the consideration of a variety of factors including but not limited to quantities of slow moving or carryover seasonal merchandise on hand historical markdown statistics and future merchandising plans the accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors some of which are outside of our control including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends historically we have not experienced significant differences in our estimated reserve for markdowns compared with actual results

our accrual for shrink is based on the actual historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories adjusted if necessary for current economic conditions these estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger our physical inventory counts are generally taken between january and august of each year therefore the shrink accrual recorded at january 28 2006 is based on estimated shrink for most of 2005 including the fourth quarter we have not experienced significant fluctuations in historical shrink rates in our dollar tree stores for the last two years however we have sometimes experienced higher than typical shrink in acquired stores in the year following an acquisition we periodically adjust our shrink estimates to address these factors as they become apparent 

our management believes that our application of the retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market on a yeartoyear and consistent basis 

accrued expenses 

on a monthly basis we estimate certain expenses in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred our most material estimates include domestic freight expenses selfinsurance programs storelevel operating expenses such as property taxes and utilities and certain other expenses our freight and storelevel operating expenses are estimated based on current activity and historical results our workers compensation and general liability insurance accruals are recorded based on actuarial valuations which are adjusted annually based on a review performed by a thirdparty actuary these actuarial valuations are estimates based on historical loss development factors certain other expenses are estimated and recorded in the periods that management becomes aware of them the related accruals are adjusted as management’s estimates change differences in managements estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual materially different from the calculated accrual our experience has been that some of our estimates are too high and others are too low historically the net total of these differences has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

income taxes 

on a quarterly basis we estimate our required income tax liability and assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets our income taxes payable are estimated based on enacted tax rates including estimated tax rates in states where our store base is growing applied to the income expected to be taxed currently the current tax liability includes a liability for resolution of tax uncertainties management assesses the recoverability of deferred tax assets based on the availability of carrybacks of future deductible amounts and management’s projections for future taxable income we cannot guarantee that we will generate taxable income in future years historically we have not experienced significant differences in our estimates of our tax accrual however in 2005 and 2004 we recognized approximately 15 million and 21 million respectively of tax benefits related to the resolution of tax uncertainties 

index to consolidated financial statements 

 

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations 

we experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales comparable store net sales operating income and net income and expect this trend to continue our results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors including 

 

our highest sales periods are the christmas and easter seasons easter was observed on april 11 2004 march 27 2005 and will be observed on april 16 2006 due to the 20day longer easter selling season in 2006 we expect a larger portion of our annual earnings to be realized in the first quarter of 2006 as compared to 2005 we generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and a substantial majority of our operating and net income during the fourth quarter in anticipation of increased sales activity during these months we purchase substantial amounts of inventory and hire a significant number of temporary employees to supplement our continuing store staff our operating results particularly operating and net income could suffer if our net sales were below seasonal norms during the fourth quarter or during the easter season for any reason including merchandise delivery delays due to receiving or distribution problems or consumer sentiment 

our unaudited results of operations for the eight most recent quarters are shown in a table in footnote 13 of the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

inflation and other economic factors 

our ability to provide quality merchandise at a fixed price and on a profitable basis may be subject to economic factors and influences that we cannot control consumer spending could decline because of economic pressures including rising fuel prices reductions in consumer confidence and spending could have an adverse effect on our sales national or international events including war or terrorism could lead to disruptions in economies in the united states or in foreign countries where we purchase some of our merchandise these and other factors could increase our merchandise costs and other costs that are critical to our operations such as shipping and wage rates 

shipping costs  in the past we have experienced annual increases of as much as 33 in our transpacific shipping rates due primarily to rate increases imposed by the transpacific ocean carriers currently transpacific shipping rates are negotiated with individual freight lines and are subject to fluctuation based on supply and demand for containers and current fuel costs we imported 18838 fortyfoot equivalent containers in 2005 and expect this number to increase in fiscal 2006 proportionately to sales growth as a result our transpacific shipping costs in fiscal 2006 may increase compared with fiscal 2005 when we renegotiate our import shipping rates effective may 2006 we can give no assurances as to the amount of the increase as we are in the early stages of our negotiations 

because of the increase in fuel costs throughout 2005 and the threat of continued increases in 2006 we expect increased fuel surcharges from our domestic contract carriers compared with past years based on current fuel prices we estimate that the costs resulting from increased fuel surcharges may approximate 20 to 30 million in 2006 we expect to offset a portion of this potential increase with improved operational efficiencies   

minimum wage although our average hourly wage rate is significantly higher than the federal minimum wage an increase in the mandated minimum wage could significantly increase our payroll costs in prior years proposals increasing the federal minimum wage by 100 per hour have narrowly failed to pass both houses of congress however if the federal minimum wage were to increase by 100 per hour we believe that our annual payroll expenses would increase by approximately 40 basis points unless we realize offsetting cost reductions

new accounting pronouncements 

effective january 29 2006 the first day of fiscal 2006 the company adopted fas 123r this statement is a revision of fas 123 accounting for stockbased compensation  and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 25 fas 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values the company adopted fas 123r using the modified prospective method which requires expensing of all sharebased payments granted on or after january 29 2006 and for all awards granted to employees that were unvested as of january 29 2006 

on december 15 2005 the compensation committee of the board of directors of the company approved the acceleration of the vesting date of all previously issued outstanding and unvested options under all current stock option plans including the 1995 stock incentive plan the 2003 equity incentive plan and the 2004 executive officer equity plan effective as of december 15 2005 at the effective date almost all of these options had exercise prices higher than the actual stock price the company made the decision to accelerate vesting of these options to give employees increased performance incentives and to enhance current retention this decision also eliminated noncash compensation expense that would have been recorded in future periods following the company’s adoption of fas 123r on january 29 2006 future compensation expense has been reduced by 149 million over a period of four years during which the options would have vested as a result of the option acceleration program this amount is net of compensation expense of 150000 recognized in fiscal 2005 for estimated forfeiture of certain in the money options   

in march 2006 the compensation committee of our board of directors granted approximately 317500 options the grant date for these options is march 31 2006 the fair value of these options of approximately 35 million will be recognized over the threeyear vesting period 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of our business including the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency rate fluctuations we may enter into interest rate swaps to manage exposure to interest rate changes and we may employ other risk management strategies including the use of foreign currency forward contracts we do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging purposes and we do not hold derivative instruments for trading purposes 

interest rate risk 

 

we use variablerate debt to finance certain of our operations and capital improvements these obligations expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates if interest rates increase interest expense increases conversely if interest rates decrease interest expense also decreases we believe it is beneficial to limit the variability of our interest payments   

to meet this objective we entered into derivative instruments in the form of interest rate swaps to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in the variableinterest rates on the obligations the interest rate swaps reduce the interest rate exposure on these variablerate obligations under the interest rate swap we pay the bank at a fixedrate and receive variableinterest at a rate approximating the variablerate on the obligation thereby creating the economic equivalent of a fixedrate obligation under the 190 million interest rate swap no payments are made by parties under the swap for monthly periods in which the variableinterest rate is greater than the predetermined knockout rate 

the following table summarizes the financial terms of our interest rate swap agreements and the fair value of each interest rate swap at january 28 2006 

 

index to consolidated financial statements 

 

hypothetically a 1 change in interest rates results in approximately a 04 million change in the amount paid or received under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements on an annual basis due to many factors management is not able to predict the changes in fair value of our interest rate swaps the fair values are the estimated amounts we would pay or receive to terminate the agreements as of the reporting date these fair values are obtained from an outside financial institution

overview 

  

since our founding in 1986 we have become the leading operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise at the fixed price of 100 we believe the variety and quality of products we sell for 100 sets us apart from our competitors at january 29 2005 we operated 2735 singleprice point stores under the names of dollar tree dollar bills dollar express only one dollar and only one 

  

since 1986 we have evolved from opening primarily mallbased stores ranging between 1500 and 2500 selling square feet to opening primarily strip shopping centerbased stores averaging 10000 to 15000 selling square feet in the past five years we gradually increased the average size of our stores as we improved our merchandise offerings and service to our customers at december 31 1999 we operated 1507 stores in 33 states at january 29 2005 we operated 2735 stores in 48 states our selling square footage increased from approximately 61 million square feet in december 1999 to 204 million square feet in january 2005 our store growth since 1999 has resulted from opening new stores and completing mergers and acquisitions we centrally manage our store and distribution operations from our corporate headquarters in chesapeake virginia 

  

change in fiscal year end 

  

in january 2003 we changed our fiscal year end to a retail fiscal year ending on the saturday closest to january 31 

  

business strategy 

  

value merchandise offering  we strive to exceed our customers’ expectations over the variety and quality of products that they can purchase for 100 by offering items that we believe typically sell for higher prices elsewhere we buy approximately 60 of our merchandise domestically and import the remaining 40 our domestic purchases include closeouts we believe our mix of imported and domestic merchandise affords our buyers flexibility that allows them to consistently exceed the customer’s expectation in addition direct relationships with manufacturers permit us to select from a broad range of products and customize packaging and product sizes and package quantities that meet our customers’ needs 

  

mix of basic variety and seasonal merchandise we maintain a balanced selection of products within traditional variety store categories we offer a wide selection of everyday basic products and we supplement these basic everyday items with seasonal and closeout merchandise we attempt to keep certain basic consumable merchandise in our stores continuously to establish our stores as a destination closeout merchandise is purchased opportunistically and represents less than 10 of our purchases national regional and privatelabel brands have become a bigger part of our merchandise mix 

  

our merchandise mix consists of 

  

   

   

   

our larger stores which appeal to a broader demographic mix carry more consumable merchandise than smaller stores as a result consumable merchandise has grown as a percentage of purchases and sales the following table shows the percentage of purchases of each major product group for the years ended january 29 2005 and january 31 2004 

  

   

index to financial statements convenient locations and store size we primarily focus on opening new stores in strip shopping centers anchored by mass merchandisers whose target customers we believe to be similar to ours and in neighborhood centers anchored by large grocery retailers our stores have proven successful in metropolitan areas midsized cities and small towns the range of our store sizes allows us to target a particular location with a store that best suits that market and takes advantage of available real estate opportunities our stores are attractively designed and create an inviting atmosphere for shoppers by using bright lighting vibrant colors decorative signs and background music we enhance the store design with attractive merchandise displays we believe this design attracts new and repeat customers and enhances our image as both a destination and impulse purchase store 

  

for more information on retail locations and retail store leases see “ properties” 

  

profitable stores with strong cash flow we maintain a disciplined costsensitive approach to store site selection in order to minimize the initial capital investment required and maximize our potential to generate high operating margins and strong cash flows we believe that our stores have a relatively small shopping radius which allows us to profitably concentrate multiple stores within a single market our ability to open new stores is dependent upon among other factors locating suitable sites and negotiating favorable lease terms 

  

our older smaller stores continue to generate significant storelevel operating income and operating cash flows and have some of the highest operating margins among our stores however the increased size of our newer stores allows us to offer a wider selection of products including more basic consumable merchandise thereby making them more attractive as a destination store 

  

the strong cash flows generated by our stores allow us to selffund infrastructure investment and new stores over the past five years cash flows from operating activities have exceeded capital expenditures 

  

for more information on our results of operations see “management’s discussion and analysis – results of operations” for more information on seasonality of sales see “management’s discussion and analysis – seasonality and quarterly fluctuations” 

  

cost control  we believe that substantial buying power at the 100 price point contributes to our successful purchasing strategy which includes disciplined targeted merchandise margin goals by category we believe our disciplined buying and quality merchandise help to minimize markdowns we buy products on an orderbyorder basis and have no material longterm purchase contracts or other assurances of continued product supply or guaranteed product cost no vendor accounted for more than 10 of total merchandise purchased in any of the past five years 

  

during 2002 we began to upgrade our supply chain systems and identified other processes that could be improved using technology these new systems continue to provide us with valuable sales information to assist our buyers and improve merchandise allocation to our stores controlling our inventory levels will result in more efficient distribution and store operations 

  

payroll and related costs are a significant component of our selling general and administrative costs accordingly we believe that more efficient use of labor hours in our stores could increase our profitability 

  

information systems we believe that investments in appropriate technology help us to increase sales and control costs in 2002 we implemented a new inventory management system our new system has allowed us to improve the efficiency of our supply chain improve merchandise flow and control distribution and store operating costs 

  

in 2003 we piloted our automatic replenishment system this system automatically reorders key items based on actual store level sales and inventory in 2004 we rolled out this system to additional stores and merchandise categories in 2005 we expect to roll this system out to even more stores and more categories up to 500 stockkeeping units as we utilize this system our store management has more time to focus on customer service 

  

pointofsale data allows us to track sales by merchandise category at the store level and assists us in planning for future purchases of inventory we believe that this information will allow us to ship the appropriate product to stores at the quantities 

  

index to financial statements commensurate with selling patterns during the first half of 2004 we completed the rollout of our pointofsale systems to most of our stores 

  

corporate culture and values we believe that honesty and integrity doing the right things for the right reasons and treating people fairly and with respect are core values within our corporate culture we believe that running a business and certainly a public company carries with it a responsibility to be above reproach when making operational and financial decisions our management team visits and shops our stores like every customer we have an open door policy to all our associates and ideas and individual creativity are encouraged we have standards for store displays merchandise presentation and store operations our distribution centers are operated based on objective measures of performance and virtually everyone in our store support center is available to help associates in the stores and distribution centers get their jobs done 

  

our disclosure committee meets at least quarterly and identifies and monitors our internal controls over financial reporting and ensures that our public filings contain discussions about the risks our business faces we believe that we have the controls in place to be able to certify our financial statements additionally we have complied with the updated listing requirements for the nasdaq stock market 

  

growth strategy 

  

store openings and square footage growth the primary factors contributing to our net sales growth have been new store openings an active store expansion and remodel program and selective mergers and acquisitions from 2000 to 2004 net sales increased at a compound annual growth rate of 167 and operating income increased at a compound annual growth rate of 112 we expect that the substantial majority of our future sales growth will come primarily from new store openings and secondarily from our store expansion and remodeling program 

  

the following table shows the total selling square footage of our stores and the selling square footage per new store opened over the last five years we began opening larger stores after the acquisition of 98 cent clearance center in 1998 our growth and productivity statistics are reported based on selling square footage prospectively because our management believes the use of selling square footage yields a more accurate measure of store productivity the selling square footage statistics for 2000 through 2004 are estimates based on the relationship of selling to gross square footage 

  

   

we expect to increase our selling square footage in the future by opening new stores in underserved markets and strategically increasing our presence in our existing markets via new store openings and store expansions expansions include store relocations in fiscal 2005 and beyond we plan to predominantly open stores that are approximately 10000 selling square feet and we believe this size allows us to achieve our objectives in the markets in which we plan to expand at january 29 2005 551 of our stores totaling 364 of our selling square footage were 10000 selling square feet or larger 

  

in addition to new store openings we plan to continue our store expansion program to increase our net sales per store and take advantage of market opportunities we target stores for expansion based on the current sales per selling square foot and changes in market opportunities stores targeted for expansion are generally less than 4000 selling square feet in size store expansions generally increase the existing store size by approximately 6000 to 10000 selling square feet 

  

since 1995 we have added a total of 471 stores through four mergers and several small acquisitions our acquisition strategy has been to target companies with a similar single price point concept that have shown success in operations or provide a strategic advantage we evaluate potential acquisition opportunities in our retail sector as they become available 

  

in 2004 we also acquired the rights to 42 store leases through proceedings associated with the bankruptcy of a former discount retailer we will take advantage of these opportunities as they arise in the future 

  

index to financial statements merchandising and distribution expanding our customer base is important to our growth plans we plan to continue to stock our new stores with the everchanging merchandise that our current customers have come to appreciate in addition we are opening larger stores that contain more basic consumable merchandise to attract new customers consumable merchandise typically leads to more frequent return trips to our stores resulting in increased sales the presentation and display of merchandise in our stores are critical to communicating value to our customers and creating a more exciting shopping experience we believe our approach to visual merchandising results in high store traffic high sales volume and an environment that encourages impulse purchases 

  

a strong and efficient distribution network is key to our ability to grow and to maintain a lowcost operating structure we opened two new distribution centers in 2004 ridgefield washington and joliet illinois which was a replacement for our chicago distribution center we currently operate nine distribution centers we believe these distribution centers in total will be capable of supporting approximately 45 billion in annual sales we expect to continue to add distribution capacity to support our store opening plans with the aim of remaining approximately one year ahead of our distribution needs based on current plans we will not need to add any distribution capacity in 2005 new distribution sites are strategically located to reduce stem miles maintain flexibility and improve efficiency in our store service areas 

  

our stores receive approximately 95 of their inventory from our distribution centers via contract carriers the remaining store inventory primarily perishable consumable items and other vendormaintained display items are delivered directly to our stores from vendors for more information on our distribution center network see “properties” 

  

competition 

  

the retail industry is highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future the value discount retail sector currently represents approximately 10 of the 300 billion discount retail market and appears to be the fastest growing sector our value discount retail competitors include family dollar dollar general 99 cents only and big lots the principal methods of competition include convenience and the quality of merchandise offered to the customer though we are a fixedprice point retailer we also compete with mass merchandisers such as walmart and target and regional discount retailers in addition several mass merchandisers and grocery store chains are now testing “dollar store” or “dollar zone” concepts in their stores which will increase competition our sales and profits could be reduced by increases in competition especially because there are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector 

  

trademarks 

  

we are the owners of federal service mark registrations for “dollar tree” the “dollar tree” logo “1 dollar tree” together with the related design and “one priceone dollar” a small number of our stores operate under the name “only one dollar” for which we have not obtained a service mark registration we also own a concurrent use registration for “dollar bill” and the related logo during 1997 we acquired the rights to use trade names previously owned by everything’s a dollar a former competitor in the 100 price point industry several trade names were included in the purchase including the marks “everything’s 100 we mean everything” and “everything’s 100” the registration of which is pending with the acquisition of dollar express we became the owner of the service marks “dollar express” and “dollar expres” we became the owners of the “greenbacks all a dollar” and “all a dollar” service marks with the acquisition of greenbacks we have applied for federal trademark registrations for various private labels that we use to market some of our product lines 

  

employees 

  

we employed approximately 11040 fulltime and 19115 parttime associates on january 29 2005 the number of parttime associates fluctuates depending on seasonal needs we consider our relationship with our associates to be good and we have not experienced significant interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements none of our employees is subject to collective bargaining agreements

 item 2 properties 

  

stores 

  

as of january 29 2005 we operated 2735 stores in 48 states as detailed below 

  

   

we currently lease our stores and expect to continue to lease new stores as we expand our leases typically provide for a short initial lease term generally five years with options to extend we believe this leasing strategy enhances our flexibility to pursue various expansion opportunities resulting from changing market conditions 

  

as current leases expire we believe that we will be able to obtain lease renewals if desired for present store locations or to obtain leases for equivalent or better locations in the same general area from time to time we may not comply with certain provisions of our store operating leases we maintain good relations with our landlords and believe that violation of these provisions if any will not have a material effect on our operations 

  

distribution centers 

  

the following table includes information about the distribution centers that we currently operate we believe our distribution center network is capable of supporting approximately 45 billion in annual sales 

  

   

in addition to our distribution centers noted above during the past several years we have used offsite facilities to accommodate limited quantities of seasonal merchandise 

  

with the exception of our salt lake city and ridgefield facilities each of our distribution centers contains advanced materials handling technologies including automated conveyor and sorting systems radiofrequency inventory tracking equipment and specialized information systems 

  

we have two former distribution centers for which we are liable for future rents the leases on these facilities expire in june 2005 and september 2005 we recorded a charge of approximately 12 million in 2004 for our future obligation under the lease that expires in june 2005 we recorded a charge in 1998 for our future obligation under the lease that expires in september 2005

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

from time to time we are defendants in ordinary routine litigation and proceedings incidental to our business including allegations regarding 

  

   

   

   

   

we were sued in california in 2003 by a former employee who alleged that employees did not properly receive sufficient meal period breaks and paid rest periods he also alleged other wage and hourly violations the suit requests that the california state court certify the case as a class action in 2005 we were threatened with a suit by former employees in oregon who allege that they did not properly receive sufficient meal period breaks and paid rest periods they also allege other wage and hour violations we anticipate that they will request the oregon state court to certify the case as a class action 

  

we were sued by mag instrument for damages including treble damages for the sale of 850000 to 1000000 flashlights the united states district court in california has ruled that the flashlights infringe mag’s patent we intend to appeal this ruling mag also claims that the flashlights infringe its trademark mag instrument’s damage expert claims that mag is owed at least 416 for each unit we sold plus enhanced or treble damages as well as its attorney’s fees we believe that mag has significantly overstated its damage estimate and that it is not entitled to an award of treble damages or attorney’s fees 

  

we will vigorously defend ourselves in these lawsuits we do not believe that any of these matters will individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition we cannot assure you however that one or more of these lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operation for the period in which they are resolved

key events and recent developments 

  

several key events have had or are expected to have a significant effect on our results of operations you should keep in mind that 

  

   

   

   

   

   

index to financial statements overview 

  

our net sales are derived from the sale of merchandise two major factors tend to affect our net sales trends first is our success at opening new stores or adding new stores through mergers or acquisitions second sales vary at our existing stores from one year to the next we refer to this change as a change in comparable store net sales because we compare only those stores that are open throughout both of the periods being compared we include sales from stores expanded during the year in the calculation of comparable store net sales which has the effect of increasing our comparable store net sales the term ‘expanded’ also includes stores that are relocated 

  

in fiscal 2004 we increased our selling square footage by approximately 21 of this 36 million selling square foot increase approximately 09 million was added by expanding existing stores while we met our square footage growth target in 2004 many of these stores opened later than planned during the year resulting in lower overall sales than planned our net comparable store net sales increase for fiscal 2004 was 05 which was lower than planned if not for the positive effect of relocated stores our comparable store net sales results would have been negative in 2005 we will focus on reengineering our real estate process which includes timely opening of new stores and relocated stores and have therefore planned for square footage growth of 1416 

  

most retailers have the ability to increase their merchandise prices or alter the mix of their merchandise to favor higherpriced items in order to increase their comparable store net sales as a fixedprice point retailer we do not have the ability to raise our prices generally our comparable store net sales will increase only if we sell more units per transaction or experience an increase in transactions 

  

we expect the substantial majority of our future net sales growth to come from square footage growth resulting from new store openings and expansion of existing stores we expect the average size of new stores opened in fiscal 2005 to be approximately 10000 selling square feet per store or about 12500 gross square feet we believe this size allows us to achieve our objectives in the markets in which we plan to expand larger stores take longer to negotiate build out and open and generally have lower net sales per square foot than our smaller stores while our newer larger stores have lower sales per square foot than older smaller stores they generate higher sales and operating income per store and create an improved shopping environment that invites customers to shop longer and buy more when our larger stores become the majority of our store base which we expect to occur by the end of 2005 we believe our net sales per square foot will begin to rise 

  

we must control our merchandise costs inventory levels and our general and administrative expenses increases in these expenses could negatively impact our operating results because we cannot pass on increased expenses to our customers by increasing our merchandiseselling price above the 100 price point 

  

our pointofsale technology provides us with valuable sales information to assist our buyers and to improve merchandise allocation to the stores we believe that it will enable us to better control our inventory which will result in more efficient distribution and store operations during the first half of fiscal 2004 we completed the rollout of our pointofsale systems to most of our stores due to the fact that this rollout is now substantially complete we expect our depreciation expense as a percentage of sales to be about flat for fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 

  

our plans for fiscal 2005 operations anticipate comparable store net sales increases of flat to slightly positive net sales in the 34 to 35 billion range and diluted earnings per share of 177 to 187 we also expect a shift in the seasonality of our earnings in 2005 for example the easter selling season is 16 days shorter in the current year impacting the first quarter of 2005 and there is an extra day between thanksgiving and christmas which will impact the fourth quarter as compared to the prior year 

  

index to financial statements we recognized a onetime noncash aftertax adjustment of approximately 57 million or 005 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2004 to reflect the cumulative impact of a correction of our accounting practices related to leased properties of the aforementioned amount approximately 12 million or 001 per diluted share relates to the current year this adjustment was made in light of the views of the office of the chief accountant of the securities and exchange commission expressed in a letter of february 7 2005 to the american institute of certified public accountants regarding the application of generally accepted accounting principles to operating lease accounting matters consistent with industry practices in prior periods we had reported straight line expenses for leases beginning on the earlier of the store opening date or the commencement date of the lease this had the effect of excluding the preopening or buildout period of our stores generally 60 days from the calculation of the period over which we expense rent in addition amounts received as tenant allowances or rent abatements were reflected in the balance sheet as a reduction to store leasehold improvement costs instead of being classified as deferred lease credits the adjustment made to correct these practices does not affect historical or future net cash flows or the timing of payments under related leases rather this change affected the classification of costs on the statement of operations and cash flows by increasing depreciation and decreasing rent expense which is included as cost of sales in addition fixed assets and deferred liabilities increased due to the net cumulative unamortized allowances and abatements we believe that the new lease accounting practices will have a 001 per diluted share effect on 2005 earnings 

  

results of operations 

  

the following table expresses items from our statements of operations as a percentage of net sales 

  

   

fiscal year ended january 29 2005 compared to fiscal year ended january 31 2004 

  

net sales  net sales increased 116 in 2004 compared to 2003 we attribute this 3261 million increase in net sales primarily to new stores in 2004 and 2003 which are not included in our comparable store net sales calculation and to a slight increase in comparable store net sales of 05 in 2004 comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores which we include in the calculation and to a lesser extent are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing stores if not for the positive effect of relocated stores our comparable store net sales results would have been negative in 2004 our stores larger than 10000 square feet continue to produce our best comparable store net sales results 

  

index to financial statements the following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store size and count for fiscal years ended january 29 2005 and january 31 2004 

  

   

of the 36 million selling square foot increase in 2004 approximately 09 million in selling square feet was added by expanding existing stores 

  

gross profit  gross profit margin decreased to 356 in 2004 compared to 364 in 2003 the decrease is primarily due to the following 

  

   

   

   

   

selling general and administrative expenses  selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 262 in 2004 compared to 259 in 2003 the increase is primarily due to the following 

  

   

   

   

   

operating income  due to the reasons discussed above operating income margin decreased to 94 in 2004 compared to 105 for 2003 

  

interest expense interest expense increased 19 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 this increase is due to increased debt in the current year and 07 million of deferred financing costs that were charged to interest expense as a result of the refinancing of the 1500 million credit facility and the repayment of the 1426 million of variable rate debt in march 2004 

  

income taxes  our effective tax rate was 375 in 2004 compared to 385 in 2003 the decreased tax rate for 2004 was due primarily to a onetime tax benefit of 23 million or 80 basis points related to the resolution of a tax uncertainty and approximately 06 million or 20 basis points related to tax exempt interest on our investments

net sales  net sales increased 187 in 2003 compared to 2002 we attribute this 4420 million increase in net sales primarily to new stores in 2003 and 2002 which are not included in our comparable store net sales calculation and to a comparable store net sales increase of 29 in 2003 comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores which we include in the calculation and to a lesser extent are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing stores our comparable store net sales increase was due to our expanded and relocated stores net sales in our larger newer stores particularly the stores over 10000 square feet have been stronger than those in our smaller older stores 

  

the following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store size and count for fiscal years ended january 31 2004 and february 1 2003 

  

   

of the 36 million selling square foot increase in 2003 approximately 09 million selling square feet was added by expanding existing stores 

  

gross profit  gross profit margin was 364 in 2003 and 2002 while gross profit margin remained consistent year to year the changes in the components of gross margin are detailed below 

  

   

index to financial statements    

   

selling general and administrative expenses  selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales remained unchanged at 259 in 2003 the changes in the components of selling general and administrative expenses are detailed below 

  

   

   

operating income  due to the reasons discussed above operating income margin was consistent at 105 for 2003 and 2002 

  

interest income and expense  interest income as a percentage of net sales was consistent at 01 in 2003 and 2002 interest expense increased 36 million primarily due to the consolidation of our variable interest entity effective january 1 2003 

  

income taxes  our effective tax rate was 385 in 2003 and 2002 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

our business requires capital to build and open new stores expand our distribution network and operate existing stores our working capital requirements for existing stores are seasonal and usually reach their peak in september and october historically we have satisfied our seasonal working capital requirements for existing stores and have funded our store opening and expansion programs from internally generated funds and seasonal borrowings under our credit facilities 

  

the following table compares cashrelated information for the years ended january 29 2005 and january 31 2004 

  

   

the 328 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2004 was primarily due to increased profitability before noncash depreciation and amortization expense increased noncash depreciation expense was primarily attributed to our square footage growth in 2004 two new distribution centers in the current year and our continued installation of our pointofsale systems and other technology assets 

  

cash used in investing activities is generally expended to open new stores and to expand or relocate existing stores the 330 million increase in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily due to the following 

  

   

index to financial statements    

   

the 968 million change in cash provided by financing activities in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily the result of the following 

  

   

   

in march 2004 we entered into a fiveyear 4500 million revolving credit facility this facility bears interest at libor plus 0475 spread we used availability under this facility to repay 1426 million of variable rate debt related to our variable interest entity and to invest in certain shortterm securities as of january 29 2005 we had 2000 million available under this facility 

  

at january 29 2005 our longterm borrowings were 2690 million and our capital lease commitments were 127 million we also have a 1250 million letter of credit reimbursement and security agreement under which approximately 889 million was committed to letters of credit issued for routine purchases of imported merchandise 

  

in march 2005 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 3000 million of our common stock during the next three years this new authorization terminated the previous november 2002 authorization as of the termination date we had repurchased 5065495 shares for approximately 1420 million under the november 2002 authorization as of april 13 2005 we had repurchased 2048900 shares for approximately 556 million under the march 2005 authorization 

  

index to financial statements funding requirements 

  

overview 

  

in 2004 the average investment per new store including capital expenditures initial inventory and preopening costs was approximately 469000 we expect our cash needs for opening new stores and expanding existing stores in fiscal 2005 to total approximately 1386 million which includes capital expenditures and initial inventory and preopening costs our estimated capital expenditures for fiscal 2005 are between 1250 and 1400 million including planned expenditures for new and expanded stores and investments in technology we believe that we can adequately fund our working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures for the next few years from net cash provided by operations and borrowings under our existing credit facilities 

  

the following tables summarize our material contractual obligations including both on and offbalance sheet arrangements and our commitments in millions 

  

   

   

lease financing 

  

operating lease obligations our operating lease obligations are primarily for payments under noncancelable store leases the commitment includes amounts for leases that were signed prior to january 29 2005 for stores that were not yet open on january 29 2005 

  

capital lease obligations primarily saleleaseback  in september 1999 we sold certain retail store leasehold improvements to an unrelated third party and leased them back for seven years as a result of the transaction we received net cash of 209 million and an 81 million 110 note receivable which matures in october 2005 in 2004 we exercised the right to repurchase the leasehold improvements at october 31 2005 in order to exercise this right our lease obligation related to these improvements increased by 02 million the total amount of the lease obligation at january 29 2005 was 117 million the obligation and the note receivable will both be satisfied at the buyout date of october 31 2005 

  

longterm borrowings 

  

revolving credit facility in march 2004 we entered into a fiveyear revolving credit facility the facility the facility provides for a 4500 million line of credit including up to 500 million in available letters of credit bearing interest at libor plus 0475 the facility among other things requires the maintenance of certain specified financial ratios restricts the payment of certain distributions and prohibits the incurrence of certain new indebtedness we used availability under this facility to repay the 1426 million of variablerate debt and to purchase shortterm investments as of january 29 2005 we had 2500 million outstanding on this facility 

  

index to financial statements revenue bond financing  in may 1998 we entered into an agreement with the mississippi business finance corporation under which it issued 190 million of variablerate demand revenue bonds we borrowed the proceeds from the bonds to finance the acquisition construction and installation of land buildings machinery and equipment for our distribution facility in olive branch mississippi at january 29 2005 the balance outstanding on the bonds was 190 million we begin repayment of the principal amount of the bonds in june 2006 with a portion maturing each june 1 until the final portion matures in june 2018 the bonds do not have a prepayment penalty as long as the interest rate remains variable the bonds contain a demand provision and therefore outstanding amounts are classified as current liabilities we pay interest monthly based on a variable interest rate which was 257 at january 29 2005 the bonds are secured by a 193 million letter of credit issued by one of our existing lending banks the letter of credit is renewable annually the letter of credit and reimbursement agreement requires that we maintain specified financial ratios and restricts our ability to pay cash dividends 

  

commitments 

  

letters of credit and surety bonds  effective march 12 2001 we entered into a letter of credit reimbursement and security agreement which provides 1250 million for letters of credit which are generally issued for the routine purchase of imported merchandise approximately 889 million was committed to letters of credit at january 29 2005 we also have letters of credit or surety bonds outstanding for our revenue bond financing our insurance programs and certain utility payment obligations at some of our stores 

  

freight contracts we have contracted outbound freight services from various carriers with contracts expiring through january 2007 the total amount of these commitments is approximately 355 million 

  

technology assets we have commitments totaling approximately 58 million to primarily purchase store technology assets for our stores during 2005 

  

derivative financial instruments 

  

we are party to two interest rate swaps which allow us to manage the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations on the demand revenue bonds and a portion of our revolving credit facility the swaps are based on notional amounts of 190 million and 250 million under the 190 million agreement as amended we pay interest to the bank that provided the swap at a fixed rate in exchange the financial institution pays us at a variableinterest rate which is similar to the rate on the demand revenue bonds the variableinterest rate on the interest rate swap is set monthly no payments are made by either party under the swap for monthly periods with an established interest rate greater than a predetermined rate the knockout rate the swap may be canceled by the bank or us and settled for the fair value of the swap as determined by market rates 

  

the 250 million interest rate swap agreement is used to manage the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations on a portion of our revolving credit facility under this agreement we pay interest to a financial institution at a fixed rate of 543 in exchange the financial institution pays us at a variableinterest rate which approximates the floating rate on the debt excluding the credit spread the interest rate on the swap is subject to adjustment monthly the swap is effective through march 2006 but it may be canceled by the bank or us and settled for the fair value of the swap as determined by market rates 

  

because of the knockout provision in the 190 million swap changes in the fair value of that swap are recorded in earnings changes in fair value on our 250 million interest rate swap are recorded as a component of “accumulated other comprehensive income” in the consolidated balance sheets because the swap qualifies for hedge accounting treatment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 133 as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 138 the amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income are subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the related interest affects earnings

index to financial statements critical accounting policies 

  

the preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates certain of our estimates require a high level of judgment and have the potential to have a material effect on the financial statements if actual results vary significantly from those estimates following is a discussion of the estimates that we consider critical 

  

inventory valuation 

  

as discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weightedaverage basis cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weightedaverage basis under the retail inventory method the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated costtoretail ratio to the retail value of inventories the retail inventory method is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis 

  

inventory valuation methods require certain significant management estimates and judgments including estimates of merchandise markdowns and shrink which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins the averaging required in applying the retail inventory method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns could under certain circumstances result in costs not being recorded in the proper period 

  

we estimate our markdown reserve based on the consideration of a variety of factors including but not limited to quantities of slow moving or carryover seasonal merchandise on hand historical markdown statistics and future merchandising plans the accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors some of which are outside of our control including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends historically we have not experienced significant differences in our estimates of markdowns compared with actual results 

  

our accrual for shrink is based on the actual historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories adjusted if necessary for current economic conditions these estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger the majority of our counts are taken between january and may of each year therefore the shrink accrual recorded at january 29 2005 is based on estimated shrink for most of 2004 including the fourth quarter we have not experienced significant fluctuations in historical shrink rates in our dollar tree stores however we have sometimes experienced higher than typical shrink in acquired stores in the year following an acquisition we periodically adjust our shrink estimates to address these factors as they become apparent 

  

our management believes that our application of the retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market 

  

accrued expenses 

  

on a monthly basis we estimate certain material expenses in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred our most material estimates relate to domestic freight expenses related to our selfinsurance programs certain store level operating expenses such as property taxes and utilities and other expenses our freight and storelevel operating expenses are estimated based on current activity and historical results our workers’ compensation and general liability insurance accruals are recorded based on actuarial valuation methods which are adjusted annually based on a review performed by a thirdparty actuary these actuarial valuations are estimates based on historical loss development factors other expenses are estimated and recorded in the periods that management becomes aware of them the related accruals are adjusted as management’s estimates change differences in management’s estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual materially different from the calculated accrual our experience has been that some of our estimates are too high and others are too low historically the net total of these differences has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

  

income taxes 

  

on a quarterly basis we estimate our required tax liability and assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets our taxes payable are estimated based on enacted tax rates including estimated tax rates in states where our store base is growing applied to the income expected to be taxed currently the current tax liability includes a liability for resolution of tax uncertainties management assesses the realizability of our deferred tax assets based on the availability of carrybacks of future deductible amounts and 

  

index to financial statements management’s projections for future taxable income we cannot guarantee that we will generate income in future years historically we have not experienced significant differences in our estimates of our tax accrual however in 2004 we recognized a one time tax benefit related to the resolution of a tax uncertainty 

  

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations 

  

we experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales comparable store net sales operating income and net income and expect this trend to continue our results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

our highest sales periods are the christmas and easter seasons easter was observed on april 20 2003 april 11 2004 and will be observed on march 27 2005 due to the 16day shorter easter selling season in 2005 we expect a smaller portion of our annual earnings to be realized in the first quarter of 2005 as compared to 2004 we generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and a substantial majority of our operating and net income during the fourth quarter in anticipation of increased sales activity during these months we purchase substantial amounts of inventory and hire a significant number of temporary employees to supplement our continuing store staff our operating results particularly operating and net income could suffer if our net sales were below seasonal norms during the fourth quarter or during the easter season for any reason including merchandise delivery delays due to receiving or distribution problems or consumer sentiment 

  

our unaudited results of operations for the eight most recent quarters are shown in a table in footnote 13 of the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

  

inflation and other economic factors 

  

our ability to provide quality merchandise at a fixed price and on a profitable basis may be subject to economic factors and influences that we cannot control consumer spending could decline because of economic pressures including rising gas prices reductions in consumer confidence and spending could have an adverse effect on our sales national or international events including war or terrorism could lead to disruptions in economies in the united states or in foreign countries where we purchase some of our merchandise these and other factors could increase our merchandise costs and other costs that are critical to our operations such as shipping and wage rates 

  

shipping costs  in the past we have experienced annual increases of as much as 33 in our transpacific shipping rates due primarily to rate increases imposed by the transpacific shipping cartel currently transpacific shipping rates are negotiated with individual freight lines and are subject to fluctuation based on supply and demand for containers and current fuel costs we imported 19612 fortyfoot equivalent containers in 2004 and expect this number to increase in fiscal 2005 proportionately to sales growth as a result our transpacific shipping costs in fiscal 2005 may increase compared with fiscal 2004 when we renegotiate our import shipping rates effective may 2005 we can give no assurances as to the amount of the increase as we are in the early stages of our negotiations 

  

because of the increase in fuel costs throughout 2004 and the threat of continued increases in 2005 we expect increased fuel surcharges from our domestic contract carriers compared with past years based on current fuel prices we estimate that the costs resulting from increased fuel surcharges may approximate 40 to 50 million in 2005 we expect to offset a portion of this potential increase with improved operational efficiencies including improved routing and reduced distance between distribution centers and the stores that they service 

  

minimum wage although our average hourly wage rate is significantly higher than the federal minimum wage an increase in the mandated minimum wage could significantly increase our payroll costs in prior years proposals increasing the federal minimum wage by 100 per hour have narrowly failed to pass both houses of congress however if the federal minimum wage were to 

  

index to financial statements increase by 100 per hour we believe that our annual payroll expenses would increase by approximately 40 basis points unless we realize offsetting cost reductions 

  

leases for replaced distribution centers we are liable for rent and passthrough costs under two leases for nowclosed distribution centers whose leases expire in june 2005 and september 2005 we have recorded charges to settle these estimated future obligations 

  

unless offsetting cost savings are realized adverse economic factors including inflation in operating costs could harm our financial condition and results of operations 

  

new accounting pronouncements 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment sfas 123r this statement is a revision of sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation  and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees  sfas 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values under the provisions of this statement we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing sharebased payments the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at the date of adoption the transition alternatives include retrospective and prospective adoption methods under the retrospective method prior periods may be restated based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas no 123 for purposes of pro forma disclosures see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements either for all periods presented or as of the beginning of the year of adoption 

  

the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recognized beginning with the effective date based on the requirements of this statement for all sharebased payments granted after the effective date and based on the requirements of sfas no 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of this statement that remain unvested on the effective date 

  

the provisions of this statement are effective for fiscal 2006 and we are currently evaluating the requirements of this revision and have not determined our method of adoption

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of our business including the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency rate fluctuations we may enter into interest rate swaps to manage exposure to interest rate changes and we may employ other risk management strategies including the use of foreign currency forward contracts we do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging purposes and we do not hold derivative instruments for trading purposes 

  

interest rate risk 

  

we use variablerate debt to finance certain of our operations and capital improvements these obligations expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates if interest rates increase interest expense increases conversely if interest rates decrease interest expense also decreases we believe it is beneficial to limit the variability of our interest payments 

  

to meet this objective we entered into derivative instruments in the form of interest rate swaps to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in the variableinterest rates on the obligations the interest rate swaps reduce the interest rate exposure on these variablerate obligations under the interest rate swap we pay the bank at a fixedrate and receive variableinterest at a rate approximating the variablerate on the obligation thereby creating the economic equivalent of a fixedrate obligation under the 190 million interest rate swap no payments are made by parties under the swap for monthly periods in which the variableinterest rate is greater than the predetermined knockout rate 

  

the following table summarizes the financial terms of our interest rate swap agreements and the fair value of each interest rate swap at january 29 2005 

  

   

hypothetically a 1 change in interest rates results in approximately a 04 million change in the amount paid or received under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements on an annual basis due to many factors management is not able to predict the changes in fair value of our interest rate swaps the fair values are the estimated amounts we would pay or receive to terminate the agreements as of the reporting date these fair values are obtained from an outside financial institution

item 1  business

overview
     since our founding in 1986 we have become the leading operator of discount
variety stores offering merchandise at the fixed price of 100 we believe the
variety and quality of products we sell for 100 sets us apart from our
competitors at january 31 2004 we operated 2513 singleprice point stores
under the names of dollar tree greenbacks dollar express dollar bills only
one dollar and only one

     since 1986 we have evolved from opening primarily mallbased stores
ranging between 1500 and 2500 selling square feet to opening primarily strip
shopping centerbased stores averaging 10000 to 15000 selling square feet in
the past five years we gradually increased the average size of our stores as we
improved our merchandise offerings and service to our customers at december 31
1998 we operated 1285 stores in 31 states at january 31 2004 we operated
2513 stores in 47 states over the same time period our selling square footage
increased from approximately 49 million square feet in december 1998 to 169
million square feet in january 2004 our store growth since 1998 has resulted
from opening new stores and completing mergers and acquisitions we centrally
manage our store and distribution operations from our corporate headquarters in
chesapeake virginia

change in fiscal year end
     in january 2003 we changed our fiscal year end to a retail fiscal year
ending on the saturday closest to january 31

business strategy
     value merchandise offering we strive to exceed our customers expectations
of the variety and quality of products that they can purchase for 100 by
offering items that we believe typically sell for higher prices elsewhere we
buy approximately 60 of our merchandise domestically and directly import the
remaining 40 our domestic purchases include closeouts we believe our mix of
imported and domestic merchandise affords our buyers flexibility that allows
them to consistently exceed the customers expectation in addition direct
relationships with manufacturers permit us to select from a broad range of
products and customize packaging product sizes and package quantities that
meet our customers needs

     mix of basic variety and seasonal merchandise we maintain a balanced
selection of products within traditional variety store categories we offer a
wide selection of everyday basic products and we supplement these basic
everyday items with seasonal and closeout merchandise we attempt to keep
certain basic consumable merchandise in our stores continuously to establish our
stores as a destination closeout merchandise is purchased opportunistically and
represents less than 10 of our purchases national regional and privatelabel
brands have become a bigger part of our merchandise mix

     our merchandise mix consists of

    o  consumable merchandise which includes candy and food health and beauty
       care and housewares such as paper plastics and household chemicals

    o  variety merchandise which includes toys durable housewares gifts
       party goods greeting cards hardware and other items and

    o  seasonal goods such as easter summer toys lawn and garden halloween
       and christmas merchandise

     our larger stores which appeal to a broader demographic mix carry more
consumable merchandise than smaller stores as a result consumable merchandise
has grown as a percentage of purchases and sales our larger stores also allow
us to increase our seasonal offering and presentation resulting in increasing
our seasonal purchases as a percentage of our total purchases the following
table shows the percentage of purchases of each major product group for the
years ended january 31 2004 and december 31 2002

     convenient locations and store size we primarily focus on opening new
stores in strip shopping centers anchored by mass merchandisers whose target
customers we believe to be similar to ours and in neighborhood centers anchored
by large grocery retailers our stores have proven successful in

metropolitan areas midsized cities and small towns the range of our store
sizes allows us to target a particular location with a store that best suits
that market and takes advantage of available real estate opportunities our
stores are attractively designed and create an inviting atmosphere for shoppers
by using bright lighting vibrant colors uniform decorative signs and
background music we enhance the store design with attractive merchandise
displays we believe this design attracts new and repeat customers and enhances
our image as both a destination and impulse store

     profitable stores with strong cash flow we maintain a disciplined
costsensitive approach to store site selection in order to minimize the initial
capital investment required and maximize our potential to generate high
operating margins and strong cash flows we believe that our stores have a
relatively small shopping radius which allows us to profitably concentrate
multiple stores in a single market our ability to open new stores is dependent
upon among other factors locating suitable sites and negotiating favorable
lease terms

     on a cash basis our stores have historically experienced a payback period
of approximately 12 to 15 months and we expect this trend to continue following
is a reconciliation of our operating income margin as determined under
generally accepted accounting principles to the storelevel cash operating
income margin for all stores combined

during the past five years we have maintained our storelevel cash operating
income margins in the 223 to 242 range storelevel cash operating income
margin represents the operating results of our stores based on revenues and
costs that are directly associated with the individual stores excluding
depreciation this measure excludes several components of our corporate
operating margin as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles because these components are not directly associated with or
allocable to the individual stores management believes that this measure is
important in evaluating our performance because the measure is used by
management and investors to evaluate the performance of the stores in relation
to one another and in relation to industry peers and benchmarks stores whose
first full year of operations was 2003 had average storelevel cash operating
income margin of approximately 225 which was slightly lower than the 227
average for all stores with a full years operations in fiscal 2003

     our older smaller stores continue to generate significant storelevel
operating income and operating cash flows and have some of the highest operating
margins among our stores however the increased size of our newer stores allows
us to offer a wider selection of products including more basic consumable
merchandise thereby making them more attractive as a destination store

     the strong cash flows generated by our stores allow us to grow primarily
using internally generated funds over the past five years cash flows from
operating activities have exceeded capital expenditures

discussion and analysis  results of operations on page 15 for more
information on seasonality of sales see managements discussion and analysis

     cost control we believe that substantial buying power at the 100 price
point contributes to our successful purchasing strategy which includes
disciplined targeted merchandise margin goals by category we believe our
disciplined buying and quality merchandise help to minimize markdowns we buy
products on an orderbyorder basis and have no material longterm purchase
contracts or other assurances of continued product supply or guaranteed product
cost no vendor accounted for more than 10 of total merchandise purchased in
any of the past five years

     during 2002 we upgraded our supply chain systems and identified other
processes that could be improved using technology these new systems continue to
provide us with valuable sales information to assist our buyers and improve
merchandise allocation to our stores controlling our inventory levels will
result in more efficient distribution and store operations

     payroll and related costs are a significant component of our selling
general and administrative costs accordingly we believe that more efficient
use of labor hours in our stores could increase our profitability in an effort
to optimize hours worked in our stores we expect to roll out a new labor
management and scheduling system during fiscal 2004


                                       6
page

     information systems we believe that investments in appropriate technology
help us to increase sales and control costs in 2002 we implemented a new
inventory management system our new system has allowed us to improve the
efficiency of our supply chain improve merchandise flow and control
distribution and store operating costs

     in 2003 we piloted our automatic replenishment system this system
automatically reorders key items based on actual store level sales in 2004 we
expect to roll out this system to additional stores and merchandise categories

     at january 31 2004 we operated pointofsale systems in 1855 stores and
we expect to install pointofsale systems in virtually all remaining stores
that will benefit from it by the end of fiscal 2004 pointofsale data allows
us to track sales by merchandise category and geographic region as well as
assists in planning for future purchases of inventory we believe that this
information will allow us to ship the appropriate product to the correct store
at the proper time

     corporate culture and values we believe that honesty and integrity doing
the right things for the right reasons and treating people fairly and with
respect are core values within our corporate culture we believe that running a
business and certainly a public company carries with it a responsibility to be
beyond reproach when making operational and financial decisions our management
team visits and shops our stores like every customer we have an open door
policy to all our associates and ideas and individuality are encouraged we
have standards for store displays merchandise presentation and store
operations our distribution centers are operated based on objective measures of
performance and everyone in our store support center is available to help
associates in the stores and distribution centers get their jobs done

     our disclosure committee headed by our corporate controller meets at
least quarterly and identifies and monitors our internal financial reporting
controls and ensures that our public filings contain discussions about the risks
our business faces we believe that we have the controls in place to be able to
certify our financial statements additionally we have complied with the
updated listing requirements for the nasdaq stock market

growth strategy
     store openings and square footage growth the primary factors contributing
to our net sales growth have been new store openings an active store expansion
and remodel program and selective mergers and acquisitions from 1999 to 2003
net sales increased at a compound annual growth rate of 200 and operating
income increased at a compound annual growth rate of 136 we expect that the
substantial majority of our future sales growth will come primarily from new
store openings and secondarily from our store expansion and remodeling program

     the following table shows the total selling square footage of our stores
and the selling square footage per new store opened over the last five years we
began opening larger stores after the acquisition of 98 cent clearance center in
1998 our growth and productivity statistics will be reported based on selling
square footage prospectively because our management believes the use of selling
square footage yields a more accurate measure of store productivity the selling
square footage statistics for 1999 through 2000 are estimates based on the
relationship of selling to gross square footage
                                                                average selling

     we expect to increase our selling square footage in the future by opening
new stores in underserved markets and strategically increasing our presence in
our existing markets via new store openings and store expansions expansions
include store relocations in fiscal 2004 and beyond we plan to predominantly
open stores that are approximately 10000 to 15000 selling square feet and we
believe this size range allows us to achieve our objectives in the markets in
which we plan to expand at january 31 2004 356 of our stores totaling 283
of our selling square footage were 10000 selling square feet or larger

     in addition to new store openings we plan to continue our store expansion
program to increase our net sales per store and take advantage of market
opportunities we target stores for expansion based on the current sales per
selling square foot and changes in market opportunities stores targeted for
expansion are generally less than 4000 selling square feet in size store
expansions generally increase the existing store size by approximately 6000 to
10000 selling square feet

     since 1995 we have added a total of 471 stores through four mergers and
several small acquisitions our acquisition strategy has been to target
companies with a similar single price point concept that have shown success in
operations or provide a strategic advantage we evaluate potential acquisition
opportunities in our retail sector as they become available

     merchandising and distribution expanding our customer base is important to
our growth plans we plan to continue to stock our new stores with the
everchanging merchandise that our current customers have come to appreciate in
addition we are opening larger stores that contain more basic consumable
merchandise to attract new customers consumable merchandise typically leads to
more frequent return trips to our stores resulting in increased sales the
presentation and display of merchandise in our stores are critical to
communicating value to our customers and creating a more exciting shopping
experience we believe our approach to visual merchandising results in high
store traffic high sales volume and an environment that encourages impulse
purchases

     a strong and efficient distribution network is key to our ability to grow
and to maintain a lowcost operating structure we currently operate nine
distribution centers and plan to open a replacement distribution center for our
chicago distribution center in midyear 2004 these distribution centers in
total will be capable of supporting approximately 45 billion in annual sales
we expect to continue to add distribution capacity to support our store opening
plans with the aim of remaining approximately one year ahead of our
distribution needs new distribution sites are strategically located to reduce
stem miles maintain flexibility and improve efficiency in our store service
areas

     our stores receive approximately 96 of their inventory from our
distribution centers via contract carriers the remaining store inventory
primarily perishable consumable items and other vendormaintained display items
are delivered directly to our stores from vendors for more information on our
distribution center network see properties below

competition
     the retail industry is highly competitive and we expect competition to
increase in the future the value discount retail sector currently represents
approximately 10 of the 300 billion discount retail market and appears to be
the fastest growing sector our value discount retail competitors include family
dollar dollar general 99 cents only and big lots the principal methods of
competition include convenience and the quality of merchandise offered to the
customer though we are a fixedprice point retailer we also compete with mass
merchandisers such as walmart and target and regional discount retailers in
addition several mass merchandisers and grocery store chains are now testing
dollar store concepts in their stores which will increase competition our
sales and profits could be reduced by increases in competition especially
because there are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our
retail sector

trademarks
     we are the owners of federal service mark registrations for dollar tree
the dollar tree logo 1 dollar tree together with the related design and
one priceone dollar a small number of our stores operate under the name
only one dollar for which we have not obtained a service mark registration
we also own a concurrent use registration for dollar bill and the related
logo during 1997 we acquired the rights to use trade names previously owned by
everythings a dollar a former competitor in the 100 price point industry
several trade names were included in the purchase including the marks
everythings 100 we mean everything and everythings 100 the
registration of which is pending with the acquisition of dollar express we
became the owner of the service marks dollar express and dollar expres we
became the owners of the greenbacks all a dollar and all a dollar service
marks with the acquisition of greenbacks we have applied for federal trademark
registrations for various private labels that we use to market some of our
product lines

employees
     we employed approximately 9600 fulltime and 19100 parttime associates
on january 31 2004 the number of parttime associates fluctuates depending on
seasonal needs we consider our relationship with our associates to be good and
we have not experienced significant interruptions of operations due to labor
disagreements none of our employees is subject to collective bargaining
agreements

     we currently lease our stores and expect to continue to lease new stores as
we expand our leases typically provide for a short initial lease term
generally five years with options to extend we believe this leasing strategy
enhances our flexibility to pursue various expansion opportunities resulting
from changing market conditions

     as current leases expire we believe that we will be able to obtain lease
renewals if desired for present store locations or to obtain leases for
equivalent or better locations in the same general area to date we have not
experienced significant difficulty in either renewing leases for existing
locations or securing leases for suitable locations for new stores from time to
time we may not comply with certain provisions of our store operating leases we
maintain good relations with our landlords and believe that violation of these
lease provisions if any will not have a material effect on our operations

distribution centers
     the following table includes information about the distribution centers
that we currently operate by midyear 2004 we are planning to replace our
chicago distribution center with a newly constructed automated 12 million
square foot distribution center located in joliet illinois once our joliet
facility is operational we believe our distribution center network will be
capable of supporting a total of approximately 45 billion in annual sales

     in february 2004 we opened our newly built distribution center in
ridgefield washington this distribution center is a 665000 square foot
facility that can be expanded in the future to accommodate our growth needs in
addition to our distribution centers noted above during the past several years
we have used offsite facilities to accommodate limited quantities of seasonal
merchandise

     four of our distribution centers were financed through a variable interest
entity which we included in our consolidated financial statements effective
january 1 2003 the variable interest entity owned these distribution center
assets and carried the debt used to finance them terms of the debt among other
things required the maintenance of certain specified financial ratios
restricted the payment of certain distributions and limited certain types of
debt we could incur in march 2004 we refinanced the debt related to the
variable interest entity see note 14 in the notes to consolidated financial
statements on page 50

     with the exception of our chicago salt lake city and ridgefield
facilities each of our distribution centers contains advanced materials

     we have a former distribution center for which we are liable for future
rents the lease on this facility expires in september 2005 we will continue to
make every effort to sublease this facility the lease on our chicago
distribution center expires in june 2005 we are making an effort to find a
tenant to sublease the facility when we vacate it later this year to move to our
new facility in joliet however if we are unable to locate a suitable tenant
we would have to record a charge for our future obligations under this lease of
approximately 10 million

    o  personal injury claims and

    o  the infringement of the intellectual property rights of others


     we have been sued in california by several employees and in alabama by a
salaried store manager and a former store manager who allege among other
things that they should have been classified as nonexempt employees and
therefore should have received overtime compensation the suits also request
that the california state court certify the case as a class action on behalf of
all store managers assistant managers and merchandise managers in our
california stores and request that the alabama federal court certify the case as
a collective action under the fair labor standards act on behalf of all salaried
managers in all of our stores we were also sued in california on november 3
2003 by a former store manager who alleges that certain employees should have

key events and recent developments
     several key events have had or are expected to have a significant effect on
our results of operations you should keep in mind that

    o  in march 2004 we entered into a fiveyear 4500 million revolving
       credit facility we used availability under this facility to repay the
       1426 million of variable rate debt related to our variable interest

       facility

    o  in january 2004 we completed construction on our ridgefield
       washington distribution center which is a 665000 square foot facility
       that can be expanded in the future to accommodate our growth needs we
       began shipping merchandise from this distribution center in february
       2004

    o  in june 2003 we completed our acquisition of greenbacks inc based
       in salt lake city utah greenbacks operated 100 stores in 10 western

overview
     our net sales are derived from the sale of merchandise two major factors
tend to affect our net sales trends first is our success at opening new stores
or adding new stores through mergers or acquisitions second sales vary at our
existing stores from one year to the next we refer to this change as a change
in comparable store net sales because we compare only those stores that are
open throughout both of the periods being compared we include sales from stores
expanded during the year in the calculation of comparable store net sales which
has the effect of increasing our comparable store net sales the term expanded
also includes stores that are relocated in fiscal 2003 we increased our
selling square footage by 275 of this 36 million selling square foot
increase approximately 09 million was added by expanding existing stores in
fiscal 2004 we plan to increase our selling square footage by approximately
20

     most retailers have the ability to increase their merchandise prices or
alter the mix of their merchandise to favor higherpriced items in order to
increase their comparable store net sales as a fixedprice point retailer we
do not have the ability to raise our prices generally our comparable store net
sales will increase only if we sell more merchandise

     we expect the substantial majority of our future net sales growth to come
from square footage growth resulting from new store openings and expansion of
existing stores we expect the average size of new stores opened in fiscal 2004
to be approximately 10000 selling square feet per store in fiscal 2004 and
beyond we plan to predominantly open stores that are approximately 10000 to
15000 selling square feet we believe this size range allows us to achieve our
objectives in the markets in which we plan to expand larger stores take longer
to negotiate build out and open and generally have lower net sales per square
foot than our smaller stores while our newer larger stores have lower sales
per square foot than older smaller stores they generate higher sales and
operating income per store and create an improved shopping environment that
invites customers to shop longer and buy more when our larger stores become the
majority of our store base which we expect to occur by the end of 2005 we
believe our net sales per square foot will begin to rise

     our plans for fiscal 2004 operations anticipate comparable store net sales
increases of slightly positive to 3 net sales in the 32 to 33 billion
range and earnings increases of at least 14 we continue to expect annual gross
margin as a percentage of net sales to be between 360 and 365 we also
expect to experience pressure on our gross profit margins in future years as we
refine our merchandise mix to include a higher proportion of consumable
merchandise which typically carries a lower gross profit margin open larger
stores and continue to absorb higher costs

     we must control our merchandise costs inventory levels and our general and
administrative expenses increases in these expenses could negatively impact our
operating results because we cannot pass on increased expenses to our customers
by increasing our merchandise price above the 100 price point

     we plan to continue to improve operating expenses other than depreciation
as a percentage of net sales however we expect our depreciation expense to
increase by more than 20 basis points in 2004 compared to 2003 as a result we
believe that maintaining our operating margin in 2004 will be a challenge
depreciation expense is expected to increase as a result of our continued
investments in opening larger stores and in technology assets such as
pointofsale systems particularly as we convert existing stores to
pointofsale as these assets become fully depreciated we expect a decrease in
our depreciation expense as a percentage of net sales beginning in 2006

     we expect a shift in the seasonality of our earnings in 2004 compared to
2003 we expect a smaller portion of our total annual earnings to be realized in
the first quarter of 2004 while we believe a larger portion will be realized in
the fourth quarter of 2004 this shift is primarily due to the nineday shorter
easter selling season and two additional selling days between thanksgiving and
christmas in 2004 compared to 2003

     net sales net sales increased 187 in 2003 compared to 2002 we attribute
this 4420 million increase in net sales primarily to new and acquired stores
in 2003 and 2002 which are not included in our comparable store net sales
calculation and to a comparable store net sales increase of 29 in 2003
comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated
stores which we include in the calculation and to a lesser extent are
negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing
stores our comparable store net sales increase was due to our expanded and
relocated stores net sales in our larger newer stores particularly the 10000
to 15000 square foot stores have been stronger than those in our smaller
older stores

     the following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store
size and count for fiscal years ended january 31 2004 and february 1 2003

of the 36 million selling square foot increase in 2003 approximately 09
million selling square feet was added by expanding existing stores

     gross profit gross profit margin was 362 in 2003 and 2002 an
approximate 20 basis point decrease in markdowns was offset by an approximate 20
basis point increase in occupancy costs our improved markdowns are primarily
due to better seasonal sellthrough use of pointofsale data to better manage
the buying process and better allocate merchandise across store classes through
use of our supply chain systems our increase in occupancy costs was primarily
attributed to the loss of leverage as a result of two fewer selling days in 2003
compared to 2002 and increased occupancy rates in our smaller stores which
generally experience lower comparable store net sales in addition during 2003
gross profit margin was affected by approximately 38 million of additional
noncash depreciation expense in cost of sales associated with the adoption of
fasb interpretation 46 consolidation of variable interest entities by adopting
fin 46 four of our distribution centers previously accounted for as operating
leases were consolidated in our financial statements effective january 1 2003

     selling general and administrative expenses selling general and
administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales remained unchanged at
257 in 2003 increased depreciation expense of approximately 50 basis points
was primarily offset by a decrease of approximately 40 basis points in
payrollrelated and store operating expenses the increase in depreciation
expense was associated with our larger new and expanded stores and the continued
installation of our pointofsale systems and other technology assets continued
improvements in storelevel labor productivity and store supply expenses were
the primary drivers to our lower payrollrelated and store operating expenses
as a percentage of net sales

     operating income due to the reasons discussed above operating income
margin was consistent at 105 for 2003 and 2002

     interest income and expense interest income as a percentage of net sales
was consistent at 01 in 2003 and 2002 interest expense increased 36 million
primarily due to the consolidation of our variable interest entity effective
january 1 2003

     income taxes  our effective tax rate was 385 in 2003 and 2002

     net sales net sales for the month ended february 1 2003 increased 217
compared to the month ended january 31 2002 this increase was primarily due to
increased sales in our new and expanded stores and one additional selling day in
the month ended february 1 2003 compared to the month ended january 31 2002
these increases were slightly offset by a 51 decrease in comparable store net
sales

     gross profit gross profit margin decreased 160 basis points in the month
ended february 1 2003 compared to the month ended january 31 2002 primarily
due to a change in our merchandise mix toward lower margin merchandise

     selling general and administrative expenses selling general and
administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 23 primarily
as a result of a 100 basis point increase in payrollrelated costs and a 40
basis point increase in depreciation costs

     cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle the cumulative
effect of a change in accounting principle represents net of tax the effect of
consolidation of our variable interest entity in accordance with the
implementation of fin 46 effective january 1 2003 the variable interest entity
holds the assets and related debt of four of our distribution centers

calendar year 2002 compared to calendar year 2001
     net sales net sales increased 172 in 2002 compared to 2001 we attribute
this 3419 million increase in net sales primarily to our new stores opened in
2002 and 2001 which are not included in our comparable store net sales increase
and to a comparable store net sales increase of 10 in 2002 comparable store
net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores which we
include in the calculation and to a lesser extent are negatively affected
when we open new stores or expand stores near existing stores

     we opened 318 new stores and closed 30 stores during 2002 compared to 276
new stores opened and 30 stores closed in 2001 during 2002 we opened larger
stores than originally planned which required us to shift our store openings to
later in the third quarter and shift some store openings into the fourth
quarter we added 288 to our selling square footage in 2002 compared to 296
in 2001 of the 29 million in selling square footage increase in 2002
approximately 05 million selling square feet was added by expanding 111
existing stores

     gross profit gross profit margin increased to 364 in 2002 compared to
360 in 2001 this increase in gross profit margin in 2002 was primarily due to
a 50 basis point improvement in inventory shrink this improvement is primarily
attributed to lower shrink in our dollar express stores and our philadelphia
distribution network and adjustments to our distribution center shrink in
connection with our supply chain management system implementation in addition
merchandise costs increased 50 basis points but this increase was offset by a
50 basis point improvement in freight costs the increase in our merchandise
costs resulted from a change in our merchandise mix toward lower margin
merchandise as we increased the sales of these items in our newer larger
stores negotiation of favorable import and domestic freight rates coupled with
better management of routing of our merchandise shipments during 2002 compared
to 2001 led to the improvements in our freight costs

     selling general and administrative expenses selling general and
administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales to 255 compared
to 257 in 2001 this decrease is primarily the result of savings achieved from
our implementation of various expensemanagement initiatives particularly with
regard to payrollrelated expenses partially offset by an increase in
depreciation and amortization expense our payrollrelated expenses decreased 60
basis points in 2002 compared to 2001 while our depreciation and amortization
increased 30 basis points for the same period the increase in depreciation
expense resulted primarily from increased depreciation costs associated with our
square footage growth and increased depreciation costs resulting from the
continued rollout of our pointofsale systems in addition effective january
1 2002 we ceased amortization of goodwill in accordance with the provisions of
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 142 goodwill and other
intangible assets we recorded approximately 20 million of goodwill
amortization in 2001

     operating income  due to the reasons discussed above operating income
increased to 2539 million in 2002 from 2039 million in 2001 and increased
as a percentage of net sales to 109 from 103

     interest income and expense interest income in 2002 was consistent with
2001 decreased interest rates throughout 2002 were offset by increased levels
of cash and cash equivalents interest expense decreased 09 million in 2002
compared to 2001 due to repayments of our longterm debt and a decrease in
interest on our capitalized leases we benefited slightly from the decrease in
variable interest rates in 2002 however this benefit was partially offset as a
result of the interest rate swaps in effect during 2002

     income taxes  our effective tax rate was 385 in 2002 and 2001

liquidity and capital resources
     our business requires capital to open new stores expand our distribution
network and operate existing stores our working capital requirements for
existing stores are seasonal and usually reach their peak in september and
october historically we have satisfied our seasonal working capital
requirements for existing stores and have funded our store opening and expansion
programs from internally generated funds and seasonal borrowings under our
credit facilities

     financing activities    355          225         18

     the 274 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2003
was due primarily to increased profitability before noncash depreciation and
amortization expense noncash depreciation expense was primarily attributed to
our square footage growth in 2003 and our continued installation of our point
ofsale systems and other technology assets these increases were  partially
offset by the timing and volume of domestic merchandise receipts in  january
2004 compared to december 2002 our outstanding payable days were approximately
30 days in both periods

     cash used in investing activities is generally expended to open new stores
and to expand or relocate existing stores the 936 million increase in 2003
compared to 2002 was primarily due to the following

    o  we acquired greenbacks for approximately 100 million

    o  we internally financed the construction of our distribution centers in
       2003 and

                                       18
page

    o  we increased the number of pointofsale installations as well as
       invested in additional technology assets

these increases were partially offset by 635 million in proceeds from net
sales of our shortterm investments

     the 580 million increase in cash used in financing activities in fiscal
year 2003 compared with calendar year 2002 was primarily the result of the
following

    o  we paid approximately 380 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 to
       repurchase shares under a 200 million authorization granted by our
       board of directors in november 2002

    o  we received 103 million less cash pursuant to stockbased
       compensation plans in 2003 compared to 2002 because of a decrease
       in the amount of stock option exercises which we believe resulted
       from the decreased stock price in 2003 compared to 2002

     at january 31 2004 our longterm borrowings were 1676 million and our
capital lease commitments were 203 million we had 1500 million available
through a revolving credit facility we also have a 1250 million letter of
credit reimbursement and security agreement under which approximately 670
million was committed to letters of credit issued for routine purchases of
imported merchandise

     in march 2004 we entered into a fiveyear 4500 million revolving credit
facility this facility bears interest at libor plus 0475 spread we used
availability under this facility to repay 1426 million of variable rate debt
related to our variable interest entity and to invest in certain money market
securities as of april 1 2004 we had 2000 million available under this
facility this facility replaced the 1500 million revolving credit facility

funding requirements
overview
     in 2003 the average investment per new store including capital
expenditures initial inventory and preopening costs was approximately
442000 we expect our cash needs for opening new stores and expanding existing
stores in fiscal 2004 to total approximately 1780 million which includes
approximately 1295 million for capital expenditures and 485 million for
initial inventory and preopening costs our total planned capital expenditures
for fiscal 2004 are approximately 1990 million including planned expenditures
for new and expanded stores new and relocated distribution centers and
investments in technology we believe that we can adequately fund our working
capital requirements and planned capital expenditures for the next few years
from net cash provided by operations and borrowings under our existing credit
facilities including the new facility entered into in march 2004 we believe
that we will be able to obtain adequate funding to construct our new
distribution centers

lease financing
     operating lease obligations amounts presented are as of december 31 2003
for leases signed prior to that date in addition amounts presented have been
updated for new leases entered into during the month of january 2004 our
operating lease obligations are primarily for payments under noncancelable store
leases the commitment includes amounts for leases that were signed prior to
january 31 2004 for stores that were not yet open on january 31 2004

     capital lease obligations primarily saleleaseback in september 1999 we
sold certain retail store leasehold improvements to an unrelated third party and
leased them back for seven years we have an option to repurchase the leasehold
improvements in september 2004 and september 2006 at amounts approximating their
fair market values at the time the option is exercised the transaction is
treated as a financing arrangement for financial accounting purposes the total
amount of the lease obligation is 234 million we are required to make monthly
lease payments of 438000 in the first five years and 638000 in the sixth and
seventh years as a result of the transaction we received net cash of 209
million and an 81 million 110 note receivable which matures in september
2006 the amount of the repurchase option under the lease will equal the amount
outstanding under the note receivable in september 2006

longterm borrowings
     variable interest entity in march 2001 we entered into an operating
lease known as a synthetic lease to finance the construction of several of our
distribution centers at december 31 2002 approximately 1545 million of the
1650 million facility was committed to the stockton savannah briar creek and
marietta facilities because we accounted for this transaction as an operating
lease prior to january 1 2003 the related fixed assets and lease liabilities
were not included in our balance sheets and payments under the lease were
included in rent expense prior to this date

     in january 2003 the financial accounting standards board issued fasb
interpretation no 46 after evaluating this new standard our board of
directors and management determined that we would maintain the existing terms of
the facility and include the variable interest entity in our consolidated
financial statements effective january 1 2003 as a result of the
implementation the distribution center assets the financingrelated costs and
the debt incurred by the variable interest entity to purchase and construct the
assets are included on our balance sheets for periods after january 1 2003
interest is payable monthly and the principal amount is payable upon maturity of
the debt in march 2006 the debt among other things requires the maintenance
of certain specified financial ratios restricts the payment of certain
distributions and prohibits the incurrence of certain new indebtedness

     in march 2004 we repaid this debt with borrowings from the 4500 million
revolving credit facility

     for more information on the variable interest entity see notes 6 and 14 of
the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k

     revenue bond financing in may 1998 we entered into an agreement with the
mississippi business finance corporation under which it issued 190 million of
variablerate demand revenue bonds we borrowed the proceeds from the bonds to
finance the acquisition construction and installation of land buildings
machinery and equipment for our distribution facility in olive branch
mississippi at january 31 2004 the balance outstanding on the bonds was 190
million we begin repayment of the principal amount of the bonds in june 2006
with a portion maturing each june 1 until the final portion matures in june
2018 the bonds do not have a prepayment penalty as long as the interest rate
remains variable the bonds contain a demand provision and therefore
outstanding amounts are classified as current liabilities we pay interest
monthly based on a variable interest rate which was 112 at january 31 2004
the bonds are secured by a 193 million letter of credit issued by one of our
existing lending banks the letter of credit is renewable annually the letter
of credit and reimbursement agreement requires that we maintain specified
financial ratios and restricts our ability to pay cash dividends

     debt securities in april 1997 we issued 300 million of 729 unsecured
senior notes proceeds from which indirectly financed a portion of our
chesapeake distribution center and corporate headquarters we pay interest on
the notes semiannually on april 30 and october 30 each

                                       20

year and we have been paying principal in equal annual installments of 60
million since april 30 2000 we will make the final payment on april 30 2004
the note holders have the right to require us to prepay the notes in full
without premium upon a change of control or upon specified asset dispositions
or other transactions we may make the note agreements prohibit specified
mergers and consolidations in which our company is not the surviving company
require that we maintain specified financial ratios require that the notes
rank on par with other debt and limit the amount of debt we can incur in the
event of default or a prepayment at our option we must pay a penalty to the
note holder

commitments
     unsecured revolving credit facility effective may 30 2003 we
entered into a 1500 million revolving credit facility this facility bears
interest at libor plus a spread the revolving credit facility among other
things requires the maintenance of certain distributions and prohibits the
incurrence of certain new indebtedness there was no amount outstanding on this
facility at january 31 2004

     see a discussion of our new 4500 million credit facility entered into in
march 2004 in liquidity and capital resources on page 18

     letters of credit and bonds effective march 12 2001 we entered into a
letter of credit reimbursement and security agreement which provides 1250
million for letters of credit which are generally issued for the routine
purchase of imported merchandise approximately 670 million was committed to
letters of credit at january 31 2004 we also have letters of credit or surety
bonds outstanding for our revenue bond financing our highdeductible insurance
program and utility payments at our stores

     freight contracts we have contracted outbound freight services from
various carriers with contracts expiring through january 2007 the total amount
of these commitments is approximately 297 million

     technology assets we have commitments totaling approximately 241 million
to purchase store technology assets for our stores during 2004

derivative financial instruments
     we are party to four interest rate swaps which allow us to manage the risk
associated with interest rate fluctuations on the demand revenue bonds and a
portion of our variable rate variable interest entity debt the swaps are based
on notional amounts of 190 million 100 million 50 million and 250
million under the 190 million 100 million and 50 million agreements as
amended we pay interest to the banks that provided the swaps at a fixed rate
in exchange the financial institution pays us at variableinterest rates which
are similar to the rates on the demand revenue bonds and our variablerate
operating leases the variableinterest rates on the interest rate swaps are set
monthly no payments are made by either party under the swaps for monthly
periods with an established interest rate greater than a predetermined rate the
knockout rate the swaps may be canceled by the bank or us and settled for the
fair value of the swap as determined by market rates

     the 250 million interest rate swap agreement is used to manage the risk
associated with interest rate fluctuations on a portion of our variable interest
entity debt under this agreement we pay interest to a financial institution at
a fixed rate of 543 in exchange the financial institution pays us at a
variableinterest rate which approximates the floating rate on the debt
excluding the credit spread the interest rate on the swap is subject to
adjustment monthly the swap is effective through march 2006 but it may be
canceled by the bank or us and settled for the fair value of the swap as
determined by market rates

     because of the knockout provision in the 190 million 100 million and
50 million interest rate swaps changes in the fair value of those swaps are
recorded in earnings changes in fair value on our 250 million interest rate
swap are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in
the consolidated balance sheets because the swap qualifies for hedge accounting
treatment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no
133 as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 138 the
amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income are subsequently
reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the related interest
affects earnings

     in march 2004 we repaid the variable interest entity debt with borrowings
from our 4500 million revolving credit facility the 250 million 100
million and 50 million interest rate swaps designated to the variable interest
rate debt were redesignated to our borrowings under the 4500 million revolving
credit facility this redesignation does not effect the accounting method used

critical accounting policies
     the preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates
certain of our estimates require a high level of judgment and have the potential
to have a material effect on the financial statements if actual results vary
significantly from those estimates following is a discussion of the estimates
that we consider critical

inventory valuation
     as discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements
inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or
market with cost determined on a weightedaverage basis cost is assigned to
store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weightedaverage basis
under the retail inventory method the valuation of inventories at cost and the
resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated costtoretail
ratio to the retail value of inventories the retail inventory method is an
averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry and results in
valuing inventories at lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a
reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis

     inventory valuation methods require certain significant management
estimates and judgments including estimates of merchandise markdowns and
shrink which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as
well as the resulting gross margins the averaging required in applying the
retail inventory method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns could under
certain circumstances result in costs not being recorded in the proper period

     we estimate our markdown reserve based on the consideration of a variety of
factors including but not limited to quantities of slow moving or carryover
seasonal merchandise on hand historical markdown statistics and future
merchandising plans the accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many
factors some of which are outside of our control including changes in economic
conditions and consumer buying trends historically we have not experienced
significant differences in our estimates of markdowns compared with actual
results

     our accrual for shrink is based on the actual historical shrink results of
our most recent physical inventories adjusted if necessary for current
economic conditions these estimates are compared to actual results as physical
inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger the majority of
our counts are taken between january and may of each year therefore the shrink
accrual recorded at january 31 2004 is based on estimated shrink for most of
2003 including the fourth quarter we have not experienced significant
fluctuations in historical shrink rates in our dollar tree stores however we
have sometimes experienced higher than typical shrink in acquired stores in the
year following an acquisition as was experienced in the former dollar express
distribution facilities and stores in 2001 we periodically adjust our shrink
estimates to address these factors as they become apparent

     our management believes that our application of the retail inventory method
results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results
in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market

accrued expenses
     on a monthly basis we estimate certain material expenses in an effort to
record those expenses in the period incurred our most material estimates relate
to domestic freight insurancerelated expenses certain store level operating
expenses such as property taxes and utilities and other expenses our freight
and storelevel operating expenses are estimated based on current activity and
historical results our workers compensation and general liability insurance
accruals are recorded based on actuarial valuation methods performed by
thirdparty actuaries these actuarial valuations are estimates based on
historical loss development factors other expenses are estimated and recorded
in the periods that management becomes aware of them the related accruals are
adjusted as managements estimates change differences in managements estimates
and assumptions could result in an accrual materially different from the
calculated accrual our experience has been that some of our estimates are too
high and others are too low historically the net total of these differences
has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of
operations

income taxes
     on a quarterly basis we estimate our required tax liability and assess the
recoverability of our deferred tax assets our taxes payable are estimated based
on enacted tax rates including estimated tax rates in states where our store
base is growing applied to the income expected to be taxed currently management
assesses the realizability of our deferred tax assets based on the availability
of carrybacks of future deductible amounts and managements projections for
future taxable income we cannot guarantee that we will generate income in
future years historically we have not experienced significant differences in
our estimates of our tax accrual

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations
     we experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales comparable store net
sales operating income and net income and expect this trend to continue our
results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety
of factors including


                                       22
page

    o  shifts in the timing of certain holidays especially easter

    o  the timing of new store openings

    o  the net sales contributed by new stores

    o  changes in our merchandise mix and

    o  competition

     our highest sales periods are the christmas and easter seasons easter was
observed on march 31 2002 april 20 2003 and will be observed on april 11
2004 we generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and a
substantial majority of our operating and net income during the fourth quarter
in anticipation of increased sales activity during these months we purchase
substantial amounts of inventory and hire a significant number of temporary
employees to supplement our permanent store staff our operating results
particularly operating and net income could suffer if our net sales were below
seasonal norms during the fourth quarter or during the easter season for any
reason including merchandise delivery delays due to receiving or distribution
problems

     our unaudited results of operations for the eight most recent quarters are
shown in a table in footnote 13 of the consolidated financial statements in item
8 of this form 10k

inflation and other economic factors
     our ability to provide quality merchandise at a fixed price and on a
profitable basis may be subject to economic factors and influences that we
cannot control national or international events including war or terrorism
could lead to disruptions in economies in the united states or in foreign
countries where we purchase much of our merchandise these and other factors
could increase our merchandise costs and other costs that are critical to our
operations such as shipping and wage rates consumer spending could also
decline because of economic pressures

     shipping costs in the past we have experienced annual increases of as
much as 33 in our transpacific shipping rates due primarily to rate increases
imposed by the transpacific shipping cartel currently transpacific shipping
rates are negotiated with individual freight lines and are subject to
fluctuation based on supply and demand for containers and current fuel costs as
a result our transpacific shipping costs in fiscal 2004 may increase by 50
million or more compared with fiscal 2003 when we renegotiate our import
shipping rates effective may 2004 we can give no assurances as to the amount of
the increase as we are in the early stages of our negotiations

     because of rising fuel costs in 2004 we could experience increases in
mileage costs as charged by our domestic contract carriers compared with past
years however we do not expect these increases if any to have a material
effect on our results of operations in part because the opening of two new
distribution centers in 2004 is expected to reduce the average distance between
our distribution centers and the stores that they service

     minimum wage although our average hourly wage rate is significantly higher
than the federal minimum wage an increase in the mandated minimum wage could
significantly increase our payroll costs in prior years proposals increasing
the federal minimum wage by 100 per hour have narrowly failed to pass both
houses of congress however if the federal minimum wage were to increase by
100 per hour we believe that our annual payroll expenses would increase by
approximately 40 basis points unless we realize offsetting cost reductions

     leases for replaced distribution centers we are liable for rent and
passthrough costs under a lease for a nowclosed distribution center whose
lease expires in september 2005 we have recorded charges for these future
obligations considering current market conditions and probable sublease income
and do not anticipate recording additional charges under this lease the lease
on our chicago distribution center expires in june 2005 we are making an effort
to find a tenant to sublease the facility when we vacate it later this year to
move to our new facility in joliet however if we are unable to locate a
suitable tenant we would have to record a charge for our future obligations
under this lease of approximately 10 million

     unless offsetting cost savings are realized adverse economic factors
including inflation in operating costs could harm our financial condition and
results of operations

potential future accounting pronouncements
     in march 2004 the financial accounting standards board issued an exposure
draft addressing the accounting for stockbased compensation a final standard
is expected by the end of 2004 proposed changes to the existing rules require
companies to recognize compensation expense for stock option grants when the
new rules are enacted we expect our results of operations to be materially
adversely affected however our cash flow and the underlying economics of our
financial condition are not expected to be materially affected we will continue
to monitor the development of the new standard and review our stockbased
compensation plans accordingly

item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

     we are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of our
business including the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency
rate fluctuations we may enter into interest rate swaps to manage exposure to
interest rate changes and we may employ other risk management strategies
including the use of foreign currency forward contracts we do not enter into
derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging purposes and
we do not hold derivative instruments for trading purposes

interest rate risk
     we have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk
consisting of debt and lease obligations issued at variable and fixed rates
based on amounts outstanding on our fixed rate debt obligations at january 31
2004 we do not consider our exposure to interest rate risk to be material

     we use variablerate debt to finance certain of our operations and capital
improvements these obligations expose us to variability in interest payments
due to changes in interest rates if interest rates increase interest expense
increases conversely if interest rates decrease interest expense also
decreases we believe it is beneficial to limit the variability of our interest
payments

     to meet this objective we entered into derivative instruments in the form
of interest rate swaps to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from
changes in the variableinterest rates on the obligations the interest rate
swaps reduce the interest rate exposure on these variablerate obligations
under the interest rate swap we pay the bank at a fixedrate and receive
variableinterest at a rate approximating the variablerate on the obligation
thereby creating the economic equivalent of a fixedrate obligation under the
190 million 100 million and 50 million interest rate swaps no payments
are made by parties under the swaps for monthly periods in which the
variableinterest rate is greater than the predetermined knockout rate

     the following table summarizes the financial terms of our interest rate
swap agreements and the fair value of each interest rate swap at january 31

hypothetically a 1 change in interest rates results in approximately a 06
million change in the amount paid or received under the terms of the interest
rate swap agreements on an annual basis due to many factors management is not
able to predict the changes in fair value of our interest rate swaps the fair
values are the estimated amounts we would pay or receive to terminate the
agreements as of the reporting date these fair values are obtained from an
outside financial institution

item 1  business

overview
     since our founding in 1986 we have become the leading operator of discount
variety stores offering merchandise at the fixed price of 100 we believe the
variety and quality of products we sell for 100 sets us apart from our
competitors at december 31 2002 we operated 2263 singleprice point stores
under the names of dollar tree dollar express dollar bills only one dollar
and only one

     since 1986 we have evolved from opening primarily mallbased stores
ranging between 1500 and 2500 selling square feet to opening primarily strip
shopping center based stores averaging 8000 to 10000 selling square feet in
the past five years we gradually increased the size of stores that we opened
each year as we improved our merchandise offerings and service to our customers
at december 31 1998 we operated 1285 stores in 31 states at december 31
2002 we operated 2263 stores in 40 states over the same time period our
selling square footage increased from approximately 49 million square feet in
december 1998 to 130 million square feet in december 2002 our store growth
since 1998 has resulted from opening new stores and completing selective mergers
and acquisitions from 1998 through 2000 we centrally manage our store and
distribution operations from our corporate headquarters in chesapeake virginia

business strategy
     value merchandise offering we strive to exceed our customers expectations
of the variety and quality of products that they can purchase for 100 by
offering items that we believe typically sell for higher prices elsewhere we
buy approximately 60 of our merchandise domestically and directly import the
remaining 40 we believe our mix of imported and domestic merchandise affords
our buyers flexibility that allows them to consistently exceed the customers
expectation in addition direct relationships with manufacturers permit us to
select from a broad range of products and customize packaging product sizes
and package quantities that meet our customers needs

     mix of basic variety and seasonal merchandise we maintain a balanced
selection of products within traditional variety store categories we offer a
wide selection of everyday basic product and we supplement these basic everyday
items with seasonal and closeout merchandise we attempt to keep certain basic
consumable merchandise in our stores continuously to establish our stores as a
destination closeout merchandise is purchased opportunistically and represents
less than 10 of our purchases national regional and privatelabel name brands
have become a bigger part of our merchandise mix

     our merchandise mix consists of

     o  consumable merchandise which includes candy and food health and
        beauty care and housewares such as paper plastics and household
        chemicals

     o  variety merchandise which includes toys durable housewares gifts
        hardware and other items and

     o  seasonal goods such as easter halloween and christmas merchandise

     our larger stores which appeal to a broader demographic mix carry more
consumable merchandise than smaller older stores as a result consumables have
grown as a percentage of purchases and sales the following table shows the
percentage of purchases of each major product group for the years ended december
31 2002 and 2001

                merchandise type                      2002             2001
                                                   

                variety categories                    506            507

     convenient locations and store size we primarily focus on opening new
stores in strip shopping centers anchored by mass merchandisers whose target
customers we believe to be similar to ours and in neighborhood centers anchored
by large grocery retailers our stores have proven successful in metropolitan
areas midsized cities and small towns the range of our store sizes allows us
to target a particular location with a store that best suits that market and
take advantage of available real estate opportunities our stores are
attractively designed and create an inviting atmosphere for shoppers by using
bright lighting vibrant colors uniform decorative signs and background music
we enhance the store design with attractive merchandise displays we believe
this design attracts new and repeat customers and enhances our image as both a
destination and impulse store

page

     profitable stores with strong cash flow we maintain a disciplined
costsensitive approach to store site selection in order to minimize the initial
capital investment required and maximize our potential to generate high
operating margins and strong cash flows we believe that our stores have a
relatively small shopping radius which allows us to profitably concentrate
multiple stores in a single market our ability to open new stores is dependent
upon among other factors locating suitable sites and negotiating favorable
lease terms

     on a cash basis our stores have historically experienced a payback period
of approximately 12 to 15 months and we expect this trend to continue during
the past five years we have maintained our storelevel cash operating income
margins in the 224 to 242 range stores whose first full year of operations
was 2002 had average store level cash operating income of approximately 228 of
sales which was better than the average for all stores with a full years
operations in 2002

     our older smaller stores continue to generate significant storelevel
operating income and operating cash flow and have some of the highest operating
margins among our stores the increased size of our newer stores allows us to
offer a wider selection of products including more basic consumable
merchandise thereby making them more attractive as a destination store

     in the past five years on an annual basis we have maintained our gross
profit margins in the 360 to 369 range and our operating income margins in
the 103 to 130 range historically we have experienced seasonal fluctuation
in our net sales operating income and net income because of our mix of seasonal
merchandise

     for more information on our results of operations see managements
discussion and analysis  results of operations on page 13 for more
information on seasonality of sales see managements discussion and analysis 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations on page 19

     cost control we believe that substantial buying power at the 100 price
point contributes to our successful purchasing strategy which includes
disciplined targeted merchandise margin goals by category we believe our
disciplined buying and quality merchandise help to minimize markdowns we buy
products on an orderbyorder basis and have no material longterm purchase
contracts or other assurances of continued product supply or guaranteed product
cost no vendor accounted for more than 10 of total merchandise purchased in
any of the past five years

     during 2002 we upgraded our supply chain systems and identified other
processes that could be improved using technology the new systems that we
implemented provide us with valuable sales information to assist our buyers and
improve merchandise allocation to our stores controlling our inventory levels
will result in more efficient distribution and store operations

     payroll and related costs are a significant component of our selling
general and administrative costs accordingly we believe that more efficient
use of labor hours in our stores could increase our profitability in an effort
to optimize hours worked in our stores we expect to implement a new labor
management and scheduling system during fiscal 2003

     information systems we believe that investments in appropriate technology
help us to increase sales and control costs as a result we initiated a supply
chain management project that encompassed four major components

     o  planning for our merchandise purchasing

     o  purchasing merchandise and allocating that merchandise throughout our
        distribution and retail network

     o  obtaining current and detailed sales information from stores using a
        pointofsale system and

     o  improving our ability to keep select merchandise in stock

     in april 2002 we implemented our new inventory management system we
expect that the new system will enable us to improve the efficiency of our
supply chain improve merchandise flow and control distribution and store
operation costs we continue to evaluate our processes to identify those that
would be improved using technology

     at december 31 2002 we operated pointofsale systems in 851 stores and
we plan to install pos in all new and expanded stores and convert more of our
existing stores to pos in fiscal 2003 we expect to have pos installed in
approximately 1800 stores by the end of fiscal 2003 pointofsale data allows
us to track sales by merchandise category and geographic region as well as
assists in planning for future purchases of inventory we believe that this
information will allow us to ship the appropriate product to the correct store
at the proper time

     corporate culture and values we believe that honesty and integrity doing
the right things for the right reasons and treating people fairly and with
respect are core values within our strong corporate culture we believe that
running a business and certainly a public company carries with it a
responsibility to be beyond reproach when making operational and financial
decisions our management team visits and shops our stores like every customer
we have an open door policy to all our associates and ideas and individuality
are encouraged we have standards for store displays merchandise presentation
and store operations our distribution centers are run based on objective
measures of performance and everyone in our store support center is here to
help associates in the stores and distribution centers get their jobs done

     a board of directors with an independent committee structure governs us
our board consists of a majority of independent directors all our committees 
audit compensation and nominating  consist solely of independent directors and
our audit committee chair is an audit committee financial expert we believe our
directors working on behalf of our shareholders are active in understanding
the financial aspects of the business the compensation of our management team
and the way in which we manage our business

     in 2002 we also established a disclosure committee to identify and monitor
internal financial reporting controls and to ensure that our public filings
contain discussions about the risks our business faces we have engaged an
internal audit service provider that will assist us in preparing for the next
round of requirements under the sarbanesoxley act we believe that we have the
controls in place to be able to certify our financial statements and have our
external auditors attest to our certifications additionally we have complied
with the updated listing requirements for the nasdaq stock market

     in the next year or so public companies will face more requirements and
regulations we expect to be ready to comply with all of them in the meantime
we will be reviewing all aspects of corporate governance to enhance the
transparency of our financial reporting improve the policies and procedures
that affect the way we act and increase the quality of our communications with
shareholders

growth strategy
     store openings and square footage growth the primary factors contributing
to our net sales growth have been new store openings an active store expansion
and remodel program and selective mergers and acquisitions from 1998 to 2002
net sales increased at a compound annual growth rate of 214 and operating
income excluding mergerrelated items increased at a compound annual growth
rate of 169 we expect that the substantial majority of our future sales
growth will come primarily from new store openings and secondarily from our
store expansion and remodeling program

     the following table shows the total selling square footage of our stores
and the selling square footage per new store opened over the last five years we
began opening larger stores after the acquisition of 98 cent clearance center in
1998 our growth and productivity statistics will be reported based on selling
square footage prospectively because our management believes the use of selling
square footage yields a more accurate measure of store productivity the selling
square footage statistics for 1998 through 2000 are estimates based on the
relationship of selling to gross square footage
                                                                average selling
                                            average selling     square footage
                                            square footage       per new store
        year          number of stores        per store             opened
                                       

        1998                1285              3790                 3840

        1999                1507              4055                 4765

        2000                1729              4520                 6240

     we expect to increase our selling square footage in the future by opening
new stores in underserved markets and strategically increasing our presence in
our existing markets via new store openings and store expansions expansions
include store relocations in fiscal 2003 and beyond we plan to predominately
open stores that are approximately 8000 to 10000 selling square feet and we
believe this size range allows us to achieve our objectives in the markets in
which we plan to expand at december 31 2002 468 of our stores totaling 369
of our selling square footage were 8000 selling square feet or larger

     in addition to new store openings we plan to continue our store expansion
program to increase our net sales per store and take advantage of market
opportunities we target stores for expansion based on the current sales per
square foot and changes in market opportunities stores targeted for expansion
are generally less than 3500 selling square feet in size store expansions
generally increase the existing store size by approximately 4500 to 6500
selling square feet

     since 1995 we have added a total of 371 stores through three mergers and
several small acquisitions our acquisition strategy has been to target
companies with a similar single price

point concept that have shown success in operations or provide a strategic
advantage we evaluate potential acquisition opportunities in our retail sector
as they become available

     merchandising and distribution expanding our customer base is important to
our growth plans we will continue to stock our new stores with the
everchanging merchandise that our current customers have come to appreciate in
addition we are opening larger stores that contain more basic consumable
merchandise to attract new customers consumable merchandise typically leads to
more frequent return trips to our stores resulting in increased sales the
presentation and display of merchandise in our stores are critical to
communicating value to our customers and creating a more exciting shopping
experience we believe our approach to visual merchandising results in high
store traffic high sales volume and an environment that encourages impulse
purchases

     a strong and efficient distribution network is key to our ability to grow
and to maintain a lowcost operating structure we currently operate seven
distribution centers which are capable of supporting approximately 31 billion
in annual sales we will continue to add distribution capacity to support our
store opening plans with the aim of remaining approximately one year ahead of
our distribution needs new distribution sites are strategically located to
reduce stem miles maintain flexibility and improve efficiency in our store
service areas

     our stores receive approximately 97 of their inventory from our seven
distribution centers via contract carriers the remaining store inventory
primarily perishable consumable items and other vendormaintained display items
are delivered directly to our stores from vendors for more information on our
distribution center network see properties below

competition
     the retail industry is highly competitive and we expect competition to
increase in the future the value discount retail sector currently represents
approximately 10 of the 300 billion discount retail market and appears to be
the fastest growing our value discount retail competitors include family
dollar dollar general 99 cents only and big lots the principal methods of
competition include convenience and the quality of merchandise offered to the
customer though we are a fixedprice point retailer we also compete to a
lesser extent with mass merchandisers such as walmart and target and
regional discount retailers

trademarks
     we are the owners of federal service mark registrations for dollar tree
the dollar tree logo 1 dollar tree together with the related design and
one priceone dollar a small number of our stores operate under the name
only one dollar for which we have not obtained a service mark registration
we also own a concurrent use registration for dollar bill and the related
logo during 1997 we acquired the rights to use trade names previously owned by
everythings a dollar a former competitor in the 100 price point industry
several trade names were included in the purchase including the marks
everythings 100 we mean everything and everythings 100 the
registration of which is pending with the acquisition of dollar express we
became the owner of the service marks dollar express and dollar expres we
also occasionally market products under various private labels but these brand
names are not material to our operations

employees
     we employed approximately 8600 fulltime and 18800 parttime associates
on december 31 2002 the number of parttime associates fluctuates depending on
seasonal needs we consider our relationship with our associates to be good and
we have not experienced significant interruptions of operations due to labor
disagreements none of our employees is subject to collective bargaining
agreements

     we currently lease our stores and expect to continue to lease new stores
as we expand our leases typically provide for a short initial lease term
generally five years with options to extend we believe this leasing strategy
enhances our flexibility to pursue various expansion opportunities resulting
from changing market conditions

     as current leases expire we believe that we will be able either to obtain
lease renewals if desired for present store locations or to obtain leases for
equivalent or better locations in the same general area to date we have not
experienced difficulty in either renewing leases for existing locations or
securing leases for suitable locations for new stores from time to time we may
not comply with certain provisions of our store operating leases we maintain
good relations with our landlords and believe that violation of these lease
provisions if any will not have a material effect on our operations

distribution centers
     the following table includes information about the distribution centers
that we currently operate we believe our operational distribution centers can
support a total of approximately 31 billion in annual sales

      these facilities are owned by a variable interest entity that we include
in our consolidated financial statements effective january 1 2003

     we are planning to open a new distribution center in the northwest in early
to mid2004 we are also planning to relocate our chicago distribution center
and expand it this facility is expected to open during the third quarter of
2004 in addition to our distribution centers noted above during the past
several years we have used offsite facilities to accommodate limited quantities
of seasonal merchandise

     four of our distribution centers are financed through a variable interest
entity which we include in our consolidated financial statements effective
january 1 2003 the variable interest entity owns these distribution center
assets and carries the debt used to finance them terms of the debt among other
things require the maintenance of certain specified financial ratios restrict
the payment of certain distributions and limit certain types of debt we can
incur

     with the exception of our current chicago facility each of our
distribution centers contain advanced materials handling technologies including
an automated conveyor and sorting system radiofrequency inventory tracking
equipment and specialized information systems we completed the expansion and
automation of our stockton distribution center in january 2002

     we currently have two former distribution centers for which we are liable
for future rents the leases on these facilities expire at various dates through
june 2008 we make every effort to sublease these facilities and have subleased
certain of the vacated facilities under agreements expiring at various dates
through june 2008

     we have been sued in california by several employees and in alabama by a
salaried store manager and a former store manager who allege that they should
have been classified as nonexempt employees and therefore should have
received overtime compensation the suits also request that the california state
court certify the case as a class action on behalf of all store managers
assistant managers and merchandise managers in our california stores and request
that the alabama federal court certify the case as a collective action under the
fair labor standards act on behalf of all salaried managers in all of our
stores we will vigorously defend ourselves in these matters

in managements discussion and analysis we explain the general financial
condition and the results of operations for our company including

     o  what factors affect our business

     o  what our earnings and costs were in 2002 and 2001

     o  why those earnings and costs were different from the year before

     o  how all of this affects our overall financial condition

     o  what our expenditures for capital projects were in 2002 and what we
        expect them to be in 2003 and

     o  where funds will come from to pay for future expenditures

     as you read managements discussion and analysis please refer to our
consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10k which
present the results of operations for 2002 2001 and 2000 in managements
discussion and analysis we analyze and explain the annual changes in some
specific line items in the consolidated financial statements

key events and recent developments
     several key events have had or are expected to have a significant effect on
our results of operations you should keep in mind that

     o  in february 2003 we opened a new 603000 square foot automated
        distribution center in marietta oklahoma

     o  in january 2003 we changed our fiscal year from a calendar year to a
        retail fiscal year ending on the saturday closest to january 31 our
        first fiscal year reported will be fiscal 2003 fiscal 2003 is the
        period beginning february 2 2003 and ending january 31 2004

     o  in april 2002 we implemented a new supply chain management system

     o  in january 2002 we completed the expansion and automation of our
        stockton california distribution center which increased the size to
        525000 square feet this distribution center opened in january 2000
        and replaced the former 98 cent clearance center facility in
        sacramento california

     o  in august 2001 we opened a new 600000 square foot automated
        distribution center in briar creek pennsylvania this new facility
        replaced the former dollar express distribution facilities in
        philadelphia pennsylvania

     o  in january 2001 we opened a new 600000 square foot automated
        distribution center in savannah georgia

     o  in may 2000 we merged with dollar express and issued or reserved
        9000000 shares of our common stock in exchange for dollar express
        outstanding stock and options dollar express operated 132 stores
        primarily in the midatlantic region

     we accounted for the dollar express merger as a pooling of interests as a
result all financial and operational data assume that dollar express had been a
part of dollar tree throughout all periods presented for each period presented
the outstanding dollar express shares of stock have been converted into dollar
tree shares based on the exchange ratio used in the merger

results of operations
     our net sales derive from the sale of merchandise two major factors tend
to affect our net sales trends first is our success at opening new stores or
adding new stores through mergers or acquisitions second sales may vary at our
existing stores from one year to the next we refer to this change as a change
in comparable store net sales because we compare only those stores that are
open throughout both of the periods being compared we include expanded stores
in the calculation of comparable store net sales which has the effect of
increasing our comparable store net sales the term expanded also includes
stores that are relocated

     most retailers have the ability to increase their merchandise prices or
alter the mix of their merchandise to favor higherpriced items in order to
increase their comparable store net sales as a fixedprice retailer we do not
have the ability to raise our prices generally our comparable store net sales
will increase only if we sell more merchandise our plans for fiscal 2003
operations anticipate comparable store net sales increases of 0 to 1 and net
sales and earnings increases of at least 15 based on fiscal 2002 earnings of
127 per share we may be unable to predict our actual operating results
accurately

     we expect the substantial majority of our future net sales growth to come
from square footage growth resulting from new store openings and expansion of
existing stores in fiscal 2003 we plan to increase our selling square footage
approximately 22 or approximately 29 million square feet 09 million of
which will come from expansions we expect the average size of new stores opened
in fiscal 2003 to be approximately 9000 selling square feet per store in
fiscal 2003 and beyond we plan to predominately open stores that are
approximately 8000 to 10000 selling square feet we believe this size range
allows us to achieve our objectives in the markets in which we plan to expand
larger stores take longer to negotiate build out and open and generally have
lower net sales per square foot than our smaller stores while our newer larger
stores have lower sales per square foot than older smaller stores they
generate higher sales and operating income per store and create an improved
shopping environment that invites customers to shop longer and buy more

     we must control our merchandise costs inventory levels and our general and
administrative expenses increases in expenses could negatively impact our
operating results because we cannot pass on increased expenses to our customers
by increasing our merchandise price above the 100 price point

     we will continue to experience pressure on our gross profit margins in
future years as we refine our merchandise mix to include a higher proportion of
consumable merchandise which typically carries a lower gross profit margin
open larger stores and continue to absorb higher costs we do expect to
partially offset the effect of the above factors with improved domestic freight
costs created by the addition of our new distribution center in 2003 even with
our changing merchandise mix we expect our gross profit margin will approximate
36 in the foreseeable future because we can vary the mix among our consumable
products and variety categories to impact our gross margin in addition
consumable merchandise typically leads to more frequent return trips to our
stores resulting in increased sales

     leveraging our selling general and administrative expenses is difficult
because a substantial majority of our future sales growth is expected to come
primarily from new store openings rather than from comparable store net sales

percentage of net sales

2002 compared to 2001
     net sales net sales increased 172 in 2002 compared to 2001 we attribute
this 3419 million increase in net sales primarily to our new stores opened in
2002 and 2001 which are not included in our comparable store net sales
increase and to a comparable store net sales increase of 10 in 2002
comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated
stores which we include in the calculation and to a lesser extent are
negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing
stores

     we opened 318 new stores and closed 30 stores during 2002 compared to 276
new stores opened and 30 stores closed in 2001 during 2002 we opened larger
stores than originally planned which required us to shift our store openings to
later in the third quarter and shift some store openings into the fourth
quarter we added 288 to our selling square footage in 2002 compared to 296
in 2001 of the 29 million in selling square footage increase in 2002
approximately 05 million selling square feet was added by expanding 111
existing stores our square footage growth in the future will come primarily
from larger stores

     gross profit gross profit margin increased to 364 in 2002 compared to
360 in 2001 this increase in gross profit margin in 2002 was primarily due to
improved inventory shrink this improvement is primarily attributed to lower
shrink in our dollar express stores and our philadelphia distribution network
and adjustments to our distribution center shrink in connection with our supply
chain management system implementation in addition merchandise costs
increased but were partially offset by improvements in freight costs

     selling general and administrative expenses selling general and
administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales to 255 compared
to 257 in 2001 this decrease is primarily the result of savings achieved from
our implementation of various expensemanagement initiatives particularly with
regard to payrollrelated expenses partially offset by an increase in
depreciation and amortization expense the increase in depreciation expense
resulted primarily from depreciation costs associated with our new inventory
management system our store relocation and expansion program and the opening
of new larger stores in addition effective january 1 2002 we ceased
amortization of goodwill in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 142 we
recorded approximately 20 million of goodwill amortization in 2001

     operating income due to the reasons discussed above operating income
increased to 2539 million in 2002 from 2039 million in 2001 and increased as
a percentage of net sales to 109 from 103

     interest income and expense interest income in 2002 was consistent with
2001 decreased interest rates throughout 2002 were offset by increased levels
of cash and cash equivalents interest expense decreased 09 million in 2002
compared to 2001 due to repayments of our longterm debt and a decrease in
interest on our capitalized leases we benefited slightly from the decrease in
variable interest rates in 2002 however this benefit was partially offset as a
result of the interest rate swaps in effect during 2002

     income taxes our effective tax rate was 385 in 2002 and 2001 and we
expect the rate to remain the same in fiscal 2003

2001 compared to 2000
     net sales net sales increased 177 in 2001 compared to 2000 we attribute
this 2992 increase in net sales primarily to our new stores opened in 2001 and
2000 which are not included in our comparable store net sales results
comparable store net sales increased 01 in 2001

     we believe comparable store net sales remained relatively flat in 2001
because the retail environment in 2001 was unusually difficult in light of the
economic downturn and the events of september 11 2001 in addition our easter
selling season was shorter in 2001 compared to 2000 because easter was
approximately one week earlier in 2001 than 2000

     we opened 276 new stores and closed 30 stores during 2001 compared to 233
new stores opened and 11 stores closed in 2000 we added 296 to our selling
square footage in 2001 compared to 279 in 2000 of the 23 million selling
square footage increase in 2001 approximately 04 million selling square feet
was added by expanding 111 existing stores

     gross profit excluding 11 million of mergerrelated costs recorded in
2000 gross profit margin decreased to 360 in 2001 compared to 370 in 2000
this decrease in gross profit margin in 2001 was primarily due to loss of
leverage on occupancy costs and increases in shrink in the nowclosed
philadelphia distribution facilities

     selling general and administrative expenses excluding 33 million of
mergerrelated expenses in 2000 selling general and administrative expenses
increased as a percentage of net sales to 257 compared to 247 in 2000 this
increase is primarily the result of increases in payrollrelated costs
including insurance certain store operating expenses depreciation and
amortization expense and charges recorded in connection with our closed
distribution facilities in philadelphia the increases in payrollrelated costs
store operating expenses and depreciation and amortization were primarily due to
loss of leverage

     operating income due to the reasons discussed above excluding 44
million of mergerrelated items in 2000 operating income decreased to 2039
million in 2001 from 2074 million in 2000 and decreased as a percentage of net
sales to 103 from 123

     interest income and expense interest income decreased 07 million in 2001
compared to 2000 the decrease resulted primarily from decreased interest rates
throughout 2001 interest expense decreased 24 million in 2001 compared to
2000 this decrease was primarily due to the repayment of a revolving credit
facility and term loan in may 2000 we benefited slightly from the decrease in
variable interest rates in 2001 because of our variablerate operating leases
and variablerate debt however this benefit was partially offset as a result
of the interest rate swaps in effect during 2001

     income taxes our effective tax rate decreased to 385 for the year ended
december 31 2001 from 388 for the year ended december 31 2000 because 2000
included certain nondeductible mergerrelated expenses related to dollar
express

liquidity and capital resources
     our business requires capital to open new stores expand our distribution
network and operate existing stores our working capital requirements for
existing stores are seasonal and usually reach their peak in september and
october historically we have satisfied our seasonal working capital
requirements for existing stores and have funded our store opening and expansion
programs from internally generated funds and seasonal borrowings under our
credit facilities

december 31 2002 2001 and 2000

                                                                              year ended december 31

     financing activities           225         18         129


     the 282 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in
2002 was due primarily to net income before depreciation expense this increase
was offset by an increase in cash paid for income taxes
due primarily to the timing of payments

     cash used in investing activities is generally expended to open new stores
the 523 million increase in 2002 compared to 2001 was primarily due to the
following

     o  our increased profitability in 2002 provided us with additional cash
        which we invested in shortterm securities

     o  we increased the number of new stores opened and the average size
        of those stores in 2002 we also increased the size of our
        expanded stores

     o  we invested in technology to improve our supply chain processes

     the 243 million increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2002
compared with 2001 was primarily the result of the following

     o  we received 207 million more cash pursuant to stockbased
        compensation plans in 2002 compared to 2001 because of an increase
        in the amount of stock option exercises which we believe resulted
        from the increased stock price in the first half of 2002

     o  we paid 38 million in 2001 to repurchase shares in accordance
        with the securities and exchange commissions emergency relief
        order which has since expired we did not repurchase any common
        stock in 2002

     o  we made a 60 million principal payment on the senior notes in
        2002 and 2001 in 2000 we made net repayments of approximately
        342 million due to repayment of dollar express term loan and
        revolving credit facility and the first principal payment on the
        senior notes

     at december 31 2002 our longterm borrowings were 310 million and our
capital lease commitments were 280 million we had 500 million available
through a revolving credit facility we also have 1250 million available under
the letter of credit reimbursement and security agreement of which
approximately 730 million was committed to letters of credit issued for
routine purchases of imported merchandise

     we adopted the requirements of financial accounting standards board
interpretation no 46 consolidation of variable interest entities early
effective january 1 2003 as a result we consolidated the variable interest
entity used to finance the construction of four of our distribution centers our
longterm borrowings including debt related to the variable interest entity at
february 1 2003 were 1716 million

funding requirements

overview
     we plan to increase our selling square footage by approximately 22 in
fiscal 2003 in 2002 the average investment per new store including capital
expenditures initial inventory and preopening costs was approximately
351000

     we expect our cash needs for opening new stores and expanding existing
stores in fiscal 2003 to total approximately 1563 million which includes
approximately 1127 million for capital expenditures and 436 million for
initial inventory and preopening costs our total planned capital expenditures
for fiscal 2003 are approximately 2755 million including planned expenditures
for new and expanded stores new and relocated distribution centers and
investments in technology we believe that we can adequately fund our working
capital requirements and planned capital expenditures except for the new and
relocated distribution centers for the next few years from net cash provided by
operations and borrowings under our existing credit facilities we believe that
we will be able to obtain adequate funding to construct our new distribution
centers

lease financing
     operating lease obligations our operating lease obligations are primarily
for payments under noncancelable store leases the commitment includes amounts
for leases that were signed prior to december 31 2002 for stores that were not
yet open on december 31 2002

     capital lease obligations primarily saleleaseback in september 1999 we
sold certain retail store leasehold improvements to an unrelated third party and
leased them back for seven years we have an option to repurchase the leasehold
improvements in september 2004 and september 2006 at amounts approximating their
fair market values at the time the option is exercised the transaction is
treated as a financing arrangement for financial accounting purposes the total
amount of the lease obligation is 234 million we are required to make monthly
lease payments

of 438000 in the first five years and 638000 in the sixth and seventh years
as a result of the transaction we received net cash of 209 million and an
81 million 110 note receivable which matures in september 2006 the amount
of the lease obligation will equal the amount outstanding under the note
receivable in september 2006

     variable interest entity in march 2001 we entered into an operating lease
known as a synthetic lease to finance the construction of several of our
distribution centers at december 31 2002 approximately 1545 million of the
1650 million facility was committed to the stockton savannah briar creek and
marietta facilities because we accounted for this transaction as an operating
lease prior to january 1 2003 the related fixed assets and lease liabilities
were not included in our balance sheets and payments under the lease were
included in rent expense


     in january 2003 the financial accounting standards board issued fasb
interpretation no 46 after evaluating this new standard our board of
directors and management determined that we would maintain the existing terms
of the facility and include the variable interest entity in our consolidated
financial statements effective january 1 2003 as a result of the
implementation the distribution center assets the financingrelated costs and
the debt incurred by the variable interest entity to purchase and construct the
assets are included on our balance sheets for periods after january 1 2003
interest is payable monthly and the principal amount is payable upon maturity of
the debt in march 2006 the debt among other things requires the maintenance
of certain specified financial ratios restricts the payment of certain
distributions and limits certain types of debt we can incur estimated payments
under this facility at february 1 2003 are included in the table above as a
result of consolidating the entity we expect our noncash annual costs to
increase 86 million 53 million net of tax we also expect our return on
assets ratio to decrease because of the consolidation of the variable interest
entity


     for more information on the variable interest entity see footnote 5 of the
consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k

longterm borrowings
     revenue bond financing in may 1998 we entered into an agreement with the
mississippi business finance corporation under which it issued 190 million of
variablerate demand revenue bonds we borrowed the proceeds from the bonds to
finance the acquisition construction and installation of land buildings
machinery and equipment for our distribution facility in olive branch
mississippi at december 31 2002 the balance outstanding on the bonds was
190 million we begin repayment of the principal amount of the bonds in june
2006 with a portion maturing each june 1 until the final portion matures in
june 2018 the bonds do not have a prepayment penalty as long as the interest
rate remains variable the bonds contain a demand provision and therefore
outstanding amounts are classified as current liabilities we pay interest
monthly based on a variable interest rate which was 15 at december 31 2002
the bonds are secured by a 193 million letter of credit issued by one of our
existing lending banks the letter of credit is renewable annually the letter
of credit and reimbursement agreement require that we maintain specified
financial ratios and it restricts our ability to pay cash dividends

     debt securities in april 1997 we issued 300 million of 729 unsecured
senior notes proceeds from which indirectly financed a portion of our
chesapeake distribution center and corporate headquarters we pay interest on
the notes semiannually on april 30 and october 30 each year and we pay principal
in five equal annual installments of 60 million which began april 30 2000
the note holders have the right to require us to prepay the notes in full
without premium upon a change of control or upon specified asset dispositions or
other transactions we may make the note agreements prohibit specified mergers
and consolidations in which our company is not the surviving company require
that we maintain specified financial ratios require that the notes rank on par
with other debt and limit the amount of debt we can incur in the event of
default or a prepayment at our option we must pay a penalty to the note holder

commitments
     unsecured revolving credit facility effective march 12 2001 we entered
into a revolving credit facility with our banks which provides for a 500
million unsecured revolving credit facility to be used for working capital
bearing interest at the agent banks prime rate or libor plus a spread at our
option the credit agreement among other things requires the maintenance of
specified ratios restricts the payment of certain distributions and limits
certain types of debt we can incur the facility was originally scheduled to
terminate on march 11 2002 however we have extended it to may 30 2003 and
expect to extend it on or prior to its expiration

     letters of credit effective march 12 2001 we entered into a letter of
credit reimbursement and security agreement which provides 1250 million for
letters of credit which are generally issued for the routine purchase of
imported merchandise approximately 730 million was committed to letters of
credit at december 31 2002 the facility expires on may 30 2003 however we
expect it to be extended we also have letters of credit or surety bonds
outstanding for our revenue bond financing our highdeductible insurance
program and utility



                                       17

payments at our stores in addition we have issued a guarantee for 200
million that is used by one of our suppliers as collateral the guarantee is
secured by letters of credit totaling 200 million that expire in 2003

     freight contracts we have contracted outbound freight services from
various carriers with contracts expiring through august 2003 the total amount
of these commitments is approximately 350 million

derivative financial instruments
     we are party to four interest rate swaps
which allow us to manage the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations on
the demand revenue bonds and a portion of our variablerate variable interest
entity debt the swaps are based on notional amounts of 190 million 100
million 50 million and 250 million under the 190 million 100 million
and 50 million agreements as amended we pay interest to the banks that
provided the swaps at a fixed rate in exchange the financial institution pays
us at variable interest rates which are similar to the rates on the demand
revenue bonds and our variablerate operating leases the variable interest
rates on the interest rate swaps are set monthly no payments are made by either
party under the swaps for monthly periods with an established interest rate
greater than a predetermined rate the knockout rate the swaps may be
canceled by the bank or us and settled for the fair value of the swap as
determined by market rates

     the 250 million interest rate swap agreement is used to manage the risk
associated with interest rate fluctuations on a portion of our variable interest
entity debt under this agreement we pay interest to a financial institution at
a fixed rate of 543 in exchange the financial institution pays us at a
variable interest rate which approximates the floating rate on the debt
excluding the credit spread the interest rate on the swap is subject to
adjustment monthly the swap is effective through march 2006 but it may be
canceled by the bank or us and settled for the fair value of the swap as
determined by market rates

     because of the knockout provision in the 190 million 100 million and
50 million interest rate swaps changes in the fair value of those swaps are
recorded in earnings changes in fair value on our 250 million interest rate
swap are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in
the consolidated balance sheets because the swap qualifies for hedge accounting
treatment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no
133 as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 138 the
amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income are subsequently
reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the related interest
affects earnings

qualitative disclosures about market risk  interest rate risk on page 21

critical accounting policies
     the preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates
certain of our estimates require a high level of judgment and have the potential
to have a material effect on the financial statements if actual results vary
significantly from those estimates following is a discussion of the estimates
that we consider critical

inventory valuation
     as discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements
inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or
market with cost determined on a weightedaverage basis cost is assigned to
store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weightedaverage basis
under the retail inventory method the valuation of inventories at cost and the
resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated costtoretail
ratio to the retail value of inventories the retail inventory method is an
averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry and results in
valuing inventories at lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a
reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis

     inventory valuation methods require certain significant management
estimates and judgments including estimates of merchandise markdowns and
shrink which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as
well as the resulting gross margins the averaging required in applying the
retail inventory method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns could under
certain circumstances result in costs not being recorded in the proper period

     we estimate our markdown reserve based on the consideration of a variety of
factors including but not limited to quantities of slow moving or carryover
seasonal merchandise on hand historical markdown statistics and future
merchandising plans the accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many
factors some of which are outside of our control including changes in economic
conditions and consumer buying trends historically we have not experienced
significant differences in our estimates of markdowns compared with actual
results

     our accrual for shrink is based on the actual historical shrink results of
our most recent physical inventories adjusted if necessary for current
economic conditions these estimates are compared to actual results as physical
inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger the majority of
our counts are taken between january and may of each year


                                       18
page

therefore the shrink accrual recorded at december 31 2002 is based on
estimated shrink for most of 2002 including the fourth quarter we have not
experienced significant fluctuations in historical shrink rates in our dollar
tree stores however we have sometimes experienced higher than typical shrink
in acquired stores in the year following an acquisition as was experienced in
the former dollar express distribution facilities and stores in 2001 we
periodically adjust our shrink estimates to address these factors as they become
apparent

     our management believes that our application of the retail inventory method
results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results
in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market

accrued expenses
     on a monthly basis we estimate certain material expenses in an effort to
record those expenses in the period incurred our most material estimates relate
to domestic freight insurancerelated expenses certain store level operating
expenses such as property taxes and utilities and other expenses our freight
and storelevel operating expenses are estimated based on current activity and
historical results our workers compensation and general liability insurance
accruals are recorded based on actuarial valuation methods performed by
thirdparty actuaries these actuarial valuations are estimates based on
historical loss development factors other expenses are estimated and recorded
in the periods that management becomes aware of them the related accruals are
adjusted as managements estimates change differences in managements estimates
and assumptions could result in an accrual materially different from the
calculated accrual our experience has been that some of our estimates are too
high and others are too low historically the net total of these differences
has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of
operations

income taxes
     on a monthly basis we estimate our required tax liability and assess the
recoverability of our deferred tax assets our taxes payable are estimated based
on enacted tax rates including estimated tax rates in states where our store
base is growing applied to the income expected to be taxed currently management
assesses the realizability of our deferred tax asset based on the availability
of carrybacks of future deductible amounts and managements projections for
future taxable income we cannot guarantee that we will generate income in
future years historically we have not experienced significant differences in
our estimates of our tax accrual

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations
     we experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales comparable store net
sales operating income and net income and expect this trend to continue our
results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety
of factors including

     o  shifts in the timing of certain holidays especially easter

     o  the timing of new store openings

     o  the net sales contributed by new stores

     o  changes in our merchandise mix and

     o  competition

     our highest sales periods are the christmas and easter seasons easter was
observed on march 31 2002 and will be observed on april 20 2003 in addition
there were six fewer selling days between thanksgiving and christmas in 2002 as
compared to 2001 the decrease in the selling season resulted from the shift of
thanksgiving from november 22 2001 to november 28 2002 we generally realize a
disproportionate amount of our net sales and a substantial majority of our
operating and net income during the fourth quarter in anticipation of increased
sales activity during these months we purchase substantial amounts of inventory
and hire a significant number of temporary employees to supplement our permanent
store staff our operating results particularly operating and net income could
suffer if our net sales were below seasonal norms during the fourth quarter or
during the easter season for any reason including merchandise delivery delays
due to receiving or distribution problems

     our unaudited results of operations for the eight most recent quarters are
shown in a table in footnote 12 of the consolidated financial statements in item
8 of this form 10k

inflation and other economic factors
     our ability to provide quality merchandise at a fixed price and on a
profitable basis may be subject to economic factors and influences that we
cannot control the outbreak of war or other national or international events
including terrorism could lead to disruptions in the economy that could result
in decreased consumer spending and increases in costs that are critical to our

operating costs

     shipping costs in the past we have experienced annual increases of as
much as 33 in our transpacific shipping rates due primarily to rate increases
imposed by the transpacific shipping cartel currently transpacific shipping
rates are negotiated with individual freight lines and are subject to
fluctuation based on supply and demand for containers as a result our
transpacific shipping rates may increase when we renegotiate our import
shipping rates effective may 2003

     during 2000 we experienced a 12 million increase in our domestic freight
costs because of increased domestic fuel costs during 2001 we experienced a
04 million increase in freight costs compared to 2000 resulting from increased
domestic fuel costs because of rising fuel costs in 2003 we expect to
experience larger increases in freight costs than in past years

     minimum wage although our average hourly wage rate is significantly higher
than the federal minimum wage an increase in the mandated minimum wage could
significantly increase our payroll costs in february 2000 the us senate
approved a proposal increasing the federal minimum wage by 100 per hour over
three years in march 2000 the us house of representatives approved a
proposal increasing the federal minimum wage by 100 per hour over two years
no bill was passed into law and the status of this issue in the 2003 congress is
uncertain if the federal minimum wage were to increase by 100 per hour we
believe that our annual payroll expenses would increase by approximately 10 to
15 of operating expenses unless we realize offsetting cost reductions

     leases for replaced distribution centers we are liable for rent and
passthrough costs under two leases for nowclosed distribution centers whose
leases expire at various dates through june 2008 annual rent and passthrough
costs on these facilities are approximately 15 million in fiscal 2003 and
2004 12 million in fiscal 2005 06 million in fiscal 2006 and 2007 and 03
million in fiscal 2008 certain of these distribution facilities have been
subleased under agreements expiring at various dates through june 2008 we have
recorded charges for these future obligations for certain of the facilities
considering current market conditions and probable sublease income at each
location

     unless offsetting cost savings are realized adverse economic factors
including inflation in operating costs could harm our financial condition and
results of operations

new accounting pronouncements

eitf issue 0216
     the fasbs eitf issue 0216 accounting by a customer including a
reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor addresses the
accounting treatment for vendor allowances we have only insignificant allowance
agreements with our vendors therefore we do not expect the adoption of this
pronouncement to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of
operations

potential future accounting pronouncements

grants if new rules are enacted our results of operations could be materially
adversely affected



item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

     we are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of our
business including the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency
rate fluctuations we may enter into interest rate swaps to manage exposure to
interest rate changes and we may employ other risk management strategies
including the use of foreign currency forward contracts we do not enter into
derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging purposes and
we do not hold derivative instruments for trading purposes

interest rate risk
     we have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk
consisting of debt and lease obligations issued at variable and fixed rates
based on amounts outstanding on our fixed rate debt obligations at december 31
2002 we do not consider our exposure to interest rate risk to be material

     we use variablerate debt to finance certain of our operations and capital
improvements these obligations expose us to variability in interest payments
due to changes in interest rates if interest rates increase interest expense
increases conversely if interest rates decrease interest expense also
decreases we believe it is beneficial to limit the variability of our interest
payments

     to meet this objective we entered into derivative instruments in the form
of interest rate swaps to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from
changes in the variable interest rates on the obligations the interest rate
swaps reduce the interest rate exposure on these variablerate obligations
under the interest rate swap we pay the bank at a fixed rate and receive
variable interest at a rate approximating the variablerate on the obligation
thereby creating the economic equivalent of a fixed rate obligation under the
190 million 100 million and 50 million interest rate swaps no payments
are made by parties under the swaps for monthly periods in which the variable
interest rate is greater than the predetermined knockout rate



     the following table summarizes the financial terms of our interest rate
swap agreements and the fair value of each interest rate swap at december 31
2002

hypothetically a 1 change in interest rates results in approximately a 06
million change in the amount paid or received under the terms of the interest
rate swap agreements on an annual basis due to many factors management is not
able to predict the changes in fair value of our interest rate swaps the fair
values are the estimated amounts we would pay or receive to terminate the
agreements as of the reporting date these fair values are obtained from an
outside financial institution



foreign currency risk
     although we purchase most of our imported goods with us dollars we are
subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to payments to suppliers
in euros formerly italian lire when favorable exchange rates exist we may
hedge foreign currency commitments of future payments by purchasing foreign
currency forward contracts on december 31 2002 we had no contracts
outstanding less than 1 of our purchases are contracted in euros and the
market risk exposure relating to currency exchange rate fluctuations is not
material

item 1  business

overview
     since our founding in 1986 we have become the leading operator of discount
variety stores offering merchandise at the fixed price of 100 we believe the
variety and quality of products we sell for 100 sets us apart from our
competitors

     since 1986 dollar tree has evolved from opening primarily mallbased
stores ranging between 2000 to 3000 selling square feet to opening primarily
stripshopping center based stores ranging between 7000 to 10000 selling
square feet in the past five years we gradually increased the size of stores
that we opened each year as we improved our merchandise offerings and service to
our customers at december 31 1997 we operated 1059 stores in 28 states at
december 31 2001 we operated 1975 stores in 37 states over the same time
period our selling square footage increased from approximately 39 million
square feet in december 1997 to 101 million square feet in december 2001 our
store growth since 1997 has resulted from opening new stores and completing
selective mergers and acquisitions from 1998 through 2000 we centrally manage
our store and distribution operations from our corporate headquarters in
chesapeake virginia

     at december 31 2001 we operated 1963 singleprice point stores that
operate under the names of dollar tree dollar express dollar bills only one
dollar and only one we also operate 12 multiprice point stores under the name
spains cards and gifts

business strategy
     value offering we strive to exceed our customers expectations of the
variety and quality of products that can be purchased for 100 by offering
items that we believe typically sell for higher prices elsewhere we buy
approximately 55 of our merchandise domestically and directly import the
remaining 45 we believe our mix of imported and domestic merchandise affords
our buyers flexibility that allows them to consistently exceed the customers
expectation in addition direct relationships with manufacturers permit us to
select from a broad range of products and customize packaging product sizes
and package quantities that meet our customers needs

                                       4
page

     changing merchandise mix we maintain a balanced selection of products
within traditional variety store categories we offer a wide selection of
everyday basic products and we supplement these basic everyday items with
seasonal and closeout merchandise we attempt to keep certain basic consumable
merchandise in our stores continuously to establish our stores as a destination
store for our customers closeout merchandise is purchased opportunistically and
represents less than 15 of our purchases we also take advantage of the
availability of lowerpriced privatelabel and regional brand goods which we
believe are comparable to national name brands

     our merchandise mix consists of 1 consumable merchandise which includes
candy and food health and beauty care and housewares such as paper and
plastics 2 variety merchandise which include toys housewares party goods
gifts stationery and other items and 3 seasonal goods such as easter
halloween and christmas merchandise the following table shows the percentage of
purchases of each major product group for the years ended december 31 2001 and
2000

     site selection and store format we primarily focus on opening new stores
in strip shopping centers anchored by mass merchandisers whose target customers
we believe to be similar to ours and in neighborhood centers anchored by large
grocery retailers our stores have proven successful in metropolitan areas
midsized cities and small towns the range of our store sizes allows us to
target a particular location with a store that best suits that market and take
advantage of real estate opportunities when available our stores are
attractively designed and create an inviting atmosphere for shoppers by using
bright lighting vibrant colors uniform decorative signs carpeting and
background music we believe this design attracts new and repeat customers and
enhances our image as both a destination and impulse store

     for more information on retail locations and retail store leases see
properties on page 7

     strong and consistent store level economics we maintain a disciplined
costsensitive approach to store site selection in order to minimize the initial
capital investment required and maximize our potential to generate high
operating margins we believe that our stores have a relatively small shopping
radius which allows us to profitably concentrate multiple stores in a single
market our ability to open new stores is dependent upon among other factors
locating suitable sites and negotiating favorable lease terms

     on a cash basis our stores have historically experienced a payback period
of approximately 12 to 15 months and we expect this trend to continue during
the past five years we have maintained our storelevel operating income margins
in the 210 to 231 range stores whose first full year of operations was 2001
had average store level operating income of approximately 210 as a percent of
sales

     our older smaller stores continue to generate a significant amount of
storelevel operating income and operating cash flow and have some of the
highest operating margins among our stores the increased size of our newer
stores allows us to offer a wider selection of products including more basic
consumable merchandise thereby making them more attractive as a destination
store

     in the past five years we have maintained our gross profit margins in the
349 to 369 range and our operating income margins in the 103 to 130
range historically we have experienced seasonal fluctuation in our net sales
operating income and net income because of our mix of seasonal merchandise

     for more information on our results of operations see managements
discussion and analysis  results of operations on page 11 for more
information on seasonality of sales see managements discussion and analysis 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations on page 18

     cost control we believe that our substantial buying power at the 100
price point contributes to our successful purchasing strategy which includes
disciplined targeted merchandise margin goals we believe our disciplined
buying and quality merchandise help to minimize markdowns we buy products on an
orderbyorder basis and have no material longterm purchase contracts or other
assurances of continued product supply or guaranteed product cost no vendor
accounted for more than 10 of total merchandise purchased in any of the last
five years

     we are currently upgrading our supply chain technology to better manage our
inventories the new systems implemented in this project will provide us with
valuable sales information to assist our buyers and improve merchandise
allocation to our stores controlling our inventory levels will result in more
efficient distribution and store operations

growth strategy
     store openings and square footage growth the primary factors contributing
to our net sales growth have been new store openings an active store expansion
program and selective mergers and acquisitions from 1997 to 2001 net sales
increased at a compound annual growth rate of 237 and operating income
excluding mergerrelated items increased at a compound annual growth rate of
224 we expect that the substantial majority of our future sales growth will
come from new store openings

     the following table shows the total selling square footage of our stores
and the selling square footage per new store opened over the last five years we
began opening larger stores after the acquisition of 98 cents clearance center
in 1998 our growth and productivity statistics will be reported based on
selling square footage prospectively because our management believes the use of
selling square footage yields a more accurate measure of store productivity the
selling square footage statistics for 1997 through 2000 are estimates based on
the relationship of selling to gross square footage

        1997             1059              3665               4055

        1998             1285              3790               3840

        1999             1507              4055               4765

        2000             1729              4520               6240

        2001             1975              5130               7070

     we expect to increase our selling square footage in the future by opening
new stores in underserved markets and strategically increasing our presence in
our existing markets via new store openings and store expansions expansions
include store relocations in 2002 and beyond we plan to predominately open
stores that are approximately 7000 to 10000 selling square feet we will also
continue to open stores ranging from 4000 to 6000 selling square feet as
opportunities arise stores of this size continue to offer strong storelevel
economics and allow us to optimize our strategic approach for a particular
market

     in addition to new store openings we plan to continue our store expansion
program to increase our net sales per store and take advantage of market
opportunities we target stores for expansion based on the current sales per
square foot and changes in market opportunities stores targeted for expansion
are generally less than 3500 selling square feet in size store expansions
generally increase the existing store size by approximately 3000 to 4000
selling square feet

     since 1995 we have added a total of 371 stores through three mergers and
several small acquisitions our acquisition strategy has been to target
companies with a similar single price point concept that have shown success in
operations or provide a strategic advantage we evaluate potential acquisition
opportunities in our retail sector as they become available

     merchandising and distribution expanding our customer base is important to
our growth plans we will continue to stock our new stores with the
everchanging merchandise that our current customers have come to appreciate in
addition we are opening larger stores that contain more basic consumable
merchandise to attract new customers consumable merchandise typically sells
faster than other merchandise which results in increased sales the
presentation and display of merchandise in our stores is critical to
communicating value to our customers and creating a more exciting shopping
experience we believe our approach to visual merchandising results in high
store traffic high sales volume and an environment that encourages impulse
purchases

     a strong and efficient distribution network is key to our ability to grow
and to maintain a lowcost operating structure we currently operate six
distribution centers which are capable of supporting approximately 30 billion
in annual sales we will continue to add distribution capacity to support our
store opening plans with the aim of remaining approximately one year ahead of
our distribution needs new distribution sites are strategically located to
reduce stem miles maintain flexibility and improve efficiency in our store
service areas

     our stores receive approximately 97 of their inventory from our six
distribution centers via contract carriers the remaining store inventory
primarily perishable consumable items and other vendormaintained display items
are delivered directly to our stores from vendors for more information on our
distribution center network see properties on page 7

     inventory supply chain beginning in 1999 we evaluated our inventory
supply chain processes to identify potential improvements as a result we
initiated a supply chain management project that encompasses four major
components

     o  planning for our merchandise purchasing

     o  purchasing merchandise and allocating that merchandise throughout our
        distribution and retail network

     o  obtaining current and detailed sales information from a group of
        representative stores using a pointofsale system and

     o  improving our ability to keep select merchandise in stock

     at december 31 2001 we operated pointofsale systems pos in 167 stores
and we plan to install pos in all new and expanded stores and convert some of
our existing  stores to pos in 2002  we expect to have pos  installed  in more
than 600 stores by the end of 2002 pointofsale data will allow us to track
sales by merchandise category and geographic region as well as assist in
planning for future purchases of inventory in addition we expect that
implementation of these initiatives will improve the efficiency of our supply
chain management improve our merchandise flow and help control costs

competition
     the retail industry is highly competitive and we expect competition to
increase in the future among fixed price point retailers the principal methods
of competition include convenience and the quality of merchandise offered to the
customer our competitors include variety and discount stores closeout stores
mass merchandisers and to a lesser extent other fixedprice point retailers
our competitors include family dollar dollar general and 99 cents only

trademarks
     we are the owners of federal service mark registrations for dollar tree
the dollar tree logo 1 dollar tree together with the related design and
one priceone dollar a small number of our stores operate under the name
only one dollar for which we have not obtained a service mark registration
we also own a concurrent use registration for dollar bill and the related
logo during 1997 we acquired the rights to use trade names previously owned by
everythings a dollar a former competitor in the 100 price point industry
several trade names were included in the purchase including the marks
everythings 100 we mean everything and everythings 100 the
registration of which is pending we also occasionally market products under
various private labels but these brand names are not material to our operations
with the acquisition of dollar express we became the owner of the service marks
dollar express and dollar expres

employees
     we employed approximately 8200 fulltime and 14500 parttime associates
on december 31 2001 the number of parttime associates fluctuates depending on
seasonal needs we consider our relationship with our associates to be good and
we have not experienced significant interruptions of operations due to labor
disagreements none of our employees are subject to collective bargaining
agreements

     we currently lease our stores and expect to continue to lease new stores as
we expand our leases typically provide for a short initial lease term
generally five years with options to extend we believe this leasing strategy
enhances our flexibility to pursue various expansion opportunities resulting
from changing market conditions


                                       7

     as current leases expire we believe that we will be able either to obtain
lease renewals if desired for present store locations or to obtain leases for
equivalent or better locations in the same general area to date we have not
experienced difficulty in either renewing leases for existing locations or
securing leases for suitable locations for new stores from time to time we may
not comply with certain provisions of our store operating leases we maintain
good relations with our landlords and believe that violation of these lease
provisions if any will not have a material effect on our operations

distribution centers
     the following table includes information about the distribution centers
that we currently operate we believe our operational distribution centers can
support a total of approximately 30 billion in annual sales

     savannah georgia               lease         march 2006          600000

we are planning to open a new distribution center in oklahoma in early to
mid2003 in addition to our distribution centers noted above during the past
several years we have used offsite facilities to accommodate limited quantities
of seasonal merchandise

     effective march 12 2001 we entered into an operating lease facility for
165 million of which 113 million was committed to our existing stockton
briar creek and savannah distribution centers the termination date of this
operating lease facility is march 12 2006 the lease facility among other
things requires the maintenance of certain specified financial ratios
restricts the payment of certain distributions and limits certain types of debt
we can incur

     except for our chicago facility each of our distribution centers contain
advanced materials handling technologies including an automated conveyor and
sorting system radiofrequency inventory tracking equipment and specialized
information systems we completed the expansion and automation of our stockton
distribution center in january 2002 this expansion increased the facility to a
total of 525000 square feet we have no plans to automate our existing chicago
distribution center

     since 1998 we have replaced four distribution centers for which we are
liable for future rents the leases on these facilities expire at various dates
through december 2009 we make every effort to sublease these facilities and
have subleased certain of the vacated facilities under agreements expiring at
various dates through june 2008

item 3  legal proceedings

     from time to time we are defendants in ordinary routine litigation and
proceedings incidental to our business including

     o  employment related matters

     o  product safety matters including product recalls by the consumer
        products safety commission and personal injury claims and

     o  the infringement of the intellectual property rights of others

     we have been sued by three salaried california employees who allege that
they should have been classified as nonexempt employees and therefore should
have received overtime compensation the suits also request that the california
state court certify the case as a class action on behalf of all store managers
assistant managers and merchandise managers in our california stores the
company will vigorously defend itself in this matter

     we do not believe that any of these matters are individually or in the
aggregate material to us

     we anticipate that all of our income in the foreseeable future will be
retained for the development and expansion of our business and the repayment of
indebtedness management does not anticipate paying dividends on our common
stock in the foreseeable future in addition our credit facilities contain
financial covenants that restrict our ability to pay cash dividends



item 7 managements  discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
     of operations

key events and recent developments
     several key events have had or are expected to have a significant effect on
our results of operations you should keep in mind that

     o  in january 2002 we completed the expansion and automation of our
        california distribution center which increased the size to 525000
        square feet

     o  in august 2001 we opened a new 600000 square foot automated
        distribution center in pennsylvania this new facility replaced our
        former distribution facilities in philadelphia pennsylvania

     o  in january 2001 we opened a new 600000 square foot automated
        distribution center in georgia

     o  in may 2000 we merged with dollar express and issued or reserved
        9000000 shares of our common stock in exchange for dollar expresss
        outstanding stock and options dollar express operated 132 stores
        primarily in the midatlantic region

     o  in january 2000 we opened a new 317000 square foot distribution
        center in california which replaced our sacramento california
        facility

     o  in june 1999 we merged with only one issuing 752400 shares of our
        common stock in exchange for only ones outstanding stock only one
        operated 24 stores in central and upstate new york

     o  in january 1999 we opened a new 425000 square foot distribution center
        in mississippi which replaced our memphis tennessee facility

     we accounted for the dollar express and only one mergers as poolings of
interest as a result all financial and operational data assume that dollar
express and only one had each been a part of dollar tree throughout all periods
presented for each period presented the outstanding dollar express and only
one shares of stock have been converted into dollar tree shares based on the
exchange ratios used in each merger

results of operations
     our net sales derive from the sale of merchandise two major factors tend
to affect our net sales trends first is our success at opening new stores or
adding new stores through mergers or acquisitions second sales may vary at our
existing stores from one year to the next we refer to this change as a change
in comparable store net sales because we compare only those stores that are
open throughout both of the periods being compared we include expanded stores
in the calculation of comparable store net sales which has the effect of
increasing our comparable store net sales the term expanded also includes
stores that are relocated

     most retailers have the ability to increase the price of their merchandise
in order to increase their comparable store net sales as a fixed price
retailer we do not have the ability to raise our prices generally our
comparable store net sales will increase only if we sell more merchandise our
plans for 2002 operations are based on comparable store net sales increases
between 0 and 2 but we are unable to predict actual comparable store net
sales in addition we expect net sales to increase approximately 18 in 2002

     we expect the substantial majority of our future net sales growth to come
from square footage growth resulting from new store openings and expansion of
existing stores in 2002 we plan to increase our selling square footage
approximately 25 or approximately 23 million square feet by adding 300 net
new stores and 04 million square feet by expanding approximately 100 stores we
expect the average size of new stores opened in 2002 to average approximately
7250 selling square feet per store in 2002 and beyond we plan to
predominately open stores that are approximately 7000 to 10000 selling square
feet we will also continue to open stores ranging from 4000 to 6000 selling
square feet as opportunities arise stores of this size continue to offer strong
storelevel economics and allow us to optimize our strategic approach for a
particular market while our newer larger stores have lower sales per square
foot than older smaller stores they generate higher sales and operating income
per store and create an improved shopping environment that invites customers to
shop longer and buy more

     we must control our merchandise costs inventory levels and our general and
administrative expenses increases in expenses could negatively impact our
operating results because we cannot pass on increased expenses to our customers
by increasing our merchandise price above the 100 price point



                                       11
page


     we will continue to experience pressure on our gross profit margins in
future years as we refine our merchandise mix to include a higher proportion of
consumable merchandise which typically carries a lower gross profit margin
open larger stores and continue to absorb higher costs we do expect to
partially offset the effect of the above factors with improved domestic freight
costs created by the addition of our two new distribution centers in 2001 even
with our changing merchandise mix we expect our gross profit margin will range
between 360 and 370 in the foreseeable future because we can vary the mix
among our consumable products and variety categories to impact our gross margin
in addition consumable merchandise typically sells more quickly than our other
merchandise resulting in increased sales

     leveraging our selling general and administrative expenses is difficult
because a substantial majority of our future sales growth is expected to come
primarily from new store openings rather than comparable store net sales

2001 compared to 2000
     net sales net sales increased 177 in 2001 compared to 2000 we attribute
this 2992 increase in net sales primarily to our new stores opened in 2001 and
2000 which are not included in our comparable store net sales results
comparable store net sales increased 01 in 2001

     we believe comparable store net sales remained relatively flat in 2001
because the retail environment in 2001 was unusually difficult in light of the
economic downturn and the events of september 11 2001 in addition our easter
selling season was shorter in 2001 compared to 2000 because easter was
approximately one week earlier in 2001 than 2000

     we opened 276 new stores and closed 30 stores during 2001 compared to 233
new stores opened and 11 stores closed in 2000 we added 296 to our selling
square footage in 2001 compared to 279 in 2000 of the 23 million or 296
increase in selling square footage in 2001 approximately 04 million selling
square feet was added by expanding 111 existing stores

     gross profit excluding 11 million of mergerrelated costs gross profit
margin decreased to 360 in 2001 compared to 370 in 2000 this decrease in
gross profit margin in 2001 was primarily due to loss of leverage on occupancy
costs and increases in shrink in the nowclosed philadelphia distribution
facilities

     selling general and administrative expenses excluding 33 million of
mergerrelated expenses in 2000 selling general and administrative expenses
increased as a percentage of net sales to 257 compared to 247 in 2000 this
increase is primarily the result of increases in payrollrelated costs
including insurance certain store operating expenses and charges recorded in
connection with our closed distribution facilities in philadelphia the increase
in payrollrelated costs and store operating expenses was primarily due to the
loss of leverage

     expressed as a percentage of net sales depreciation and amortization
increased to 27 in 2001 from 25 in 2000 a total increase of 118 million
the increase as a percent of net sales was due primarily to loss of leverage
the 118 million increase is due primarily to new stores and expansions in 2001
and to stores opened in 2000 being opened a full year in 2001

                                       12
page

     operating income due to the reasons discussed above excluding 44
million of mergerrelated items in 2000 operating income decreased to 2039
million in 2001 from 2074 million in 2000 and decreased as a percentage of net
sales to 103 from 123

     interest income and expense interest income decreased 07 million in 2001
compared to 2000 the decrease resulted primarily because of decreased interest
rates throughout 2001 interest expense decreased 24 million in 2001 compared
to 2000 this decrease was primarily due to the payoff of a revolving credit
facility and term loan in may 2000 we benefited slightly from the decrease in
variable interest rates in 2001 because of our variablerate operating leases
and variablerate debt however this benefit was partially offset as a result
of the interest rate swaps in effect during 2001

     income taxes our effective tax rate decreased to 385 for the year ended
december 31 2001 from 388 for the year ended december 31 2000 because 2000
included certain nondeductible mergerrelated expenses related to dollar
express

2000 compared to 1999
     net sales  net sales increased 249 in 2000 compared to 1999  we
attribute this 3363 million increase in net sales to two factors

     o  approximately 79 of the increase came from stores opened in 2000 and
        1999 which are not included in our comparable store net sales
        calculation

     o  approximately 21 of the increase came from comparable store net sales
        increases comparable store net sales increased 57 during 2000

we believe comparable store net sales increased in 2000 because we improved our
merchandise mix to offer more consumable products as a component of our domestic
merchandise and the easter selling season was longer in 2000 compared to 1999

     we opened 233 new stores and closed 11 stores during 2000 compared to 227
new stores opened and five stores closed in 1999 we added 279 to our selling
square footage in 2000 compared to 256 in 1999 of the 17 million or 279
increase in selling square footage in 2000 approximately 03 million selling
square feet was added by expanding 98 existing stores

     gross profit excluding 11 million of mergerrelated costs in 2000 gross
profit margin increased to 370 in 2000 compared to 368 in 1999 the increase
in gross margin in 2000 was primarily due to decreased merchandise costs
primarily as a result of our increased purchasing power and a slightly higher
percentage of import merchandise these savings were partially offset by
increased freight costs caused by increased domestic fuel costs and the higher
mix of consumable products as a percentage of our domestic merchandise

     selling general and administrative expenses excluding 33 million of
expenses related to the dollar express merger in 2000 selling general and
administrative expenses increased as a percentage of net sales to 247 compared
to 238 in 1999 this increase is primarily the result of a loss of leverage
during the important fourth quarter selling season nonrecurring dollar express
expenses of approximately 33 million and an increase in our workers
compensation and general liability accruals resulting from a change in our
estimates the 33 million in nonrecurring dollar express expenses primarily
includes

     o  accrual of tax liabilities
     o  training dollar express store personnel on new systems policies and
        procedures
     o  conducting physical inventories of dollar express stores and
     o  improving benefits and paying transitional salaries

     expressed as a percentage of net sales depreciation and amortization
increased to 25 in 2000 from 23 in 1999 a total increase of 112 million
the increase as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to approximately
14 million of accelerated depreciation related to dollar expresss store
equipment and warehouse management system we replaced the dollar express
warehouse management system in january 2001 with our own which we believe
increased the visibility of merchandise in our philadelphia distribution center
and improved merchandise flow and our store ordering system

     we estimate that dollar express was approximately 004 dilutive to our
diluted earnings per share in 2000 excluding mergerrelated items

     operating income due to the reasons discussed above excluding 44
million of mergerrelated items in 2000 operating income decreased as a
percentage of net sales to 123 from 131

page

     interest income and expense interest income increased 26 million in 2000
compared to 1999 the increase resulted from higher levels of cash and cash
equivalents in 2000 compared to 1999 interest expense increased 04 million in
2000 compared to 1999 interest expense increased because we incurred interest
on the saleleaseback transaction for the entire year in 2000 compared to only
three months in 1999 this increase was partially offset by the decrease in
interest on the revolving credit facility and term loan paid off in may 2000

     income taxes our effective tax rate increased to 388 for the year ended
december 31 2000 from 373 for the year ended december 31 1999 because the
1999 rate included a benefit of approximately 13 as a percentage of income
before taxes related to dollar expresss conversion from an s to c corporation
and 03 related to the nontaxable s corporation income of only one in the
first half of 1999

liquidity and capital resources

     our business requires capital to open new stores and operate existing
stores our working capital requirements for existing stores are seasonal and
usually reach their peak in september and october historically we have
satisfied our seasonal working capital requirements for existing stores and
funded our store opening and expansion programs from internally generated funds
and borrowings under our credit facilities

     the 714 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2001
was caused primarily by an approximate 728 million increase in working
capital



     cash used in investing activities is generally expended to open new stores
the 267 million increase in 2001 compared to 2000 in investing activities was
primarily due to the following

     o  we increased the number of new stores opened and the average size of
        those stores in 2001

     o  we expanded 111 stores in 2001 compared to 98 stores in 2000 while also
        increasing the size of those expanded stores

     o  we invested in technology to improve our supply chain processes

     the 111 million decrease in cash used in financing activities was
primarily the result of the following

     o  we made a 60 million principal payment on the senior notes in
        2001 in 2000 we made net repayments of approximately 342
        million due to repayment of dollar expresss term loan and
        revolving credit facility and the first principal payment on the
        senior notes

     o  we received 128 million less cash pursuant to stockbased
        compensation plans in 2001 compared to 2000 because of a decrease
        in the amount of stock option exercises which we believe resulted
        from the decreased stock price throughout 2001

     o  we paid 38 million in 2001 to repurchase shares in accordance
        with the securities and exchange commissions emergency relief
        order which has since expired

     at december 31 2001 our longterm borrowings were 370 million we had
500 million available through a revolving credit facility we also have 1250
million available under the letter of credit reimbursement and security
agreement of which approximately 681 million was committed to letters of
credit issued for routine purchases of imported merchandise

funding requirements

overview
     we plan to add approximately 300 net new stores in 2002 in 2001 the
average investment per new store including capital expenditures initial
inventory and preopening costs was approximately 360000

     we expect our cash needs for opening new stores in 2002 to total
approximately 1126 million which includes approximately 676 million for
capital expenditures and 450 million for initial inventory and preopening
costs in addition we expect to spend approximately 251 million to expand 100
stores in 2002 our total planned capital expenditures for 2002 are
approximately 1350 to 1400 million including planned expenditures for new
and expanded stores investments in our supply chain processes and additional
equipment for the distribution centers we believe that we can adequately fund
our planned capital expenditures and working capital requirements for the next
few years from net cash provided by operations and borrowings under our existing
credit facilities

commitments
     bank credit facilities effective march 12 2001 we entered into a
revolving credit facility with our banks which provides for a 500 million
unsecured revolving credit facility to be used for working capital bearing
interest at the agent banks prime rate or libor plus a spread at our option
the credit agreement among other things requires the maintenance of specified
ratios restricts the payments of certain distributions and limits certain types
of debt we can incur the facility was scheduled to terminate on march 11 2002
effective march 7 2002 we extended the revolving credit facility to may 31
2002

     also effective march 12 2001 we entered into a letter of credit
reimbursement and security agreement which provides 1250 million for letters
of credit which are generally issued for the routine purchase of imported
merchandise approximately 681 million was committed to letters of credit at
december 31 2001

     financial guarantee we have issued a guarantee for 200 million that is
used by one of our suppliers as collateral the guarantee is secured by letters
of credit totaling 200 million that expire in 2003

     freight contracts we have contracted outbound freight services from
various carriers with contracts expiring through august 2003 the total amount
of these commitments is approximately 126 million

     surety bonds we have issued various surety bonds totaling approximately
146 million that expire at various dates through 2003 the surety bonds
primarily serve as collateral on our large deductible insurance programs

lease facilities
     distribution center operating lease facility we have entered into
operating leases known as synthetic leases for three of our distribution
centers effective march 12 2001 we entered into an operating lease facility
with a group of financial institutions for 1650 million of which
approximately 1130 million is committed to our existing stockton briar creek
and savannah distribution centers the distribution centers are owned by a
special purpose entity under this type of agreement an unrelated third party
borrows funds under a construction agreement purchases the property pays for
the construction costs and subsequently leases the facility to us because these
arrangements are accounted for as operating leases the related fixed assets and
lease liabilities are not included on our balance sheet the termination date of
this operating lease facility is march 2006 at termination we must select from
one of the following alternatives

     o  we may purchase any or all of the distribution centers for the sum of
        the amounts due and outstanding under the lease and any costs and
        expenses incurred to exercise the purchase option approximately 1130
        million to purchase all distribution centers

     o  we may sell any or all of the distribution centers to a third party
        subject to a guarantee that the lessor will receive no less than 83 of
        the property cost plus any unpaid interest and rents under the lease
        agreement this obligation which could total as much as 928
        million is included in future operating lease commitments in 2006

     we have not yet determined what course of action we will take upon
termination of the existing facility however we believe it is unlikely that we
will vacate those distribution centers upon termination in 2006 we believe that
we will have sufficient cash or financing capabilities to execute one of the
available alternatives in addition we may be able to negotiate a new lease
term based on fair market values at the time of termination

     the lease facility among other things requires the maintenance of certain
specified financial ratios restricts the payment of certain distributions and
limits certain types of debt we can incur

     changes are currently being proposed to the current accounting for
synthetic leases which may make them less desirable in the future the proposed
changes in the required accounting for these transactions may adversely affect
our results of operations and our consolidated balance sheets

     saleleaseback transaction in september 1999 we sold some retail store
leasehold improvements to an unrelated third party and leased them back for
seven years we have an option to repurchase the leasehold improvements in
september 2004 and september 2006 at amounts approximating their fair market
values at the time the option is exercised the transaction is treated as a
financing arrangement for financial accounting purposes the total amount of the
lease obligation is 234 million we are required to make monthly lease
payments of 438000 in the first five years and 638000 in the sixth and
seventh years as a result of the transaction we received net cash of 209
million and an 81 million 110 note receivable which matures in september
2006 the amount of the lease obligation will equal the amount outstanding under
the note receivable in september 2006

longterm borrowings
     revenue bond financing in may 1998 we entered into an agreement with the
mississippi business finance corporation under which it issued 190 million of
variable rate demand revenue bonds we borrowed the proceeds from the bonds to
finance the acquisition construction and installation of land buildings
machinery and equipment for our new distribution facility in olive branch
mississippi at december 31 2001 the balance outstanding on the bonds was
190 million we begin repayment of the principal amount of the bonds in june
2006 with a portion maturing each june 1 until the final portion matures in
june 2018 the bonds do not have a prepayment penalty as long as the interest
rate remains variable the bonds contain a demand provision and therefore
outstanding amounts are classified as current liabilities we pay interest
monthly based on a variable interest rate which was 22 at december 31 2001
the bonds are secured by a 193 million letter of credit issued by one of our
existing lending banks the letter of credit is renewable annually the letter
of credit and reimbursement agreement require that we maintain specified
financial ratios and restrict our ability to pay cash dividends

     debt securities in april 1997 we issued 300 million of 729 unsecured
senior notes we used the proceeds to pay down a portion of the revolving credit
facility which enabled us to use that credit facility to fund capital
expenditures for the chesapeake corporate headquarters and distribution center
we pay interest on the notes semiannually on april 30 and october 30 each year
and we pay principal in five equal annual installments of 60 million which
began april 30 2000 the note holders have the right to require us to prepay
the notes in full without premium upon a change of control or upon specified
asset dispositions or other transactions we may make the note agreements
prohibit specified mergers and consolidations in which our company is not the
surviving company require that we maintain specified financial ratios require
that the notes rank on par with other debt and limit the amount of debt we can
incur in the event of default or a prepayment at our option we must pay a
penalty to the note holder

                                       16

derivative financial instruments
     derivative financial instruments we are party to four interest rate swaps
which allow us to manage the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations on
the demand revenue bonds and a portion of our variablerate operating leases
the swaps are based on notional amounts of 190 million 100 million 50
million and 250 million under the 190 million 100 million and 50
million agreements as amended we pay interest to the banks that provided the
swaps at a fixed rate in exchange the financial institution pays us at
variable interest rates which are similar to the rates on the demand revenue
bonds and our variablerate operating leases the variable interest rates on the
interest rate swaps are set monthly no payments are made by either party under
the swaps for monthly periods with an established interest rate greater than a
predetermined rate the knockout rate the swaps may be canceled by the bank
or us and settled for the fair value of the swap as determined by market rates

     the 250 million interest rate swap agreement is used to manage the risk
associated with interest rate fluctuations on a portion of our variablerate
operating leases under this agreement we pay interest to a financial
institution at a fixed rate of 543 in exchange the financial institution
pays us at a variable interest rate which approximates the floating rate on the
lease agreement excluding the credit spread the interest rate on the swap is
subject to adjustment monthly the swap is effective through march 2006 but it
may be canceled by the bank or us and settled for the fair value of the swap as
determined by market rates

     because of the knockout provision in the 190 million 100 million and
50 million interest rate swaps changes in the fair value of those swaps are
recorded currently in earnings changes in fair value on our 250 million
interest rate swap are recorded as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets because the swap
qualifies for hedge accounting treatment in accordance with statement of
financial accounting standards no 133 as amended by statement of financial
accounting standards no 138 the amounts recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income are subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same
period in which the related interest affects earnings

qualitative disclosures about market risk  interest rate risk on page 20

critical accounting policies

inventory valuation
     as discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements
inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or
market with cost determined on a firstin firstout fifo basis cost is
assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a fifo basis
under the retail inventory method the valuation of inventories at cost and the
resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated costtoretail
ratio to the retail value of inventories the retail inventory method is an
averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry and results in
valuing inventories at lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a
reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis

     inventory valuation methods require certain significant management
estimates and judgments these include estimates of merchandise markdowns and
shrink which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as
well as the resulting gross margins the averaging required in applying the
retail inventory method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns may under
certain circumstances result in inaccurate cost figures inaccurate inventory
cost may be caused by applying the retail inventory method to a group of
products that have differing characteristics related to gross margin and
turnover

     we estimate our markdown reserve based on the consideration of a variety of
factors including but not limited to quantities of slow moving or carryover
seasonal merchandise on hand historical markdown statistics and future
merchandising plans the accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many
factors some of which are outside of our control including changes in economic
conditions and consumer buying trends historically we have not experienced
significant differences in our estimates of markdowns compared with actual
results

     our accrual for shrink is based on the actual historical shrink results of
our most recent physical inventories adjusted if necessary for current
economic conditions these estimates are compared to actual results as physical
inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger the majority of
our counts are taken in the first and second quarters of each year therefore
the shrink accrual recorded at december 31 2001 is based on estimated shrink
for most of 2001 including the fourth quarter we have not experienced
significant fluctuations in historical shrink rates in our dollar tree stores
however we have sometimes experienced higher than typical shrink in acquired
stores in the year following an acquisition as was experienced in the former
dollar express distribution facilities and stores in 2001 we periodically
adjust our shrink estimates to address these factors as they become apparent

     our management believes that our application of the retail inventory method
results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results
in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market

                                       17
page

accrued expenses
     on a monthly basis we estimate certain material expenses in an effort to
record those expenses in the period incurred our most material estimates relate
to domestic freight insurancerelated expenses and certain store level
operating expenses such as property taxes and utilities our freight and
storelevel operating expenses are estimated based on current activity and
historical results our workers compensation and general liability insurance
accruals are recorded based on actuarial valuation methods performed by third
party actuaries these actuarial valuations are estimates based on historical
loss development factors differences in managements estimates and assumptions
could result in an accrual materially different from the calculated accrual

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations
     we experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales comparable store net
sales operating income and net income and expect this trend to continue our
results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety
of factors including

     o  shifts in the timing of certain holidays especially easter which may
        fall in different quarters from year to year

     o  the timing of new store openings

     o  the net sales contributed by new stores

     o  changes in our merchandise mix and

     o  competition

     our highest sales periods are the christmas and easter seasons easter was
observed on april 15 2001 and will be observed on march 31 2002 in addition
there will be six fewer selling days between thanksgiving and christmas in 2002
as compared to 2001 the decrease in the selling season results because of the
shift of thanksgiving from november 22 2001 to november 28 2002 we generally
realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and a substantial majority of
our operating and net income during the fourth quarter in anticipation of
increased sales activity during these months we purchase substantial amounts of
inventory and hire a significant number of temporary employees to supplement our
permanent store staff our operating results particularly operating and net
income could suffer if our net sales were below seasonal norms during the
fourth quarter or easter season for any reason including merchandise delivery
delays due to receiving or distribution problems historically net sales
operating income and net income have been weakest during the first quarter we
expect this trend to continue

     our unaudited results of operations for the eight most recent quarters are
shown in a table in footnote 11 of the consolidated financial statements in item
8 of this form 10k

inflation and other economic factors
     our ability to provide quality merchandise at a fixed price and on a
profitable basis may be subject to economic factors that we cannot control
including inflation in shipping rates wage rates and other operating costs

     shipping costs in the past we have experienced annual increases of as
much as 33 in our transpacific shipping rates due primarily to rate increases
imposed by the transpacific shipping cartel currently transpacific shipping
rates are negotiated with individual freight lines and are subject to
fluctuation based on supply and demand for containers as a result our
transpacific shipping rates may increase when we renegotiate our import
shipping rates effective may 2002

     during 2000 we experienced a 12 million increase in our domestic freight
costs because of increased domestic fuel costs during 2001 we experienced a
04 million increase in freight costs compared to 2000 resulting from increased
domestic fuel costs given the stabilization of fuel costs throughout 2001 we
do not expect fuel surcharges to materially affect our domestic freight costs in
2002

     we may experience disruptions in receiving shipments at our west coast
ports because of the possibility of a strike by the international longshore and
warehouse union beginning july 1 2002 the date their current labor agreement
expires we are formulating appropriate contingency plans to minimize the impact
that a strike could have on our receiving and distribution operations

                                       18
page

     minimum wage although our average hourly wage rate is significantly higher
than the federal minimum wage an increase in the mandated minimum wage could
significantly increase our payroll costs in february 2000 the us senate
approved a proposal increasing the federal minimum wage by 100 per hour over
three years in march 2000 the us house of representatives approved a
proposal increasing the federal minimum wage by 100 per hour over two years
no bill was passed into law and the status of this issue in the 2002 congress is
uncertain if the federal minimum wage were to increase by 100 per hour we
believe that our annual payroll expenses would increase by approximately 20 to
25 of operating expenses unless we realize offsetting cost reductions

     leases for replaced distribution centers we are liable for rent and
passthrough costs under leases for nowclosed distribution centers whose leases
expire at various dates through december 2009 annual rent and passthrough
costs on these facilities are approximately 32 million in 2002 22 million
in 2003 and 2004 20 in 2005 13 million in 2006 and 2007 10 million in
2008 and 07 million in 2009 certain of these distribution facilities have
been subleased under agreements expiring at various dates through june 2008 we
have recorded charges for these future obligations for certain of the facilities
considering current market conditions and probable sublease income at each
location

     unless offsetting cost savings are realized adverse economic factors
including inflation in operating costs could harm our financial condition and
results of operations

new accounting pronouncements

statements of financial accounting standards no 141 and 142
     statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 141 business
combinations requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all
business combinations initiated after june 30 2001

     sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets establishes
accounting standards for intangible assets and goodwill and is effective january
1 2002 sfas no 142 requires that goodwill and intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized but rather tested for impairment
at least annually sfas no 142 will also require that intangible assets with
definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives
and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 144 accounting for the
impairment or disposal of longlived assets application of the
nonamortization provisions of sfas no 142 is expected to result in a reduction
in amortization expense of approximately 20 million per year we performed the
first of the required impairment tests of goodwill as of january 1 2002 to
evaluate existing goodwill for impairment upon adoption of sfas no 142 based
on the transition impairment tests performed on recorded goodwill and other
intangibles we will not record a cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle in connection with the adoption of the provisions of this standard

statement of financial accounting standards no 143
   in june 2001 the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 143
accounting for asset retirement obligations which addresses financial
accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of
tangible longlived assets and the associated asset retirement costs the
standard applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of
longlived assets that result from the acquisition construction development
andor normal use of the asset sfas no 143 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after june 15 2002 our management does not believe the
implementation of this standard will have a material effect on our financial
condition or results of operations

statement of financial accounting standards no 144
     in august 2001 the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no
144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets which
requires that longlived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not
be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a
comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected
to be generated by the asset if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its
estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by
which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset sfas
no 144 requires companies to separately report discontinued operations and
extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed
of by sale abandonment or in a distribution to owners or is classified as
held for sale assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the
carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell sfas no 144 supersedes sfas
no 121 accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and for longlived
assets to be disposed of sfas no 144 is effective beginning january 1 2002
our management does not believe the implementation of this standard will have a
material effect on our financial condition or results of operations

item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

     we are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of our
business including the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency
rate fluctuations we may enter into interest rate swaps to manage exposure to
interest rate changes and we may employ other risk management strategies
including the use of foreign currency forward contracts we do not enter into
derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging purposes and
we do not hold derivative instruments for trading purposes

interest rate risk
     we have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk
consisting of debt and lease obligations issued at variable and fixed rates
based on amounts outstanding on our fixed rate debt obligations at december 31
2001 we do not consider our exposure to interest rate risk to be material

     we use variablerate debt and variablerate operating leases to finance
certain of our operations and capital improvements these obligations expose us
to variability in interest and rent payments due to changes in interest rates
if interest rates increase interest andor rent expense increase conversely
if interest rates decrease interest andor rent expense also decrease we
believe it is beneficial to limit the variability of our interest and rent
payments

     to meet this objective we entered into derivative instruments in the form
of interest rate swaps to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from
changes in the variable interest rates on the obligations the interest rate
swaps reduce the interest rate exposure on these variablerate obligations
under the interest rate swap we pay the bank at a fixed rate and receive
variable interest at a rate approximating the variable rate on the obligation
thereby creating the economic equivalent of a fixed rate obligation under the
190 million 100 million and 50 million interest rate swaps no payments
are made by parties under the swaps for monthly periods in which the variable
interest rate is greater than the predetermined knockout rate



     the following table summarizes the financial terms of our interest rate

hypothetically a 1 change in interest rates results in approximately a 06
million change in the amount paid or received under the terms of the interest
rate swap agreements on an annual basis due to many factors management is not
able to predict the changes in fair value of our interest rate swaps the fair
values are the estimated amounts we would pay or receive to terminate the
agreements as of the reporting date these fair values are obtained from an
outside financial institution

foreign currency risk
     although we purchase most of our imported goods with us dollars we are
subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to payments to suppliers
in euros formerly italian lire when favorable exchange rates exist we may
hedge foreign currency commitments of future payments by purchasing foreign
currency forward contracts on december 31 2001 we had no contracts
outstanding less than 1 of our purchases are contracted in euros and the
market risk exposure relating to currency exchange rate fluctuations is not
material

item 1  business

overview

     macon brock our president and chief executive officer doug perry our
chairman and ray compton our executive vice president started dollar tree in
1986 we are the leading operator of discount variety stores offering
merchandise at the fixed price of 100 we believe the variety and quality of
products we sell for 100 set us apart from our competitors in each of the
last three years we added over 220 stores as of december 31 2000 we operated
1729 stores totaling 98 million gross square feet in 36 states

     o    1327 are our traditional dollar stores generally ranging from 3500
          to 6000 gross square feet

     o    378 are larger dollar stores generally ranging from 7000 to 12000
          gross square feet and

     o    24 are multiprice point card and gift stores generally ranging from
          3000 to 5000 gross square feet

     during 2000 we merged with dollar express inc which operated 132 stores
in the midatlantic area of the stores acquired 107 were 100 singleprice
point stores operated as dollar express and 25 were multiprice point stores
operated as spains cards  gifts

     our singleprice point stores range from 2000 to 23000 total square feet
and operate under the names of dollar tree dollar express dollar bills only
one dollar and only one the singleprice point stores are generally segregated
into two groups stores less than 7000 gross square feet which we refer to as
our traditional stores and stores 7000 gross square feet or greater which we
refer to as our larger format stores our multiprice point stores operate under
the name spains cards  gifts and represent less than 1 of total net sales

business strategy

     value offering we strive to exceed our customers expectations of the
variety and quality of products that can be purchased for 100 we believe that
many of the items we sell for 100 are typically sold for higher prices
elsewhere we purchase a portion of our products directly from foreign
manufacturers allowing us to pass on additional value to the customer in
addition direct relationships with both domestic and foreign manufacturers
permit us to select a broad product range customize packaging and frequently
obtain larger product sizes and higher package quantities


                                       4

     changing merchandise mix we supplement our wide assortment of quality
everyday core merchandise and consumable products with a changing mix of new and
exciting products including seasonal goods such as easter gifts summer toys
and halloween and christmas decorations we also take advantage of the
availability of lowerpriced privatelabel and regional brand goods which we
believe are comparable to national name brands we continually change the mix of
seasonal merchandise nonseasonal merchandise and consumable products to add
variety and freshness to our merchandise offerings

     convenient highly visible store locations we locate our stores in areas
convenient to customers we prefer opening new stores in strip shopping centers
anchored by strong mass merchandisers such as wal mart kmart and target whose
target customers we believe to be similar to ours we also open stores in
neighborhood centers anchored by large grocery retailers we believe that our
stores bright lighting and curb appeal attract new and repeat customers and
enhance our image as both a destination and impulse store

     strong and consistent store level economics our stores have been
successful in major metropolitan areas midsized cities and small towns since
1994 all stores opened under the dollar tree name have been profitable
producing storelevel operating income within the first full year of operation

     cost control given our fixed 100 price structure we must control
expenses inventory levels and operating margins to be successful we closely
monitor both retail inventory shrinkage and retail markdowns of inventory
neither exceeded 25 of annual net sales in each year from 1996 through 1999
excluding the dollar express operations in 2000 inventory shrinkage slightly
exceeded 25 while markdowns of inventory remained below 25 as part of our
effort to control expenses we generally do not advertise and we accept credit
and debit cards in only 10 to 15 of our stores in the past five calendar
years excluding mergerrelated items we have maintained our gross profit
margins in the 346 to 370 range and our operating income margins in the
104 to 131 range

growth strategy

     the primary factors contributing to our net sales growth have been new
store openings comparable store net sales increases and mergers and
acquisitions from 1996 to 2000 net sales increased at a compound annual growth
rate of 262 and operating income excluding mergerrelated items increased at
a compound annual growth rate of 317 we expect that future sales growth will
come primarily from new store openings and to a lesser degree from comparable
store net sales increases including those attributable to expanded and
relocated stores we expect to open approximately 260 to 275 new stores and
close 10 to 15 stores in 2001 and we expect our total gross square footage to
increase 27 to 29 we expect net sales to increase approximately 19 in 2001
as compared to 2000 our expected net sales increase is less than our gross
square footage increase because net sales per gross square foot will decrease as
we open more of our larger format stores also continued difficult economic and
consumer related conditions may likely reduce our net sales increases our store
openings will continue to be concentrated within our existing markets to take
advantage of market opportunities distribution efficiencies and field
management efficiencies in addition we also plan to enter selected new
geographic markets

     we plan to continue our store expansion and relocation program to increase
net sales per store and take advantage of market opportunities in 2000 we
added approximately 401000 gross square feet by expanding or relocating 98
stores in 2001 we plan to expand or relocate approximately 100 stores adding
approximately 400000 gross square feet we target stores for expansion and
relocation based on the current sales per square foot and changes in market
opportunities stores targeted for relocation in 2001 are generally stores in
the 2500 to 3000 square foot range

     we have experienced significant sales growth over the last five years
managing our growth has become more complex because we are now operating over
1700 stores in 36 states from coast to coast we may not anticipate all the
challenges that our expanding operations will impose on our systems our sales
growth and profitability depends on our ability to increase our total store
square footage and the capacity of our store support systems in a profitable
timely and efficient manner to meet our aggressive growth plans we must supply
an increasing number of stores with the proper mix and volume of merchandise
successfully add and operate larger stores hire train and retain an increasing
number of qualified employees open suitable store sites and expand and upgrade
our distribution centers and internal store support systems on a tight time
schedule we may not meet our targets for opening new stores and expanding
profitably


                                       5
page


     in the past five years we added a total of 371 stores through three large
mergers and several small acquisitions our acquisition strategy has been to
target companies with a similar single price point concept that have shown
success in operations or provide a strategic advantage although we do not have
any current plans regarding potential acquisitions we may evaluate
opportunities in our retail sector as they become available

site selection and store size

     we maintain a disciplined costsensitive approach to store site selection
favoring strip shopping centers since 1995 we have opened stores primarily in
strip shopping centers these stores typically require lower initial capital
investments and generate higher operating margins than mall stores our stores
have been successful in metropolitan areas midsized cities and small towns we
believe that our stores have a relatively small shopping radius which allows us
to profitably concentrate multiple stores in a single market our ability to
open new stores is dependent upon among other factors locating suitable sites
and negotiating favorable lease terms

     we operate stores primarily ranging from 3500 to 6000 gross square feet
in addition to opening our traditional stores we continue to open more of our
larger stores which generally range from 7000 to 12000 gross square feet
stores with at least 7000 gross square feet account for approximately 22 of
our store base as of december 31 2000 we expect to open 165 to 175 of these
larger stores during 2001 the range of our store sizes allows us to target a
particular location with a store that best suits that market we view the
development of these larger stores as a continuation of our core business

     for more information on retail locations and retail store leases see
properties on page 8

merchandising and store format

     merchandise mix our stores offer a wide selection of core and changing
products within traditional variety store categories including candy and food
housewares seasonal goods health and beauty care toys party goods gifts
stationery and other consumer items the actual items and brands offered at any
one time will vary we have a core selection of consumable products such as
household chemicals paper and plastics candy and food and health and beauty
care products that we target to have in stock at our stores continuously these
products are generally available yearround in our distribution facilities for
stores to reorder as needed our larger stores carry a greater variety and
quantity of consumable products than our smaller stores particularly food
household chemicals and health and beauty care products

     we sell seasonal and impulse items and selected closeout merchandise to add
variety and freshness to our core products and create an exciting shopping
experience examples of seasonal goods include easter gifts summer toys and
halloween and christmas decorations we also offer namebrand closeout
merchandise to supplement our merchandise mix in 2000 closeout merchandise
represented less than 10 of our purchases and we would generally not expect it
to exceed 15 we also sell private label and regional brand goods that we
believe are comparable in quality but priced lower than similar goods with
national name brands

     purchasing we believe that our substantial buying power at the 100 price
point contributes to our successful purchasing strategy which includes
disciplined targeted merchandise margin goals we purchase merchandise from
manufacturers trading companies and brokers no vendor accounted for more than
10 of total merchandise purchased in any of the last five years we frequently
use new vendors to offer competitive yet varied product selection and high
value we buy products on an orderbyorder basis and have no material longterm
purchase contracts or other assurances of continued product supply or guaranteed
product cost

     our purchasing strategy balances imported merchandise and domestic
products we believe imported merchandise and domestic products each currently
account for approximately onehalf of our purchases our domestic products
include namebrand merchandise from manufacturers like hersheys and procter 
gamble and a variety of consumable products housewares and paper and plastic
goods our domestic purchasing program has evolved over the past few years to
include direct relationships with major manufacturers such as colgate and
unilever merchandise imported directly from overseas manufacturers and agents
accounts for approximately 40 to 45 of total purchases at retail in addition
we believe that a small portion of the goods we purchase from domestic vendors
is imported while we do not expect to increase imports significantly as a
percentage of our merchandise our future success depends on the continuing
availability of imported merchandise at favorable costs


                                       6
page


     if chinese or other imported merchandise becomes more expensive or
unavailable the transition to alternative sources which may be of lesser
quality and more expensive may not occur in time to meet our demands a
disruption in the flow of our imported merchandise or an increase in the cost of
this merchandise may significantly decrease our net sales and profits on
october 10 2000 the united states granted permanent normal trade relations to
china even with permanent normal trade relations the united states could
impose punitive trade sanctions on chinese goods for a variety of reasons
although no punitive import duties are currently imposed in the past the
united states trade representative has threatened retaliatory sanctions equaling
as much as 100 of the cost of some chinese goods

     visual merchandising the presentation and display of merchandise in our
stores is critical to communicating value to our customers and creating a more
exciting shopping experience our stores are attractively designed and create an
inviting atmosphere for shoppers by using bright lighting vibrant colors
uniform decorative signs carpeting and background music our merchandise
fixtures include gondola shelving slat walls bins and adjustable gift
displays allowing us the flexibility to rearrange merchandise to feature
seasonal products some of these fixtures have been specifically designed for
us such as a customized shelf display promoting our polyresin and porcelain
gift products our field merchandising group including regional merchandise
managers and store display coordinators maintains a consistent visual
presentation of merchandise throughout our stores we believe that our approach
to visual merchandising results in high store traffic high sales volume and an
environment that encourages impulse purchases we rely on attractive exterior
signs and instore merchandising for our advertising we generally do not use
other forms of advertising except in limited cases when promoting the opening
of a new store

     during 1999 we converted our 98 cent clearance center stores to more
closely resemble existing dollar tree stores including changing all but one
store name to dollar tree during 2000 we converted 20 of the 24 only one
stores added in 1999 these conversions included installing new checkouts and
display fixtures and improving store layouts and merchandise displays at all
only one stores and changing the name from only one to dollar tree at select
stores during 2000 we added shelving and display fixtures and we improved
store layouts and merchandise displays in 11 of the dollar express stores
during the first three quarters of 2001 we expect to upgrade 65 to 70 of the
dollar express stores by adding display fixtures improving store layouts and
merchandise displays installing new signs installing new checkouts in some of
the stores and changing each store name to dollar tree

merchandise receiving and distribution

     merchandise receiving and distribution are managed centrally from our
corporate headquarters located on the same site as our chesapeake virginia
distribution center maintaining a strong receiving and distribution system is
critical to our expansion and ability to maintain a low cost operating
structure

     substantially all of our inventory is shipped or picked up directly from
suppliers and delivered to our distribution centers where the inventory is
processed and then distributed to our stores the majority of our inventory is
delivered to the stores by contract carriers we also make deliveries to some of
our stores using our fleet of trucks most stores receive weekly shipments of
merchandise from distribution centers based on their anticipated inventory
requirements for that week we also make more frequent deliveries to some
stores including most dollar express stores many of our dollar tree stores
require more frequent deliveries during the busy christmas season for more
information on our distribution center network see properties on page 8

inventory supply chain

     beginning in 1999 we evaluated our inventory supply chain processes to
identify potential improvements as a result we initiated a supply chain
management project that encompasses four major components

     o    planning for our merchandise purchasing

     o    purchasing merchandise and allocating that merchandise throughout our
          distribution and retail network

     o    obtaining current and detailed sales information from a group of
          representative stores using a pointofsale system and

     o    improving our ability to keep select merchandise in stock

     we believe the implementation of this project will improve the efficiency
of our supply chain management improve our merchandise flow and help control
costs


                                       7
page


     in the first half of 2001 we will begin to test our pointofsale system
in approximately 10 stores we then plan to install pointofsale in up to 300
of our stores within approximately 12 months after we complete the test phase
we expect that the pointofsale data will allow us to track sales by
merchandise category and geographic region and assist our planning for future
purchases of inventory our supply chain management project is expected to cost
approximately 230 to 260 million in total of which approximately 85
million was expended through december 31 2000

competition

     the retail industry is highly competitive and we expect competition to
increase in the future our competitors include variety and discount stores such
as dollar general closeout stores such as odd lots and big lots mass
merchandisers such as wal mart and to a lesser extent other fixed price
retailers we expect that our expansion plans as well as the expansion plans of
other fixed price retailers such as 99 cents only stores based in southern
california will increasingly bring us into direct competition competition may
also increase because there are no significant economic barriers to other
companies becoming fixed price retailers

trademarks

     we are the owners of federal service mark registrations for dollar tree
the dollar tree logo 1 dollar tree together with the related design and
one priceone dollar a small number of our stores operate under the name
only one dollar for which we have not obtained a service mark registration
we also own a concurrent use registration for dollar bill and the related
logo during 1997 we acquired the rights to use trade names previously owned by
everythings a dollar a former competitor in the 100 price point industry
several trade names were included in the purchase including the marks
everythings 100 we mean everything everythings 100 the registration
of which is pending and the dollar store with the acquisition of the only
one stores in 1999 we became the owner of additional federal service mark
registrations including only one 1 and the stylized only one together
with the related design we also occasionally market products under various
private labels but these brand names are not material to our operations with
the acquisition of dollar express we became the owner of the service marks
dollar express and dollar expres

seasonality

     historically we have experienced seasonal fluctuation in our net sales
operating income and net income we expect this trend to continue see
managements discussion and analysis  seasonality and quarterly fluctuations
on page 20

employees

     we employed approximately 6700 fulltime and 19500 parttime associates
on december 31 2000 the number of parttime associates fluctuates depending on
seasonal needs except the truck drivers for the philadelphia distribution
center none of our associates are represented by a labor union the teamsters
have attempted to organize our associates at our chesapeake chicago and
philadelphia distribution centers on several occasions and we expect their
efforts to continue we consider our relationship with our associates to be
good and we have not experienced significant interruptions of operations due to
labor disagreements

     as of december 31 2000 we operated 1729 stores in 36 states the

     our stores in the west average approximately 12400 gross square feet
compared to our other stores which average approximately 5200 gross square
feet

     we currently lease our existing stores and expect this policy to continue
as we expand our leases typically provide for a short initial lease term and
give us the option to extend we believe this leasing strategy enhances our
flexibility to pursue various expansion and relocation opportunities resulting
from changing market conditions

     as current leases expire we believe that we will be able either to obtain
lease renewals if desired for present store locations or to obtain leases for
equivalent or better locations in the same general area to date we have not
experienced difficulty in either renewing leases for existing locations or
securing leases for suitable locations for new stores many of our leases
contain provisions with which we do not comply including provisions requiring
us to advertise or insure store property prohibiting us from operating another
store within a specified radius and restricting the sale of leasehold
improvements we believe that the violation of these provisions will not have a
material adverse effect on our business or financial position because we
generally maintain good relations with our landlords and are a valued tenant

distribution centers

     the following table includes information about the distribution centers
that we currently operate we believe our operational distribution centers can
support a total of approximately 23 billion in annual retail sales

                                                                      size in

     in addition to our distribution centers noted above during the past
several years we have used offsite facilities to accommodate large quantities
of seasonal merchandise

     we have leased a 600000 square foot distribution center being constructed
in briar creek pennsylvania we expect it to be operational in early 2002 we
believe that when this new facility is fully operational our distribution
network will support annual sales up to 29 billion the briar creek
distribution center will replace our philadelphia distribution center and 83000
square foot office and warehouse the lease for which expires in april 2001
when the lease expires the office and warehouse facility will be leased on a
monthtomonth basis until the briar creek distribution center is operational

     effective march 12 2001 we entered into an operating lease facility for
165 million of which 93 million was committed to our existing stockton briar
creek and savannah distribution centers our existing distribution center
operating lease agreements for stockton briar creek and savannah were replaced
with this facility the termination date of this operating lease facility is
march 12 2006 as a result the lease expiration date for the stockton briar
creek and savannah distribution centers is now march 12 2006 the lease
facility among other things requires the maintenance of certain specified
financial ratios restricts the payment of certain distributions and limits
certain types of debt we can incur

     the chesapeake olive branch and savannah distribution centers contain and
the briar creek distribution center will contain advanced materials handling
technologies including an automated conveyor and sorting system
radiofrequency inventory tracking equipment and specialized information
systems beginning in march 2001 we plan to expand and automate the stockton
distribution center the automation and expansion is expected to be complete in
the first quarter of 2002 and will increase the facility to 525000 square feet
the chicago and philadelphia distribution centers are not automated and there
are no plans to automate these facilities

item 3  legal proceedings

     we are defendants in ordinary routine litigation and proceedings incidental
to our business from time to time the consumer products safety commission
requires us to recall products we are currently in the process of recalling one
product on several occasions products we sold have been alleged to cause
injuries but there are no pending or threatened injury claims some products we
sold have also been alleged to infringe the intellectual property rights of
others we are currently defending claims by parties who have alleged that

item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
         of operations

key events and recent developments

     several key events have had or are expected to have a significant effect on
our results of operations you should keep in mind that

     o    in august 2000 we amended an existing distribution center operating
          lease agreement to facilitate construction of a 600000 square foot
          distribution center in briar creek pennsylvania we plan to begin
          operating this facility in the first quarter of 2002

     o    in may 2000 we merged with dollar express and issued or reserved
          9000000 shares of our common stock in exchange for dollar expresss
          outstanding stock and options dollar express operated 132 stores
          primarily in the midatlantic region

     o    in january 2000 we entered into an operating lease for a new 600000
          square foot distribution center which was constructed in savannah
          georgia we began shipping from this facility in february 2001

     o    also in january 2000 we opened a new 317000 square foot distribution
          center in stockton california which replaced our sacramento
          california facility

     o    in june 1999 we merged with only one issuing 752400 shares of our
          common stock in exchange for only ones outstanding stock only one
          operated 24 stores in central and upstate new york

     o    in january 1999 we opened a new 425000 square foot distribution
          center in olive branch mississippi which replaced our memphis
          tennessee facility

     o    in december 1998 we merged with 98 cent clearance center we reserved
          or issued approximately 3228000 shares of our common stock in
          exchange for 98 cent clearance centers outstanding stock and options
          98 cent clearance center operated 66 stores in northern and central
          california and nevada

     we accounted for the dollar express only one and 98 cent clearance center
mergers as poolings of interest as a result all financial and operational data
assume that dollar express only one and 98 cent clearance center had each been
a part of dollar tree throughout all periods presented for each period
presented the outstanding dollar express only one and 98 cent clearance
center shares of stock have been converted into dollar tree shares based on the
exchange ratios used in each merger

results of operations

     our net sales derive from the sale of merchandise two major factors tend
to affect our net sales trends first is our success at opening new stores or
adding new stores through mergers or acquisitions second sales change at our
existing stores from one year to the next we refer to this as a change in
comparable store net sales because we compare only those stores that are open
throughout both of the periods being compared we include expanded or relocated
stores in the calculation of comparable store net sales which causes our
comparable store net sales increases or decreases to appear more favorable

     most retailers can increase the price of their merchandise in order to
increase their comparable store net sales as a fixed price retailer we do not
have the ability to raise our prices generally our comparable store net sales
will increase only if we sell more merchandise in 1999 we increased the price
point in the sixtysix 98 cent clearance center stores from 098 to 100 this
had only a minor impact on our comparable store net sales we believe that
future comparable store net sales increases if any will be lower than those we
have experienced in the past

     we anticipate that our future net sales growth will come mostly from new
store openings we added 222 stores in 2000 and plan to add 250 to 260 stores in
2001 we also expect our average store size to increase in 2001 which we
believe will result in a decrease in our net sales per gross square foot of our
expected gross square footage increase in 2001 of 27 to 29 or 26 million to
28 million gross square feet approximately 400000 square feet will come from
expanded or relocated stores

     increases in expenses could negatively impact our operating results because
we cannot pass on increased expenses to our customers by increasing our
merchandise price consequently our future success depends in large part on our
ability to control our costs

2000 compared to 1999

     net sales net sales increased 249 to 16881 million for 2000 from
13518 million for 1999 we attribute this 3363 million increase in net
sales to two factors

     o    approximately 79 of the increase came from stores opened in 2000 and
          1999 which are not included in our comparable store net sales
          calculation

     o    approximately 21 of the increase came from comparable store net sales
          increases comparable store net sales increased 57 during 2000

we believe comparable store net sales increased because

     o    we expanded and relocated stores

     o    we improved the mix of our merchandise offering more consumable
          products as a component of our domestic merchandise

     o    the easter selling season was longer in 2000 compared to 1999

     o    customers purchased a higher average number of items per visit and we
          had more customer visits

     we opened 233 new stores and closed 11 stores during 2000 compared to 227
new stores opened and five stores closed the previous year we added 287 to
our total store square footage in 2000 compared to 262 in 1999 of the 22
million or 287 increase in gross square footage in 2000 approximately
400000 gross square feet was added by expanding and relocating existing stores

     gross profit gross profit increased 1263 million or 254 in 2000 as
compared to our gross profit in 1999 our gross profit margin increased to 369
in 2000 from 368 in 1999 excluding mergerrelated costs gross profit margin
increased to 370 in 2000 compared to 368 in 1999 particular changes
affecting our gross profit margin in 2000 included

     o    we believe our buying power with merchandise vendors increased because
          of our increased sales which in turn lowered our overall merchandise
          costs expressed as a percentage of net sales

     o    our freight costs increased primarily as a result of our changing
          merchandise mix and an increase in domestic fuel costs the changing
          merchandise mix which included an increase in consumable merchandise
          as a percentage of our domestic merchandise required more shipments
          to deliver the same amount of merchandise in 2000 as compared to 1999


                                       14
page

     o    in 2000 we purchased a slightly higher percentage of imports which
          generally cost less than domestic products and sales of these goods
          improved our gross profit margin for the year

     we will have difficulty maintaining our historical gross profit margins in
2001 and future years as we refine our merchandise mix to include a higher
proportion of consumable merchandise which typically carry a lower gross profit
margin open more of the larger stores and continue to absorb higher costs

     selling general and administrative expenses selling general and
administrative expenses increased 989 million or 307 in 2000 compared to
1999 as a percentage of net sales selling general and administrative expenses
increased to 249 in 2000 compared to 238 in 1999 excluding expenses related
to the dollar express merger in 2000 selling general and administrative
expenses increased as a percentage of net sales to 247 compared to 238 in
1999 this increase is primarily the result of a loss of leverage during the
important fourth quarter selling season nonrecurring dollar express expenses
of approximately 33 million and an increase in our workers compensation and
general liability accruals resulting from a change in our estimates the 33
million in nonrecurring dollar express expenses primarily includes

     o    accrual of tax liabilities
     o    training dollar express store personnel on new systems policies and
          procedures
     o    conducting physical inventories of dollar express stores and
     o    improving benefits and paying transitional salaries

     expressed as a percentage of net sales depreciation and amortization
increased to 25 in 2000 from 23 in 1999 a total increase of 112 million
the increase as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to approximately
14 million of accelerated depreciation related to dollar expresss store
equipment and warehouse management system we replaced the dollar express
warehouse management system in january 2001 with our own which we believe will
increase the visibility of merchandise in our philadelphia distribution center
and improve merchandise flow and our store ordering system

     we estimate that dollar express was approximately 004 dilutive to our
diluted earnings per share in 2000 excluding mergerrelated items

     leveraging our selling general and administrative expenses will become
increasingly difficult because we expect to incur difficulties in maintaining
our historical comparable store net sales increases especially in the first
half of 2001

     operating income our operating income increased 274 million or 156
in 2000 as compared to 1999 as a percentage of net sales operating income
decreased to 120 in 2000 compared to 130 in 1999 excluding mergerrelated
items operating income increased to 2074 million in 2000 from 1766 million
in 1999 and decreased as a percentage of net sales to 123 from 131 this
decrease was due to increased operating expenses as a percentage of net sales
partially offset by improved gross profit margin as discussed above

     interest income and expense interest income increased 26 million to 43
million in 2000 from 17 million in 1999 the increase resulted from higher
levels of cash and cash equivalents in 2000 compared to 1999 interest expense
increased 04 million to 78 million in 2000 from 74 million in 1999
interest expense increased because we incurred interest on the saleleaseback
transaction for the entire year in 2000 compared to only three months in 1999
this increase was partially offset by the decrease in interest on the revolving
credit facility and term loan paid off in may 2000

     income taxes our effective tax rate increased to 388 for the year ended
december 31 2000 from 373 for the year ended december 31 1999 because the
1999 rate included a benefit of approximately 13 as a percentage of income
before taxes related to dollar expresss conversion from an s to c corporation
and 03 related to the nontaxable s corporation income of only one in the
first half of 1999

1999 compared to 1998

     net sales net sales increased 259 to 13518 million for 1999 from
10739 million for 1998 we attribute this 2779 million increase in net
sales to two factors

     o    approximately 82 of the increase came from stores opened in 1999 and
          1998 which are not included in our comparable store net sales
          calculation

     o    approximately 18 of the increase came from comparable store net sales
          growth comparable store net sales increased 50 during 1999

                                       15
page

we believe comparable store net sales increased because

     o    we improved the mix of our merchandise with a slightly higher
          emphasis on consumable products

     o    throughout 1999 we changed the merchandise mix at the 98 cent
          clearance center stores to more closely resemble the mix at our
          existing dollar tree stores

     o    we expanded and relocated stores

     o    customers purchased a higher average number of items per visit and we
          had more customer visits

     we opened 227 new stores and closed five stores during 1999 compared to
234 new stores opened and eight stores closed the previous year the new 1999
stores include four that we acquired from a small dollar store operator we
added 262 to our total square footage in each of 1999 and 1998

     gross profit gross profit increased 1061 million or 271 in 1999 as
compared to our gross profit in 1998 our gross profit margin increased to 368
in 1999 from 364 in 1998 particular changes affecting our gross profit margin
in 1999 included

     o    we believe our buying power with merchandise vendors increased because
          of our increased sales which in turn lowered our overall merchandise
          costs expressed as a percentage of net sales

     o    our distribution costs were lower as a percentage of net sales due to
          efficiencies at our chesapeake and olive branch distribution centers

     o    we experienced higher freight costs because of the increase in the
          transpacific shipping rates that took effect in may 1999 excluding
          the effect on dollar express we estimate that the impact of these
          higher shipping rates on our business was approximately 50 million
          in 1999

     o    in 1999 we purchased a slightly higher percentage of imports which
          generally cost less than domestic products and sales of these goods
          improved our gross profit margin for the year

     selling general and administrative expenses selling general and
administrative expenses increased 610 million or 234 in 1999 compared to
1998 as a percentage of net sales selling general and administrative expenses
decreased to 238 in 1999 compared to 242 in 1998 excluding expenses related
to the 98 cent clearance center merger in 1998 selling general and
administrative expenses remained constant as a percentage of net sales at 238
in both 1999 and 1998 expressed as a percentage of net sales depreciation and
amortization increased to 23 in 1999 from 20 in 1998 a total increase of
83 million this percentage increase resulted primarily from depreciation
related to the olive branch distribution facility

     during 1999 we recorded a 13 million charge in selling general and
administrative expenses for remaining payments on our closed sacramento
distribution facility this lease loss accrual is adjusted quarterly based on
changes in market conditions

     operating income our operating income increased 451 million or 345
in 1999 as compared to 1998 as a percentage of net sales operating income
increased to 130 in 1999 compared to 122 in 1998 excluding mergerrelated
items operating income increased to 1766 million in 1999 from 1358 million
in 1998 and increased as a percentage of net sales to 130 from 127 these
increases were attributable to our improved gross profit margin discussed above

     interest income and expense interest income increased 11 million to 17
million in 1999 from 06 million in 1998 the increase resulted from higher
levels of cash and cash equivalents in 1999 compared to 1998 interest expense
increased 22 million to 74 million in 1999 from 52 million in 1998 the
increase resulted from the term loan entered into by dollar express in february
1999 and accretion of the common stock put warrants of dollar express to
redemption value the common stock put warrants were terminated in connection
with the consummation of the merger with dollar express


                                       16
page

     income taxes our effective tax rate increased to 373 for the year ended
december 31 1999 from 354 for the year ended december 31 1998 because dollar
express was not subject to corporatelevel income taxes before its conversion
from an s to c corporation on february 5 1999 this increase was partially
offset by a 22 million deferred tax benefit recorded in connection with its
conversion from an s to c corporation for income tax purposes

liquidity and capital resources

overview

     our business requires capital to open new stores and operate existing
stores our working capital requirements for existing stores are seasonal and
usually reach their peak in the months of september and october historically
we have satisfied our seasonal working capital requirements for existing stores
and funded our store opening and relocation and expansion programs from
internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities

     the following table compares cashrelated information for the years ended
december 31 2000 1999 and 1998

                                                     year ended december 31

     financing activities     129      235          73

     the 209 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2000
was caused primarily by the decrease in fourth quarter operating results as
compared to 1999 this resulted in a carry over of approximately 5 more of our
fourth quarter seasonal merchandise as compared to 1999

     cash used in investing activities is generally expended to open new stores
the 396 million increase in investing activities was primarily due to an
increase in capital expenditures for the year 2000 compared to the same period
in 1999 as a result of the following

     o    an increase in the number of new stores opened and the average size of
          those stores in 2000

     o    an increase in the number of relocations and expansions

     o    the expansion of the store support center

     o    improvement in our supply chain processes and

     o    installation of new registers and backoffice equipment in the dollar
          express stores

     the 364 million decrease in cash provided by used in financing
activities was primarily the result of the following

     o    we did not receive any proceeds from the issuance of equity excluding
          stockbased compensation plans in 2000 compared to the 322 million
          received in 1999 related to the issuance of dollar expresss preferred
          stock and common stock put warrants

     o    we made net repayments of approximately 342 million in 2000 due to
          repayment of dollar expresss term loan and revolving credit facility
          and the first principal payment on the senior notes in 1999 we had
          net borrowings of approximately 230 million related primarily to
          draw downs on dollar expresss term loan and revolving credit
          facility

     o    we received 158 million more cash pursuant to stockbased
          compensation plans in 2000 compared to 1999 because of increased stock
          option exercises

     o    we did not pay any distributions in 2000 compared to the 610 million
          of distributions paid in the first nine months of 1999 to the former
          shareholders of dollar express and only one

     o    we received 216 million related to the saleleaseback transaction in

     at december 31 2000 our borrowings under our bank facilities senior
notes and bonds were 430 million and we had an additional 1350 million
available under our bank facility of the amount available approximately 710
million was committed to letters of credit issued for the routine purchase of
imported merchandise

funding requirements

     we expect to add approximately 250 to 260 stores in 2001 in 2000 the
average investment per new store including capital expenditures initial
inventory and preopening costs was as follows

                                 number of              average investment
        store type             stores opened                per store
                                     
     traditional stores            117                       211000

     all stores                    233                        272000

we expect our cash needs for opening new stores in 2001 including approximately
165 to 175 of the larger format stores to total approximately 897 million we
have budgeted approximately 535 million for capital expenditures and 362
million for initial inventory and preopening costs our total planned capital
expenditures for 2001 are approximately 1147 million including planned
expenditures for new expanded and relocated stores investments in our supply
chain processes additional equipment for the distribution centers and
remodeling and upgrading many of the dollar express stores we believe that we
can adequately fund our planned capital expenditures and working capital
requirements for the next few years from net cash provided by operations and
borrowings under our credit facility

     bank credit facilities during september 1996 we entered into an amended
and restated credit agreement with our banks which currently provides for a
1350 million unsecured revolving credit facility to be used for working
capital letters of credit and development needs bearing interest at the agent
banks prime rate or libor plus a spread at our option as of december 31
2000 the interest rate was approximately 71 the credit agreement among
other things requires the maintenance of specified ratios restricts the
payments of cash dividends and other distributions and limits the amount of debt
we can incur the facility terminates on may 31 2002 dollar expresss former
credit facility was paid in full after the consummation of the merger on may 5
2000

     effective march 12 2001 we entered into a new revolving credit facility
with our banks which provides for a 500 million unsecured revolving credit
facility to be used for working capital bearing interest at the agent banks
prime rate or libor plus a spread at our option the credit agreement among
other things requires the maintenance of specified ratios restricts the
payments of certain distributions and limits certain types of debt we can incur
the facility terminates on march 11 2002

     also effective march 12 2001 we entered into a letter of credit
reimbursement and security agreement which provides 1250 million for letters
of credit which are generally issued in relation to the routine purchase of
imported merchandise

     operating lease agreements we have entered into operating leases for three
of our distribution centers under these agreements the lessor is required to
purchase the property pay for the construction costs and lease the facility to
us the following table includes information related to these operating leases

facilitate the construction of a new 400 million distribution center in briar
creek pennsylvania

     on september 8 2000 we entered into a 100 million interest rate swap
agreement to manage the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations on a
portion of our stockton distribution center lease the swap creates the economic
equivalent of a fixed rate lease by converting the variable interest rate to a
fixed rate under this agreement we pay interest to a financial institution at
a fixed rate of 645 in exchange the financial institution pays us at a
variable interest rate which approximates the floating rate on the lease
agreement excluding the credit spread the interest rate on the swap is subject
to adjustment monthly no payments are made by either party under the swap for
monthly periods with an established interest rate greater than 741 the swap
is effective through june 2004 but it may be canceled by the bank or us and
settled for the fair value of the swap as determined by market rates the fair
value of this swap at december 31 2000 was approximately 02 million

     on december 20 2000 we entered into a 50 million interest rate swap
agreement to manage the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations on a
portion of our stockton distribution center lease under this agreement we pay
interest to a financial institution at a fixed rate of 583 in exchange the
financial institution pays us at a variable interest rate which approximates
the floating rate on the lease agreement excluding the credit spread the
interest rate on the swap is subject to adjustment monthly no payments are made
by either party under the swap for monthly periods with an established interest
rate greater than 741 the swap is effective through june 2004 but it may be
canceled by the bank or us and settled for the fair value of the swap as
determined by market rates the fair value of this swap at december 31 2000 was
approximately 15000

     effective march 12 2001 we entered into an operating lease facility for
1650 million of which approximately 93 million was committed to our existing
stockton briar creek and savannah distribution centers our existing
distribution center operating lease agreements for stockton briar creek and
savannah were replaced with this facility the termination date of this
operating lease facility is march 2006 as a result the lease expiration date
for the stockton briar creek and savannah distribution centers is now march
2006 the lease facility among other things requires the maintenance of
certain specified financial ratios restricts the payment of certain
distributions and limits certain types of debt we can incur

     saleleaseback transaction in september 1999 we sold some retail store
leasehold improvements to an unrelated third party and leased them back for
seven years we have an option to repurchase the leasehold improvements at the
end of the fifth and seventh years at amounts approximating their fair market
values at the time the option is exercised the transaction is treated as a
financing arrangement for financial accounting purposes the total amount of the
lease obligation is 290 million we are required to make monthly lease
payments of 438000 in the first five years and 638000 in the sixth and
seventh years as a result of the transaction we received net cash of 209
million and an 81 million 110 note receivable which matures in september
2006

     revenue and bond financing in may 1998 we entered into an agreement with
the mississippi business finance corporation under which it issued 190 million
of variable rate demand revenue bonds we borrowed the proceeds from the bonds
to finance the acquisition construction and installation of land buildings
machinery and equipment for our new distribution facility in olive branch
mississippi at december 31 2000 the balance outstanding on the bonds was
190 million we begin repayment of the principal amount of the bonds in june
2006 with a portion maturing each june 1 until the final portion matures in
june 2018 the bonds do not have a prepayment penalty as long as the interest
rate remains variable the bonds contain a demand provision and therefore
outstanding amounts are classified as current liabilities we pay interest
monthly based on a variable interest rate which was 73 at december 31 2000
the bonds are secured by a 193 million letter of credit issued by one of our
existing lending banks the letter of credit is renewable annually the letter
of credit and reimbursement agreement require that we maintain specified
financial ratios and restrict our ability to pay cash dividends

     in april 1999 we entered into a 190 million interest rate swap agreement
to manage the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations on the demand
revenue bonds under this agreement as amended we pay interest to the bank
that provided the swap at a fixed rate of 488 in exchange the financial
institution pays us at a variable interest rate which is similar to the rate on
the demand revenue bonds the variable interest rate on the interest rate swap
is set monthly no payments are made by either party under the swap for monthly
periods with an established interest rate greater than 775 the swap is
effective through april 1 2009 but it may be canceled by the bank or us and
settled for the fair value of the swap as determined by market rates the fair
value of this swap at december 31 2000 was approximately 03 million

     debt securities in april 1997 we issued 300 million of 729 unsecured
senior notes we used the proceeds to pay down a portion of the revolving credit
facility which enabled us to use that credit facility to fund capital
expenditures for the chesapeake corporate headquarters and distribution center
we pay interest on the notes semiannually on april 30 and october 30 each year
and we pay principal in five equal annual installments of 60 million which
began april 30 2000 the note holders have the right to require us to prepay
the notes in full without premium upon a change of control or upon specified
asset dispositions or other transactions we may make the note agreements
prohibit specified mergers and consolidations in which our company is not the
surviving company require that we maintain specified financial ratios require
that the notes rank on par with other debt and limit the amount of debt we can
incur in the event of default or a prepayment at our option we must pay a
penalty to the note holder

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations

     we experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales comparable store net
sales operating income and net income and expect this trend to continue our
results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety
of factors including

     o    shifts in the timing of certain holidays especially easter which may
          fall in different quarters from year to year

     o    the timing of new store openings

     o    the net sales contributed by new stores

     o    changes in our merchandise mix and

     o    competition

     our highest sales periods are the christmas and easter seasons we
generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and a substantial
majority of our operating and net income during the fourth quarter in
anticipation of increased sales activity during these months we purchase
substantial amounts of inventory and hire a significant number of temporary
employees to supplement our permanent store staff our operating results
particularly operating and net income could suffer if our net sales were below
seasonal norms during the fourth quarter or easter season for any reason
including merchandise delivery delays due to receiving or distribution problems
historically net sales operating income and net income have been weakest
during the first quarter we expect this trend to continue

     our larger store format has a slightly different seasonal sales pattern
than our traditional stores these larger stores realize a lower percentage of
their annual sales in the fourth quarter as compared to our traditional stores
we believe this is a result of the larger format stores containing a higher
proportion of basic consumer products than our traditional stores

     our unaudited results of operations for the eight most recent quarters are
shown in a table in footnote 12 of the consolidated financial statements in item
8 of this form 10k to reconcile the combined companys quarterly information
with that previously reported by dollar tree refer to our form 8k filed on
may 24 2000 which includes quarterly information for the combined companies

inflation and other economic factors

     our ability to provide quality merchandise at a fixed price and on a
profitable basis is subject to economic factors that we cannot control
including inflation in shipping rates wage rates and other operating costs

     shipping costs in may 1998 the transpacific shipping cartel imposed a
freight increase of 300 per container on us imports from asia in may 1999
the cartel imposed a further increase of 900 per container for shipments from
asia to the west coast of the united states and 1000 for shipments to the east
coast with a 300 per container surcharge during the peak shipping season from
june 1 through november 30 the transpacific stabilization agreement tsa
which has essentially replaced the transpacific shipping cartel may call for
increased shipping rates and a peak season surcharge in 2001 as a result our
transpacific shipping rates may increase when we renegotiate our import
shipping rates effective may 2001

     during 2000 we experienced a 12 million increase in our domestic freight
costs because of increased domestic fuel costs if fuel costs remain at current
levels we believe our domestic freight expense in 2001 will increase by an
additional 05 to 07 million compared with 2000 in addition higher fuel
costs are expected to increase our import freight costs in the form of a fuel
surcharge we expect these costs will increase approximately 05 million in
2001

                                       20

     minimum wage although our average hourly wage rate is significantly higher
than the federal minimum wage an increase in the mandated minimum wage could
significantly increase our payroll costs for example the federal minimum wage
increased by 050 per hour on october 1 1996 and by an additional 040 per
hour on september 1 1997 these changes increased payroll costs by
approximately 50 million in 1998 excluding the impact this increase had on
the 98 cent clearance center only one and dollar express stores in february
2000 the us senate approved a proposal increasing the federal minimum wage by
100 per hour over three years in march 2000 the us house of
representatives approved a proposal increasing the federal minimum wage by 100
per hour over two years no bill was passed into law and the status of this
issue in the 2001 congress is uncertain given the new administration if the
minimum wage were to increase by 100 per hour we believe that our annual
payroll expenses would increase by approximately 20 to 25 of operating
expenses unless we realize offsetting cost reductions

     leases for replaced distribution centers we are liable for rent and
passthrough costs under leases for our former distribution center in memphis
through september 2005 our former distribution center in sacramento through
june 2008 and our current distribution center in philadelphia through december
2002 annual rent and passthrough costs are approximately 07 million for the
memphis facility 06 million for the sacramento facility and 05 million for
the philadelphia facility we subleased the memphis facility through march 2002
and the sacramento facility through june 2008 we have recorded charges for the
memphis and sacramento leases considering current market conditions and probable
sublease income at each location

     unless offsetting cost savings are realized adverse economic factors
including inflation in operating costs could harm our financial condition and
results of operations

new accounting pronouncements

     statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 133 accounting for
derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended by sfas no 138
establishes accounting standards for derivative instruments and hedging
activities and requires the recognition of all derivatives as either assets or
liabilities in the statement of financial position at their fair value we
adopted this statement effective january 1 2001 we do not expect the
implementation of this pronouncement to materially affect our financial
condition or results of operations

     pursuant to sfas no 133 our current interest rate swaps do not qualify
for cash flow hedge accounting as a result changes in the fair value of our
existing derivative instruments will be recorded currently in earnings these
changes in fair value are not predictable



item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

     we are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of our
business including the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency
rate fluctuations we may enter into interest rate swaps to manage exposure to
interest rate changes and we may employ other risk management strategies
including the use of foreign currency forward contracts we do not enter into
derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging purposes we
do not hold derivatives for trading purposes

interest rate risk

     we have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk
consisting of debt obligations issued at variable and fixed rates based on
amounts outstanding on our fixed rate debt obligations at december 31 2000 we
do not consider our exposure to interest rate risk to be material

     we use variablerate debt and operating leases to finance our operations
and capital improvements these obligations expose us to variability in interest
payments due to changes in interest rates if interest rates increase interest
expense increases conversely if interest rates decrease interest expense also
decreases we believe it is beneficial to limit the variability of our interest
payments

     to meet this objective we entered into derivative instruments in the form
of interest rate swaps to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from
changes in the variable interest rates on the obligations the interest rate
swaps reduce the interest rate exposure on these variablerate obligations
under the interest rate swap we pay the bank at a fixed rate and receive
variable interest at a rate approximating the variable rate on the obligation
thereby creating the economic equivalent of a fixed rate obligation no payments
are made by either party under the swap for monthly periods in which the
variable interest rate is greater than the predetermined knockout rate

  interest rate swap

we do not believe our exposure to changes in the fair value of the interest rate
swaps is material

foreign currency risk

     although we purchase most of our imported goods with us dollars we are
subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to payments to suppliers
in italian lire when favorable exchange rates exist we may hedge foreign
currency commitments of future payments by purchasing foreign currency forward
contracts on december 31 2000 we had no contracts outstanding less than 1
of our purchases are contracted in italian lire and the market risk exposure
relating to currency exchange rate fluctuations is not material
