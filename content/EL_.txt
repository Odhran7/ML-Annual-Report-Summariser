marketing 

our strategy to market and promote our products begins with our welldiversified portfolio of distinctive brands across four product categories our portfolio can be deployed in multiple distribution channels key travel corridors and geographies where our global reputation and awareness of our brands benefit us our geographic and distribution channel diversity allows us to engage local consumers across an array of developed and emerging markets by emphasizing products and services with the greatest local relevance inclusiveness and appeal this strategy is built around “bringing the best to everyone we touch” our founder mrs estée lauder formulated this unique marketing philosophy to provide “hightouch” service and highquality products as the foundation for a solid and loyal consumer base our “hightouch” approach is demonstrated through our integrated consumer engagement models that leverage our product specialists and technology to provide the consumer with a distinct and truly personalized experience that can include personal consultations with beauty advisors in person or online who demonstrate and educate the consumer on product usage and application as our business has grown and channel mix has evolved we have further expanded our marketing philosophy and “hightouch” execution to build both online and offline personalized consumer experiences through digital and physical demonstration targeted digital media and tailored trialtoloyalty pathways we plan to continue to leverage our core strengths including the quality of our products our “hightouch” consumer engagement and a diversified portfolio of brands channels and geographies

the onset of the covid19 pandemic had a significant impact on consumer behaviors and accelerated the trend for a digitalfirst consumer journey and ecommerce this provided a catalyst for redesigning each brands “hightouch” experience and accelerated changes to our directtoconsumer business models and consumer engagement programs such as selling through social media and web conferencing platforms “virtual selling” these models and programs continue to provide distinct onetoone and onetomany “hightouch” omnichannel services and personalized experiences by leveraging technology and our talented beauty advisors consultants and makeup artists

manufacturing warehousing and raw materials 

we manufacture our products primarily in our own facilities in the united states belgium switzerland the united kingdom and canada and also leverage global thirdparty manufacturing networks we continue to streamline our manufacturing processes and identify sourcing opportunities to improve innovation increase efficiencies minimize our impact on the environment ensure supply sufficiency and reduce costs our plants are modern and our manufacturing processes are substantially automated in fiscal 2021 we began construction of a new manufacturing facility near tokyo which is expected to enable us to better meet demand and increase speed to market in the asiapacific region construction of the first phase was completed in fiscal 2022 and we expect the remainder of the site to be completed and operational in early fiscal 2024 while we believe that our manufacturing network of internal and external sites is sufficient to meet current and reasonably anticipated increased requirements we continue to implement improvements in capacity technology and productivity and align our manufacturing with regional sales demand to be more agile from timetotime demand changes may challenge our capacity for certain subcategories on a shortterm basis but we believe that these changes will not impact our ability to meet our annual or longterm strategic objectives 

we have established a flexible global distribution network of logistic providers that is managed by us or third parties the network is designed to meet the changing demands of our customers while maintaining service levels we are continuously evaluating and adjusting this physical distribution network particularly as we work to anticipate and respond to channel shifts we have established regional and local distribution centers including those maintained by third parties strategically positioned throughout the world in order to facilitate efficient delivery of our products to our customers and consumers in fiscal 2022 we opened a new stateoftheart distribution center in switzerland to support the growth of our travel retail business and further drive our sustainability efforts

risks related to our business and our industry 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic could materially adversely affect our financial results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and difficult to predict 

the outbreak and global spread of the covid19 pandemic has continued to significantly disrupt our operating environment including retail stores travel retail and the ability of some of our customers to operate we have also seen shifts in consumer preferences and practices 

considerable uncertainty remains regarding this pandemic including responsive measures being taken by various authorities and others as we continue to monitor covid19 developments including the impacts on our consumers customers and suppliers we have taken and will continue to take further measures some of the actions we take could adversely impact our business and there is no certainty that our actions will be sufficient to mitigate the risks and the impacts of covid19 

the degree to which covid19 continues to impact our business will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted many of which are outside our control including the extent to which there are sustainable improvements in the retail environment and general economic conditions 

the beauty business is highly competitive and if we are unable to compete effectively our results will suffer 

we face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world including multinational consumer product companies some competitors have greater resources than we do others are newer companies some backed by privateequity investors and some are competing in distribution channels where we are less represented in some cases we may not be able to respond to changing business and economic conditions as quickly as our competitors competition in the beauty business is based on a variety of factors including pricing of products innovation perceived value service to the consumer promotional activities advertising special events new product introductions ecommerce and mcommerce initiatives and other activities it is difficult for us to predict the timing and scale of our competitors’ actions in these areas 

our ability to compete also depends on the continued strength of our brands our ability to attract and retain key talent and other personnel the efficiency of our manufacturing facilities and distribution network and our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property and those other rights used in our business our company has a wellrecognized and strong reputation that could be negatively impacted by social media and many other factors if our reputation is adversely affected our ability to attract and retain customers consumers and employees could be impacted in addition certain of our key retailers around the world market and sell competing brands or are owned or otherwise affiliated with companies that market and sell competing brands our inability to continue to compete effectively in key countries around the world eg china could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our inability to anticipate and respond to market trends and changes in consumer preferences could adversely affect our financial results 

our continued success depends on our ability to anticipate gauge and react in a timely and costeffective manner to changes in consumer preferences for skin care makeup fragrance and hair care products attitudes toward our industry and brands as well as to where and how consumers shop we must continually work to develop manufacture and market new products maintain and adapt our “hightouch” services to existing and emerging distribution channels maintain and enhance the recognition of our brands achieve a favorable mix of products successfully manage our inventories and modernize and refine our approach as to how and where we market and sell our products we recognize that consumer preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and can change rapidly driven by the use of digital and social media by consumers and the speed by which information and opinions are shared if we are unable to anticipate and respond to sudden challenges that we may face in the marketplace trends in the market for our products and changing consumer demands and sentiment our financial results will suffer in addition from time to time sales growth or profitability may be concentrated in a relatively small number of our brands channels or countries eg china if such a situation persists or one or more brands channels or countries fails to perform as expected there could be a material adverse effect on our business 

in certain key markets such as the united states we have seen a longerterm decline in retail traffic in our department store customers and in our freestanding stores we continue to see the shift in consumer preference to the online channel which accelerated in response to the covid19 pandemic consolidation or liquidation in the retail trade from these or other factors may result in us becoming increasingly dependent on key retailers and could result in an increased risk related to the concentration of our customers a severe adverse impact on the business operations of our customers could have a corresponding material adverse effect on us if one or more of our largest customers change their strategies including pricing or promotional activities enter bankruptcy or similar proceedings or if our relationship with any large customer is changed or terminated for any reason there could be a material adverse effect on our business 

our future success depends in part on our ability to achieve our longterm strategy 

achieving our longterm strategy will require investment in new capabilities brands categories distribution channels supply chain facilities technologies and emerging and more mature geographic markets eg china these investments may result in shortterm costs without any current sales and therefore may be dilutive to our earnings in addition we may dispose of or discontinue select brands or streamline operations and incur costs or restructuring and other charges in doing so although we believe that our strategy will lead to longterm growth in sales and profitability we may not realize the anticipated benefits the failure to realize benefits which may be due to our inability to execute plans global or local economic conditions competition changes in the beauty industry and the other risks described herein could have a material adverse effect on our business 

acquisitions and divestitures may expose us to additional risks 

we continuously review acquisition and strategic investment opportunities that would expand our current product offerings our distribution channels increase the size and geographic scope of our operations or otherwise offer growth and operating efficiency opportunities in addition we periodically review our brand portfolio and our strategy includes potential divestitures of certain brands as we rationalize product offerings there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify these strategic actions and consummate such transactions on favorable terms 

acquisitions including strategic investments or alliances entail numerous risks which may include i difficulties in integrating acquired operations or products including the loss of key employees from or customers consumers or suppliers of acquired businesses ii diversion of management’s attention from our existing businesses iii adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers customers and consumers of ours or the companies in which we invest iv adverse impacts of margin and product cost structures different from those of our current mix of business v reputational risks associated with the activities of the businesses that we acquire or in which we invest and vi risks of entering distribution channels categories or markets in which we have limited or no prior experience 

if required the financing for these transactions could result in an increase in our indebtedness dilute the interests of our stockholders or both the purchase price for some acquisitions may include additional amounts to be paid in cash in the future a portion of which may be contingent on the achievement of certain future operating results of the acquired business if the performance of any such acquired business exceeds such operating results then we may incur additional charges and be required to pay additional amounts 

completed acquisitions typically result in additional goodwill andor an increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet we are required at least annually or as facts and circumstances exist to test goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to determine if impairment has occurred we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired there could be a material adverse effect on our business 

our failure to achieve the longterm plan for acquired businesses as well as any other adverse consequences associated with our acquisition divestiture and investment activities could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our business could be negatively impacted by social impact and sustainability matters 

there is an increased focus from certain investors customers consumers regulators employees and other stakeholders concerning social impact and sustainability and other esg matters from time to time we announce certain initiatives including goals and commitments regarding our focus areas which include environmental matters packaging responsible sourcing social investments and inclusion and diversity we could fail or be perceived to fail in our achievement of such initiatives or in accurately reporting our progress on such initiatives such failures could be due to changes in our business eg shifts in business among distribution channels or acquisitions moreover the standards by which esg efforts and related matters are measured are developing and evolving and certain areas are subject to assumptions that could change over time in addition we could be criticized for the scope of our initiatives or goals or perceived as not acting responsibly in connection with these matters any such matters or related esg matters could have a material adverse effect on our business 

a general economic downturn or sudden disruption in business conditions may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items andor the financial strength of our customers that are retailers which could adversely affect our financial results 

the general level of consumer spending is affected by a number of factors including general economic conditions inflation interest rates energy costs and consumer confidence generally all of which are beyond our control consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower and may impact sales of our products a decline in consumer purchases of discretionary items also tends to impact our customers that are retailers we generally extend credit to a retailer based on an evaluation of its financial condition usually without requiring collateral however the financial difficulties of a retailer could cause us to curtail or eliminate business with that customer we may also assume more credit risk relating to the receivables from that retailer in the event of a retailer liquidation we may incur additional costs if we choose to purchase the retailer’s inventory of our products to protect brand equity our inability to collect receivables from our largest customers or from a group of customers could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in addition sudden disruptions in local or global business conditions for example from events such as a pandemic or other health issues geopolitical or local conflicts civil unrest terrorist attacks adverse weather conditions climate changes or seismic events can have a shortterm and sometimes longterm impact on consumer spending 

events that impact consumers’ willingness or ability to travel or purchase our products while traveling may impact our business including travel retail a significant contributor to our overall results and our strategy to market and sell products to international travelers at their destinations 

a downturn in the economies of or continuing recessions in the countries where we sell our products or a sudden disruption of business conditions in those countries could adversely affect consumer confidence the financial strength of our retailers and our sales and profitability we are also cautious of foreign currency movements including their impact on tourism additionally we continue to monitor the effects of the global macroeconomic environment social political and human rights issues regulatory matters including the imposition of tariffs or sanctions geopolitical tensions and global security issues 

volatility in the financial markets and a related economic downturn in key markets or markets generally throughout the world could have a material adverse effect on our business while we typically generate significant cash flows from our ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities credit markets may experience significant disruptions deterioration in global financial markets or an adverse change in our credit ratings could make future financing difficult or more expensive if any financial institutions that are parties to our revolving credit facility or other financing arrangements such as foreign exchange or interest rate hedging instruments were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us this could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain foreign currency or interest rate exposures which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our success depends in part on the quality efficacy and safety of our products 

our success depends in part on the quality efficacy and safety of our products if our products are found to be defective or unsafe our product claims are found to be deceptive or our products otherwise fail to meet our consumers’ expectations our relationships with customers or consumers could suffer the appeal of our brands could be diminished and we could lose sales and become subject to liability or claims any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business in addition counterfeit versions of some of our products may be sold by third parties which may pose safety risks may fail to meet consumers’ expectations and may have a negative impact on our business 

our success depends in part on our key personnel 

our success depends in part on our ability to retain our key personnel including our executive officers and senior management team the unexpected loss of or misconduct by one or more of our key employees could adversely affect our business our success also depends in part on our continuing ability to identify hire train and retain personnel across all levels of our business competition for employees can be intense we may not be able to attract assimilate or retain necessary personnel in the future and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business this risk may be exacerbated by the stresses associated with the implementation of our strategic plan and other initiatives as well as by market conditions 

we are subject to risks related to the global scope of our operations 

we operate on a global basis with a substantial majority of our fiscal 2022 net sales and operating income generated outside the united states we maintain offices in over 50 countries and have key operational facilities located inside and outside the united states that manufacture warehouse or distribute goods for sale throughout the world our global operations are subject to many risks and uncertainties including i fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and the relative costs of operating in different places which can affect our results of operations the value of our foreign assets the relative prices at which we and competitors sell products in the same markets the cost of certain inventory and noninventory items required in our operations and the relative prices at which we sell our products in different markets ii foreign or us laws regulations and policies including restrictions on trade immigration and travel operations and investments currency exchange controls restrictions on imports and exports including license requirements tariffs sanctions and taxes iii lack of wellestablished or reliable legal and administrative systems in certain countries in which we operate iv adverse weather conditions and natural disasters v concentration of sales growth or profitability in one or more countries eg china and vi social economic and geopolitical conditions such as a pandemic terrorist attack war or other military action these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business 

a disruption in our operations or supply chain could adversely affect our business 

as a company engaged in manufacturing and distribution on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including industrial accidents environmental events strikes and other labor disputes capacity constraints disruptions in ingredient material or packaging supply as well as global shortages disruptions in supply chain or information technology loss or impairment of key manufacturing or distribution sites or suppliers product quality control safety increase in commodity prices and energy costs licensing requirements and other regulatory issues as well as natural disasters and other external factors over which we have no control if such an event were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we use a wide variety of direct and indirect suppliers of goods and services from around the world some of our products rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers could subject us to losses or adversely affect our ability to bring products to market further the failure of our suppliers to deliver goods and services in sufficient quantities in compliance with applicable standards and in a timely manner could adversely affect our customer service levels and overall business in addition any increases in the costs of goods and services for our business may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies in our operations 

as we outsource functions we become more dependent on the entities performing those functions 

as part of our longterm strategy we are continually looking for opportunities to provide essential business services in a more costeffective manner in some cases this requires the outsourcing of functions or parts of functions that can be performed more effectively by external service providers these include certain information technology supply chain finance and human resource functions the failure of one or more such providers to deliver the expected services provide them on a timely basis or to provide them at the prices we expect may have a material adverse effect on our business in addition when we transition external service providers we may experience challenges that could have a material adverse effect on our business 

risks related to legal and regulatory matters 

changes in laws regulations and policies that affect our business could adversely affect our financial results 

our business is subject to numerous laws regulations and policies around the world changes in these laws regulations and policies including the interpretation or enforcement thereof that affect our business could adversely affect our financial results these changes include accounting standards as well as laws and regulations relating to tax matters trade including sanctions data privacy eg general data protection regulation gdpr cybersecurity anticorruption advertising marketing manufacturing distribution customs matters product registration ingredients chemicals packaging selective distribution and environmental or climate change matters 

disputes and other legal or regulatory proceedings could adversely affect our financial results 

we are and may in the future become party to litigation other disputes or regulatory proceedings across a wide range of matters including ones relating to product liability matters including asbestosrelated claims advertising regulatory employment intellectual property real estate environmental trade relations tax and privacy in general claims made by us or against us in litigation disputes or other proceedings can be expensive and time consuming and could result in settlements injunctions or damages that could significantly affect our business it is not possible to predict the final resolution of the litigation disputes or proceedings to which we currently are or may in the future become party to and the impact of certain of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business  

government reviews inquiries investigations and actions could harm our business 

as we operate in various locations around the world our operations are subject to governmental scrutiny and may be adversely impacted by the results of such scrutiny the regulatory environment with regard to our business is evolving and officials often exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply applicable regulations from time to time we may receive formal and informal inquiries from various government regulatory authorities as well as selfregulatory organizations about our business and compliance with local laws regulations or standards any determination that our operations or activities or the activities of our employees are not in compliance with existing laws regulations or standards could negatively impact us in a number of ways including the imposition of substantial fines interruptions of business loss of supplier vendor or other thirdparty relationships termination of necessary licenses and permits or similar results all of which could potentially harm our business regardless of the outcomes these reviews inquiries investigations and actions could create negative publicity which could harm our business 

risks related to technology and cybersecurity matters 

our information technology and websites may be susceptible to cybersecurity breaches outages and other risks 

we rely on information technology that supports our business processes including product development marketing sales order processing production distribution finance and intracompany communications throughout the world we have ecommerce mcommerce and other internet websites in the united states and many other countries these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire floods power loss telecommunications failures breakins and other events our systems and data may be vulnerable to constantly evolving cybersecurity threats such as malware breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering the occurrence of these or other events could disrupt or damage our information technology including operational technology and adversely affect our business insurance policies that may provide coverage with regard to such events may not cover any or all of the resulting financial losses 

failure to adequately maintain the security of our electronic and other confidential information could materially adversely affect our business 

we are dependent upon automated information technology processes as part of our normal business activities we collect and store certain information that is confidential proprietary or otherwise sensitive including personal information with respect to customers consumers and employees we share some of this information with certain vendors who assist us with business matters moreover the success of our ecommerce and mcommerce operations depends upon the secure transmission of confidential and personal data over public networks including the use of cashless payments any failure on the part of us or our vendors to maintain the security of our confidential data and personal information including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information could result in business disruption damage to our reputation financial obligations to third parties fines penalties regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs and also result in deterioration in our employees’ consumers’ and customers’ confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition a security or data privacy breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to enhance our information security systems and could result in a disruption to our operations furthermore third parties including our suppliers and customers also rely on information technology and may be subject to cybersecurity breaches that could impact their businesses and could in turn disrupt our supply chain andor our business 

we are subject to risks associated with our global information technology 

our implementation maintenance and utilization of global information technology including operational technology supply chain and finance systems human resource management systems creative asset management and retail operating systems as well as associated hardware and use of cloudbased models involve risks and uncertainties failure to implement maintain or utilize these and other systems as planned in terms of timing specifications security policies costs or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business 

risks related to our securities and our ownership structure 

the trading prices of our securities periodically may rise or fall based on the accuracy of predictions of our financial performance 

our business planning process is designed to maximize our longterm strength growth and profitability not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter we believe that this longerterm focus is in the best interests of the company and our stockholders at the same time however we recognize that it may be helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our expectations regarding certain aspects of our business this could include forecasts of net sales earnings per share and other financial metrics or projections we assume no responsibility to provide or update guidance and any longerterm guidance we may provide is based on goals that we believe at the time guidance is given are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years we historically have paid dividends on our common stock and repurchased shares of our class a common stock however at times we have suspended the declaration of dividends andor the repurchase of our class a common stock going forward at any time we could stop or suspend payment of dividends or stop or suspend our stock repurchase program and any such action could cause the market price of our stock to decline 

in all of our public statements when we make or update a forwardlooking statement about our business whether it be about net sales or earnings expectations or expectations regarding restructuring or other initiatives or otherwise we accompany such statements directly or by reference to a public document with a list of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we expect such a list is included among other places in our earnings press release and in our periodic filings with the sec eg in our reports on form 10k and form 10q these and other factors may make it difficult for us and for outside observers such as research analysts to predict what our earnings or other financial metrics or business outcomes will be in any given fiscal quarter or year 

outside analysts and investors have the right to make their own predictions of our business for any future period outside analysts however have access to no more material information about our results or plans than any other public investor and we do not endorse their predictions as to our future performance nor do we assume any responsibility to correct the predictions of outside analysts or others when they differ from our own internal expectations if our actual results differ from those that outside analysts or others have been predicting the market price of our securities could be affected investors who rely on the predictions of outside analysts or others when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk we take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in the prices of our securities

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

results of operations 

we manufacture market and sell beauty products including those in the skin care makeup fragrance and hair care categories which are distributed in approximately 150 countries and territories the following table is a comparative summary of operating results for fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 and reflects the basis of presentation described in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 2 – summary of significant accounting policies and note 22 – segment data and related information for all periods presented products and services that do not meet our definition of skin care makeup fragrance and hair care have been included in the “other” category 



1 the net sales from the company’s travel retail business are included in the europe the middle east  africa region with the exception of net sales of drjart in the travel retail channel that are reflected in korea in the asiapacific region operating income attributable to the travel retail sales included in europe the middle east  africa is included in that region and in the americas 

the following table presents certain consolidated earnings data as a percentage of net sales 



periodoverperiod changes in our net sales are generally attributable to the impacts from i pricing on our base portfolio including changes in strategic pricing actions and mix ii volume including changes driven by the impact of new product innovation iii acquisitions andor divestitures andor iv foreign currency translation 

the net sales impact from pricing consists of changes in list prices due to strategic pricing initiatives and mix shifts within and among product categories geographic regions and distribution channels the prices at which we sell our products vary by brand distribution channel eg wholesale or directtoconsumer and may also vary by country our brands and products cover a broad array of pricing tiers prices of skin care and fragrance products are typically higher than makeup and hair care products 

new product innovation includes the introduction of new products as well as the innovation of existing products including reformulations regional expansion repackaging and sets a product is considered new innovation for the twelvemonth period following the initial shipment date our innovation is launched at different price points than existing products and value derived from innovation may vary from year to year we continually introduce new products support new and established products through advertising merchandising and sampling and phase out existing products that no longer meet the needs of our consumers or our objectives the economics of developing producing launching supporting and discontinuing products impact our sales and operating performance each period the introduction of new products often has some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products which we take into account in our business planning the impact of new product introductions including timing compared to introductions in prior periods also affects our results 

nongaap financial measures 

we use certain nongaap financial measures among other financial measures to evaluate our operating performance which represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business management believes that excluding certain items that are not comparable from period to period helps investors and others compare operating performance between periods while we consider the nongaap measures useful in analyzing our results they are not intended to replace or act as a substitute for any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with us gaap see reconciliations of nongaap financial measures beginning on page 49 for reconciliations between nongaap financial measures and the most directly comparable us gaap measures

overview 

covid19 business update 

the covid19 pandemic continued to disrupt our operating environment globally primarily impacting supply chain inventory levels and other logistics during the year ended june 30 2022 the resurgence of covid19 cases in many chinese provinces led to restrictions late in the fiscal 2022 third quarter that remained in place through the end of fiscal 2022 to prevent further spread of the virus consequently retail traffic travel and distribution capabilities were temporarily curtailed our distribution facilities in shanghai operated with limited capacity to fulfill brickandmortar and online orders beginning in midmarch 2022 and returned to normal capacity by early june 2022 

government assistance 

beginning in the second half of fiscal 2020 many governments in locations where we operate announced programs to assist employers whose businesses were impacted by the covid19 pandemic including programs that provide rebates to incentivize employers to maintain employees on payroll who were unable to work for their usual number of hours during fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 we qualified for and recorded 12 million 84 million and 99 million respectively in government assistance which reduced selling general and administrative expenses by 9 million 78 million and 87 million respectively and cost of sales by 3 million 6 million and 10 million respectively the remaining 2 million recorded in fiscal 2020 was deferred and recognized in fiscal 2021 as a reduction to cost of sales 

we will continue to monitor the impacts of covid19 and adjust our action plans accordingly as the situation progresses

• our skin care net sales growth reflected incremental net sales attributable to the increase in our ownership of deciem in the fiscal 2021 fourth quarter as well as continued strength in la mer hero products and the launches of the hydrating infused emulsion and the upgrade to the treatment lotion the category has been pressured by covid restrictions primarily in asian markets at various points throughout fiscal 2022 

• our hair care net sales also grew double digits reflecting brickandmortar channel recovery and new product launches from both aveda and bumble and bumble 

our global distribution capability and operations allow us to focus on targeted expanded consumer reach wherever consumer demographics and trends are the most attractive our regional organizations and the expertise of our people there enable our brands to be more locally and culturally relevant in both product assortment and communications we are evolving the way we connect with our consumers in stores online and where they travel including by expanding our digital and social media presence and the engagement of global and local influencers to amplify brand or product stories we tailor implementation of our strategy by market to drive consumer engagement and embrace cultural diversity we continuously strengthen our presence in large imagebuilding core markets while broadening our presence in emerging markets

• net sales decreased slightly in asiapacific reflecting the resurgence of covid19 cases in many chinese provinces which led to restrictions to further prevent the spread of the virus during the second half of fiscal 2022 online continued to thrive primarily due to the currentyear launch on a new thirdparty online platform while brickandmortar retail remains challenged 

as a result of the invasion of ukraine we suspended our business investments and initiatives and commercial activity in russia and ukraine in early march 2022 this included the temporary closure of our owned and authorized freestanding stores and our own brand sites 

as the safety of our employees remains a top priority we continue to take significant steps to support our employees in ukraine including the continuance of compensation maintenance of regular communication and offering relocation assistance and continue to provide compensation and support to our employees in russia we are monitoring the effects of this conflict including risks that may affect our business and expect that we will adjust our plans accordingly as the situation progresses 

for the year ended june 30 2022 the results of operations related to russia and ukraine were not material to our consolidated financial statements 

we approach distribution strategically by product category and location and seek to optimize distribution by matching our brands with appropriate opportunities while seeking to maintain high productivity per door we are expanding our brands in online and travel retail which we believe will be higher growth channels in the long term we also focus on brandbuilding retail activities technologydriven activations and omnichannel capabilities that enhance the shopping experience for consumers 

• as part of this strategy we have built a leadership position in the global travel retail channel that historically allowed us to leverage the robust and growing international passenger traffic while covid19 has significantly curtailed international travel in the nearterm we are seeing some recovery in the americas and europe the middle east  africa and we continue to believe that global travel retail is a longterm growth opportunity travel retail continues to be an important channel for brand building due to the increase in traveling consumers particularly those from emerging markets who often experience our brands for the first time while traveling we continue to expand our strategic presence in travel retail across dutyfree locations primarily in airports and downtown stores and increasingly through online retail we engage consumers at the airport through compelling popup activations in nontraditional commercial areas and we ensure we have appropriate communication and curated assortments for targeted consumer groups at the same time travel retail is susceptible to a number of external factors including fluctuations in currency exchange rates and consumers’ willingness and ability to travel and spend 

• online net sales have continued to grow on a global basis rising double digits for fiscal 2022 we continue to enhance and launch e and mcommerce sites of our own in new and existing markets collaborate with our retail customers on their ecommerce sites and sell through select thirdparty online malls we believe our success in delivering strong online growth is a result of adapting our strategy to meet local market and cultural needs we also continue to develop and implement omnichannel concepts virtual tryon tools and compelling content to deliver an integrated consumer experience and better serve consumers as they shop across channels 

our multiple engines of growth which have historically enabled us to produce excellent net sales growth are also helping to mitigate the impact of the covid19 pandemic we also benefited from the transformation of certain operations that freed up resources to invest behind further growth opportunities our postcovid business acceleration program described below enabled us to reduce costs and invest in new capabilities such as digital marketing and data analytics as well as increased advertising 

in fiscal 2022 we continued to further integrate social impact and sustainability into our strategy and business operations areas of differentiation include climate  energy green chemistry social investments employee engagement and safety and inclusion diversity  equity other areas of focus include responsible sourcing plastics  packaging ingredient transparency and animal welfare 

outlook 

the covid19 pandemic continues to disrupt business for us retailers and other companies with which we do business there have been and are likely to continue to be intermittent store closures and supply chain disruptions we are mindful that these trends may continue to impact the pace of recovery the continued curtailment in international travel is also affecting our travel retail business particularly in asia which had been historically one of our fastest growth areas in addition to impacting net sales and profitability these and other challenges may adversely impact the goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our brands as well as longlived assets ie potentially resulting in impairments 

we believe that the best way to increase longterm stockholder value is to continue providing superior products and services in the most efficient and effective manner while recognizing shifts in consumers’ behaviors and shopping practices accordingly our longterm strategy has numerous initiatives across geographic regions product categories brands channels of distribution and functions designed to grow our sales provide cost efficiencies leverage our strengths and make us more productive and profitable we plan to build upon and leverage our history of outstanding creativity and innovation high quality products and services and engaging communications while investing for longterm sustainable growth 

we continue to monitor the effects of the global macro environment including the risk of recession currency volatility increasing inflationary pressures supply chain disruptions social and political issues regulatory matters including the imposition of tariffs and sanctions geopolitical tensions and global security issues for example we continue to monitor the geopolitical tensions between the united states and china which could have a material adverse effect on our business we are also mindful of inflationary pressures on our cost base and are monitoring the impact on consumer preferences 

in fiscal 2022 net sales from donna karan new york dkny michael kors tommy hilfiger and ermenegildo zegna accounted for approximately 1 of consolidated net sales and 10 of fragrance net sales as noted above we previously announced that we would not be renewing our license agreements for these product lines when their respective terms expire in june 2023 we have since negotiated early termination agreements with each of the licensors effective june 30 2022 and continued to sell products under these licenses until such time we are working with the licensors and their respective new licensee where applicable to transition the business to the new licensees 

the invasion of ukraine has negatively impacted our operations in both russia and ukraine in fiscal 2022 our operations in ukraine and russia accounted for approximately 1 of consolidated net sales in march 2022 we announced a suspension of our business investments and initiatives and commercial activity in russia in july 2022 we liquidated the majority of our remaining inmarket inventory future impacts on our business including sanctions and countersanctions are difficult to predict due to the high level of uncertainty as to how these developments will evolve on a broader perspective there could be additional negative impacts to our net sales earnings assets and cash flows should these matters continue or escalate such impacts could include economic challenges in other countries because of inflationary pressures or other consequences please refer to risk factors in part i item 1a of the companys annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended june 30 2022 for a more complete discussion of the risks we encounter in our business and industry 

the uncertainty around the timing speed and duration of the recovery from the adverse impacts of the covid19 pandemic including the impacts on our business of the ongoing restrictions in china will continue to affect our ability to grow sales profitably we believe we can to some extent offset the impact of more ordinary challenges by continually developing and pursuing a diversified strategy with multiple engines of growth and by accelerating initiatives focused on areas of strength discipline and agility and by executing upon our postcovid business acceleration program as the current situation continues to progress if economic and social conditions or the degree of uncertainty or volatility worsen or the adverse conditions previously described are further prolonged there could be a further negative effect on consumer confidence demand spending and willingness or ability to travel and as a result on our business we are continuing to monitor these and other risks that may affect our business 

postcovid business acceleration program 

on august 20 2020 we announced a twoyear restructuring program postcovid business acceleration program the “pcba program” designed to realign our business to address the dramatic shifts to our distribution landscape and consumer behaviors in the wake of the covid19 pandemic the pcba program is designed to help improve efficiency and effectiveness by rebalancing resources to growth areas of prestige beauty it is expected to further strengthen us by building upon the foundational capabilities in which we have invested 

the pcba program’s main areas of focus include accelerating the shift to online with the realignment of our distribution network reflecting freestanding store and certain department store closures with a focus on north america and europe the middle east  africa the reduction in brickandmortar point of sale employees and related support staff and the redesign of our regional branded marketing organizations plus select opportunities in global brands and functions this program is expected to position us to better execute our longterm strategy while strengthening our financial flexibility 

we previously estimated a net reduction over the duration of the pcba program in the range of approximately 2000 to 2500 positions globally including temporary and parttime employees we have revised these estimates based on the review of the pcba program as of june 30 2022 we estimate a net reduction over the duration of the pcba program in the range of 2500 to 3000 positions globally including temporary and parttime employees this reduction takes into account the elimination of some positions retraining and redeployment of certain employees and investment in new positions in key areas we also estimate the closure over the duration of the pcba program of approximately 10 to 15 of our freestanding stores globally primarily in europe the middle east  africa and in north america 

we approved specific initiatives under the pcba program through fiscal 2022 and expect to substantially complete those initiatives through fiscal 2023 we previously estimated that the pcba program would result in related restructuring and other charges totaling between 400 million and 500 million before taxes after concluding the final approvals and reviewing the progress of previously approved initiatives under the pcba program that are being implemented we have revised our estimates for cost approvals under the pcba program inclusive of approvals from inception through june 28 2022 we now estimate that the pcba program may result in related restructuring and other charges totaling between 500 million and 515 million before taxes 

we previously expected once fully implemented the pcba program to yield annual benefits primarily in selling general and administrative expenses of between 300 million and 400 million before taxes as of june 30 2022 we now expect once fully implemented the pcba program to yield annual benefits primarily in selling general and administrative expenses of between 390 million and 410 million before taxes we expect to reinvest a portion of the savings behind future growth initiatives

impairment testing 

we assess goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets at least annually for impairment or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist 

during the fiscal 2022 third quarter given the lowerthanexpected results from international expansion to areas that continue to be impacted by covid19 we made revisions to the internal forecasts relating to our glamglow reporting unit we concluded that the changes in circumstances in the reporting unit triggered the need for an interim impairment review of its trademark intangible asset the remaining carrying value of the trademark intangible asset was not recoverable and we recorded an impairment charge of 11 million reducing the carrying value to zero 

during the fiscal 2022 third quarter given the lowerthanexpected growth within key geographic regions and channels for drjart that continue to be impacted by the spread of covid19 variants and resurgence in cases and the potential future impacts relating to the uncertainty of the duration and severity of covid19 impacting the financial performance of the brand the lower than expected growth in key retail channels for deciem and the lower than expected results from international expansion to areas that continue to be impacted by covid19 for too faced we made revisions to the internal forecasts relating to the drjart deciem and too faced reporting units 

we concluded that the changes in circumstances in the reporting units triggered the need for interim impairment reviews of their trademarks and goodwill these changes in circumstances were also an indicator that the carrying amounts of drjart’s deciem’s and too faced’s longlived assets including customer lists may not be recoverable accordingly we performed interim impairment tests for the trademarks and a recoverability test for the longlived assets as of february 28 2022 we concluded that the carrying amounts of the longlived assets were recoverable for the drjart reporting unit we also concluded that the carrying value of the trademark intangible asset exceeded its estimated fair value which was determined utilizing the relieffromroyalty method to determine discounted projected future cash flows and recorded an impairment charge of 205 million for the too faced and deciem reporting units as the carrying values of the trademarks did not exceed their estimated fair values which were determined utilizing the relieffromroyalty method to determine discounted projected future cash flows we did not record impairment charges the estimated fair values of too faced’s and deciems trademarks exceeded their carrying values by 13 and 3 respectively for the too faced and deciem trademark intangible assets if all other assumptions are held constant an increase of 100 basis points and 50 basis points respectively in the weighted average cost of capital would result in an impairment charge after adjusting the carrying values of the trademarks we completed interim quantitative impairment tests for goodwill as the estimated fair value of the drjart deciem and too faced reporting units were in excess of their carrying values we concluded that the carrying amounts of the goodwill were recoverable and did not record a goodwill impairment charge related to these reporting units the fair values of these reporting units were based upon an equal weighting of the income and market approaches utilizing estimated cash flows and a terminal value discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows as well as valuation multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies that are applied to operating performance of the reporting units the significant assumptions used in these approaches include revenue growth rates and profit margins terminal values weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and royalty rates for trademarks the most significant unobservable input used to estimate the fair value of the drjart trademark intangible asset was the weightedaverage cost of capital which was 105 

based on our annual goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible asset impairment testing as of april 1 2022 we determined that the carrying value of the drjart trademark exceeded its fair value this determination was made based on updated internal forecasts given the lowerthanexpected growth within key geographic regions and channels that continued to be impacted by the spread of covid19 variants the resurgence in cases regional lockdowns and the potential future impacts relating to the uncertainty of the duration and severity of covid19 impacting the financial performance of the brand we made revisions to the internal forecasts relating to the drjart reporting unit these changes in circumstances were also indicators that the carrying amounts of their respective longlived assets may not be recoverable we concluded that the carrying value of the trademark intangible asset exceeded its estimated fair value which was determined utilizing the relieffromroyalty method to determine discounted projected future cash flows and recorded an impairment charge of 25 million we concluded that the carrying amount of the longlived assets were recoverable after adjusting the carrying value of the trademark we completed a quantitative impairment test for goodwill as the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was in excess of its carrying value we concluded that the carrying amount of the goodwill was recoverable and did not record a goodwill impairment charge related to the reporting unit the fair value of the reporting unit was based upon an equal weighting of the income and market approaches utilizing estimated cash flows and a terminal value discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows as well as valuation multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies that are applied to operating performance of the reporting units the significant assumptions used in these approaches include revenue growth rates and profit margins terminal values weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and royalty rates for trademarks the most significant unobservable input used to estimate the fair value of the trademark intangible asset was the weightedaverage cost of capital which was 105 

a summary of the trademark impairment charges for the three and twelve months ended june 30 2022 and the remaining carrying values as of june 30 2022 for each reporting unit are as follows 



the impairment charges for the three and twelve months ended june 30 2022 were reflected in the skin care product category 

the fair values of all reporting units which were determined based on quantitative assessments with goodwill were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values with the exception of the deciem reporting unit the carrying value of the deciem reporting unit as of june 30 2022 approximated its fair value 

the fair value of the drjart trademark was equal to its carrying value subsequent to the impairment charge taken as of april 1 2022 additionally the fair values of the smashbox deciem and too faced trademark intangible assets approximated their carrying values as of april 1 2022 the key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of the reporting unit are primarily predicated on the estimated future impacts of covid19 the success of future new product launches the achievement of distribution expansion plans and the realization of cost reduction and other efficiency efforts if such plans do not materialize or if there are further challenges in the business environments in which the reporting unit operates resulting changes in the key assumptions could have negative impacts on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and it is possible we could recognize additional impairment charges in the future

reconciliations of nongaap financial measures 

we use certain nongaap financial measures among other financial measures to evaluate our operating performance which represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business management believes that excluding certain items that are not comparable from period to period or do not reflect the company’s underlying ongoing business provides transparency for such items and helps investors and others compare and analyze our operating performance from period to period in the future we expect to incur charges or adjustments similar in nature to those presented below however the impact to the company’s results in a given period may be highly variable and difficult to predict our nongaap financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by or determined in a manner consistent with other companies while we consider the nongaap measures useful in analyzing our results they are not intended to replace or act as a substitute for any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with us gaap the following tables present net sales operating income and diluted net earnings per common share adjusted to exclude the impact of charges associated with restructuring and other activities goodwill other intangible and longlived asset impairments other income net the changes in fair value of contingent consideration the change in fair value of acquisitionrelated stock options and the effects of foreign currency translation the following tables provide reconciliations between these nongaap financial measures and the most directly comparable us gaap measures

financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program borrowings from the issuance of longterm debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks and other lenders in the united states and abroad at june 30 2022 we had cash and cash equivalents of 3957 million compared with 4958 million at june 30 2021 our cash and cash equivalents are maintained at a number of financial institutions to mitigate the risk of uninsured balances we select financial institutions based on their credit ratings and financial strength and we perform ongoing evaluations of these institutions to limit our concentration risk exposure 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that cash on hand cash generated from operations available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support seasonal working capital needs currently planned business operations information technology enhancements capital expenditures acquisitions dividends stock repurchases restructuring initiatives commitments and other contractual obligations on both a nearterm and longterm basis 

the tcja resulted in the transition tax on unrepatriated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and changed the tax law in ways that present opportunities to repatriate cash without additional us federal income tax as a result we changed our indefinite reinvestment assertion related to certain foreign earnings and we continue to analyze the indefinite reinvestment assertion on our remaining applicable foreign earnings we do not believe that continuing to reinvest our foreign earnings impairs our ability to meet our domestic debt or working capital obligations if these reinvested earnings were repatriated into the united states as dividends we would be subject to state income taxes and applicable foreign taxes in certain jurisdictions 

the effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years however we are mindful of increasing inflationary pressures generally we have been able to introduce new products at higher prices increase prices and implement other operating efficiencies to sufficiently offset cost increases 

credit ratings 

changes in our credit ratings will likely result in changes in our borrowing costs our credit ratings also impact the cost of our revolving credit facility downgrades in our credit ratings may reduce our ability to issue commercial paper andor longterm debt and would likely increase the relative costs of borrowing a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating as of august 17 2022 our longterm debt is rated a with a stable outlook by standard  poor’s and a1 with a stable outlook by moody’s 

debt and access to liquidity 

total debt as a percent of total capitalization excluding noncontrolling interests increased to 49 at june 30 2022 from 48 at june 30 2021 

for further information regarding our current and longterm debt and available financing see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 11 – debt  

cash flows 



the change in net cash flows provided by operations reflected higher working capital needs to support growth and to mitigate the global supply chain challenges as well as higher cash paid for taxes partially offset by higher earnings before taxes excluding noncash items 

the change in net cash flows used for investing activities primarily reflected cash paid net of cash acquired in connection with the acquisition of additional shares in deciem in fiscal 2021 and the settlement of net investment hedges these changes were partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures primarily driven by increased investments for a new manufacturing facility in japan online capabilities our freestanding stores and counters at retailers to support new and existing distribution and information technology enhancements as well as investments to support the reopening of our offices located around the world which were previously closed due to covid19 

the change in net cash flows used for financing activities primarily reflected an increase relating to higher treasury stock repurchases in fiscal 2022 and proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt net in the prioryear period partially offset by the repayment of shortterm debt and repayments and redemptions of longterm debt made in the prioryear period

pension and postretirement plan funding 

several factors influence the annual funding requirements for our pension plans for our domestic trustbased noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan “us qualified plan” we seek to maintain appropriate funded percentages for any future contributions to the us qualified plan we would seek to contribute an amount or amounts that would not be less than the minimum required by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended “erisa” and subsequent pension legislation and would not be more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes for each international plan our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations in addition amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions  the effect of our pension plan funding on future operating results will depend on economic conditions employee demographics mortality rates the number of participants electing to take lumpsum distributions investment performance and funding decisions 

for the us qualified plan we maintain an investment strategy of matching the duration of a substantial portion of the plan assets with the duration of the underlying plan liabilities this strategy assists us in maintaining our overall funded ratio for fiscal 2022 and 2021 we met or exceeded all contribution requirements under erisa regulations for the us qualified plan as we continue to monitor the funded status we may decide to make cash contributions to the us qualified plan or our postretirement medical plan in the united states during fiscal 2023 

the following table summarizes actual and expected benefit payments and contributions for our other pension and postretirement plans

credit risk 

for a discussion of credit risk see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 12 – derivative financial instruments credit risk  

market risk 

we address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of market risk management that includes the use of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates and to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet to perform a sensitivity analysis of our foreign currency forward contracts we assess the change in fair values from the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates a hypothetical 10 weakening of the us dollar against the foreign exchange rates for the currencies in our portfolio would have resulted in a net decrease in the fair value of our portfolio of approximately 259 million and 218 million as of june 30 2022 and 2021 respectively this potential change does not consider our underlying foreign currency exposures 

in addition we enter into interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on our aggregate liability portfolio including future debt issuances based on a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates the estimated fair value of our interest rate derivatives would decrease by approximately 41 million and 83 million as of june 30 2022 and 2021 respectively 

our sensitivity analysis represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may or may not occur it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated based upon actual fluctuations in market rates operating exposures and the timing thereof and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year we believe however that any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the derivative financial instrument was intended 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not maintain any offbalance sheet arrangements transactions obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations 

recently issued accounting standards 

refer to item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 2 – summary of significant accounting policies for discussion regarding the impact of accounting standards that were recently issued but not yet effective on our consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition at june 30 2022 and our results of operations for the three fiscal years ended june 30 2022 are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements these estimates and assumptions can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates we consider accounting estimates to be critical if both i the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and ii the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to the company’s financial condition our critical accounting policies relate to goodwill other intangible assets and longlived assets  impairment assessment and income taxes 

management of the company has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of the company’s board of directors 

goodwill other intangible assets and longlived assets – impairment assessment 

goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets other indefinitelived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized 

when testing goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment we have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test if necessary we can perform a single step quantitative goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and record an impairment charge for the amount that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value up to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit for fiscal 2022 we elected to perform the quantitative assessment for the goodwill in each of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets we engaged a thirdparty valuation specialist and used industry accepted valuation models and criteria that were reviewed and approved by various levels of management for fiscal 2021 we elected to perform the qualitative assessment for the goodwill in certain of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets this qualitative assessment included the review of certain macroeconomic factors and entityspecific qualitative factors to determine if it was morelikelythannot that the fair values of our reporting units were below carrying value for our other reporting units and other indefinitelived intangible assets a quantitative assessment was performed we engaged thirdparty valuation specialists and used industry accepted valuation models and criteria that were reviewed and approved by various levels of management 

for further discussion of the methods used and factors considered in our estimates as part of the impairment testing for goodwill other intangible assets and longlived assets see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 2 – summary of significant accounting policies  note 6 – goodwill and other intangible assets  

income taxes 

we calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate as the application of various tax laws relevant to our global business is often uncertain significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions the provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable for the current year the effect of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis net operating losses tax credits and other carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates when the assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled we regularly review deferred tax assets for realizability and establish valuation allowances based on available evidence including historical operating losses projected future taxable income expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and appropriate tax planning strategies if our assessment of the realizability of a deferred tax asset changes an increase to a valuation allowance will result in a reduction to net earnings at that time while the reduction to a valuation allowance will result in an increase to net earnings at that time 

we provide tax reserves for applicable us federal state local and foreign tax exposures relating to periods subject to audit the development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues potential outcomes and timing and is a subjective critical estimate we assess our tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting dates for those tax positions where it is morelikelythannot that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those tax positions where it is morelikelythannot that a tax benefit will not be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements we classify applicable interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes although the outcome relating to these exposures is uncertain in our opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating from these exposures if actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates they could have a material impact on our consolidated net earnings

the covid19 pandemic has had a significant impact on consumer behaviors and has accelerated the trend for a digitalfirst consumer journey and ecommerce this provided a catalyst for redesigning each brands “hightouch” experience and accelerated changes to our directtoconsumer business models and consumer engagement programs such as selling through social media and web conferencing platforms “virtual selling” these models and programs continue to provide distinct onetoone and onetomany “hightouch” omnichannel services and personalized experiences by leveraging technology and our talented beauty advisors consultants and makeup artists

manufacturing warehousing and raw materials 

we manufacture our products primarily in our own facilities in the united states belgium switzerland the united kingdom and canada and also leverage global thirdparty manufacturing networks we continue to streamline our manufacturing processes and identify sourcing opportunities to improve innovation increase efficiencies minimize our impact on the environment ensure supply sufficiency and reduce costs our plants are modern and our manufacturing processes are substantially automated in fiscal 2021 we began construction of a new manufacturing facility near tokyo which is expected to enable us to better meet demand and increase speed to market in the asiapacific region construction is in progress and the facility is expected to be operational in early fiscal 2023 while we believe that our manufacturing network of internal and external sites is sufficient to meet current and reasonably anticipated increased requirements we continue to implement improvements in capacity technology and productivity and align our manufacturing with regional sales demand to be more agile from timetotime demand changes may challenge our capacity for certain subcategories on a shortterm basis but we believe this will not impact our ability to meet our annual or longterm strategic objectives 

we have established a flexible global distribution network of logistic providers that are managed by us or third parties the network is designed to meet the changing demands of our customers while maintaining service levels we are continuously evaluating and adjusting this physical distribution network particularly as we work to anticipate and respond to channel shifts we have established regional and local distribution centers including those maintained by third parties strategically positioned throughout the world in order to facilitate efficient delivery of our products to our customers and consumers

some of our products rely on singlesource or a limited number of suppliers however we believe we have a robust business continuity strategy sophisticated capacity planning tools and strategic inventory buffer and multisourcing solutions in the past we have been able to obtain an adequate supply of essential raw materials and packaging components for virtually all materials used in the production of our products we currently believe we have adequate resources of supply and that our portfolio of suppliers has the resources and facilities to overcome most unforeseen interruptions of supply 

we are continually benchmarking the performance of our supply chain and we augment our supply base and adjust our distribution networks and manufacturing plants and networks based upon the changing needs of the business as we integrate acquired brands we continually seek new ways to leverage our production and sourcing capabilities to improve our overall supply chain performance 

as a response to the covid19 pandemic we have leveraged our network of global supply manufacturing and distribution to help mitigate disruption to our supply chain and help enable our return to normal operations by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and throughout fiscal 2021 all of our manufacturing and distribution facilities were operating at sufficient levels

there are risks associated with an investment in our securities please consider the following risks and all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k and in our subsequent filings with the securities and exchange commission “sec” our business may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial if any of the events contemplated by the following discussion of risks should occur or other risks arise or develop our business which includes our prospects financial condition and results of operations the trading prices of our securities and our reputation may be adversely affected 

risks related to our business and our industry 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic could materially adversely affect our financial results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and difficult to predict 

the outbreak and global spread of the covid19 pandemic has continued to significantly disrupt our operating environment including retail stores travel retail and the ability of some of our customers to operate we have also seen shifts in consumer preferences and practices 

considerable uncertainty remains regarding this pandemic including responsive measures being taken by various authorities and others as we continue to monitor covid19 developments including the impacts on our consumers customers and suppliers we have taken and will continue to take further measures some of the actions we take could adversely impact our business and there is no certainty that our actions will be sufficient to mitigate the risks and the impacts of covid19 

the degree to which covid19 continues to impact our business will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted many of which are outside our control including the extent to which there are sustainable improvements in the retail environment and general economic conditions 

the beauty business is highly competitive and if we are unable to compete effectively our results will suffer 

we face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world including multinational consumer product companies some competitors have greater resources than we do others are newer companies some backed by privateequity investors and some are competing in distribution channels where we are less represented in some cases we may not be able to respond to changing business and economic conditions as quickly as our competitors competition in the beauty business is based on a variety of factors including pricing of products innovation perceived value service to the consumer promotional activities advertising special events new product introductions ecommerce and mcommerce initiatives and other activities it is difficult for us to predict the timing and scale of our competitors’ actions in these areas 

our ability to compete also depends on the continued strength of our brands our ability to attract and retain key talent and other personnel the efficiency of our manufacturing facilities and distribution network and our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property and those other rights used in our business our company has a wellrecognized and strong reputation that could be negatively impacted by social media and many other factors if our reputation is adversely affected our ability to attract and retain customers and consumers could be impacted in addition certain of our key retailers around the world market and sell competing brands or are owned or otherwise affiliated with companies that market and sell competing brands our inability to continue to compete effectively in key countries around the world could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our inability to anticipate and respond to market trends and changes in consumer preferences could adversely affect our financial results 

our continued success depends on our ability to anticipate gauge and react in a timely and costeffective manner to changes in consumer preferences for skin care makeup fragrance and hair care products attitudes toward our industry and brands as well as to where and how consumers shop we must continually work to develop manufacture and market new products maintain and adapt our “hightouch” services to existing and emerging distribution channels maintain and enhance the recognition of our brands achieve a favorable mix of products successfully manage our inventories and modernize and refine our approach as to how and where we market and sell our products we recognize that consumer preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and can change rapidly driven by the use of digital and social media by consumers and the speed by which information and opinions are shared if we are unable to anticipate and respond to sudden challenges that we may face in the marketplace trends in the market for our products and changing consumer demands and sentiment our financial results will suffer in addition from time to time sales growth or profitability may be concentrated in a relatively small number of our brands channels or countries if such a situation persists or a number of brands channels or countries fail to perform as expected there could be a material adverse effect on our business 

in key markets such as the united states we have seen a decline in retail traffic in our department store customers and in our freestanding stores we continue to see the shift in consumer preference to the online channel which accelerated in response to the covid19 pandemic consolidation or liquidation in the retail trade from these or other factors may result in us becoming increasingly dependent on key retailers and could result in an increased risk related to the concentration of our customers a severe adverse impact on the business operations of our customers could have a corresponding material adverse effect on us if one or more of our largest customers change their strategies including pricing or promotional activities enter bankruptcy or similar proceedings or if our relationship with any large customer is changed or terminated for any reason there could be a material adverse effect on our business 

our future success depends in part on our ability to achieve our longterm strategy 

achieving our longterm strategy will require investment in new capabilities brands categories distribution channels supply chain facilities technologies and emerging and more mature geographic markets these investments may result in shortterm costs without any current sales and therefore may be dilutive to our earnings in addition we may dispose of or discontinue select brands or streamline operations and incur costs or restructuring and other charges in doing so although we believe that our strategy will lead to longterm growth in sales and profitability we may not realize the anticipated benefits the failure to realize benefits which may be due to our inability to execute plans global or local economic conditions competition changes in the beauty industry and the other risks described herein could have a material adverse effect on our business 

acquisitions and divestitures may expose us to additional risks 

we continuously review acquisition and strategic investment opportunities that would expand our current product offerings our distribution channels increase the size and geographic scope of our operations or otherwise offer growth and operating efficiency opportunities in addition we periodically review our brand portfolio and our strategy includes potential divestitures of certain brands as we rationalize product offerings there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify these strategic actions and consummate such transactions on favorable terms 

acquisitions including strategic investments or alliances entail numerous risks which may include i difficulties in integrating acquired operations or products including the loss of key employees from or customers consumers or suppliers of acquired businesses ii diversion of management’s attention from our existing businesses iii adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers customers and consumers of ours or the companies in which we invest iv adverse impacts of margin and product cost structures different from those of our current mix of business v reputational risks associated with the activities of the businesses that we acquire or in which we invest and vi risks of entering distribution channels categories or markets in which we have limited or no prior experience 

if required the financing for these transactions could result in an increase in our indebtedness dilute the interests of our stockholders or both the purchase price for some acquisitions may include additional amounts to be paid in cash in the future a portion of which may be contingent on the achievement of certain future operating results of the acquired business if the performance of any such acquired business exceeds such operating results then we may incur additional charges and be required to pay additional amounts 

completed acquisitions typically result in additional goodwill andor an increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet we are required at least annually or as facts and circumstances exist to test goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to determine if impairment has occurred we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired there could be a material adverse effect on our business 

our failure to achieve the longterm plan for acquired businesses as well as any other adverse consequences associated with our acquisition divestiture and investment activities could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our business could be negatively impacted by social impact and sustainability matters 

there is an increased focus from certain investors customers consumers employees and other stakeholders concerning social impact and sustainability matters from time to time we announce certain initiatives including goals and commitments regarding our focus areas which include environmental matters packaging responsible sourcing social investments and inclusion and diversity we could fail or be perceived to fail in our achievement of such initiatives or in accurately reporting our progress on such initiatives such failures could be due to changes in our business eg shifts in business among distribution channels or acquisitions moreover the standards by which citizenship and sustainability efforts and related matters are measured are developing and evolving and certain areas are subject to assumptions that could change over time in addition we could be criticized for the scope of our initiatives or goals or perceived as not acting responsibly in connection with these matters any such matters or related social impact and sustainability matters could have a material adverse effect on our business 

a general economic downturn or sudden disruption in business conditions may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items andor the financial strength of our customers that are retailers which could adversely affect our financial results 

the general level of consumer spending is affected by a number of factors including general economic conditions inflation interest rates energy costs and consumer confidence generally all of which are beyond our control consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower and may impact sales of our products a decline in consumer purchases of discretionary items also tends to impact our customers that are retailers we generally extend credit to a retailer based on an evaluation of its financial condition usually without requiring collateral however the financial difficulties of a retailer could cause us to curtail or eliminate business with that customer we may also assume more credit risk relating to the receivables from that retailer in the event of a retailer liquidation we may incur additional costs if we choose to purchase the retailer’s inventory of our products to protect brand equity our inability to collect receivables from our largest customers or from a group of customers could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in addition sudden disruptions in local or global business conditions for example from events such as a pandemic or other health issues geopolitical or local conflicts civil unrest terrorist attacks adverse weather conditions climate changes or seismic events can have a shortterm and sometimes longterm impact on consumer spending 

events that impact consumers’ willingness or ability to travel or purchase our products while traveling may impact our business including travel retail a significant contributor to our overall results and our strategy to market and sell products to international travelers at their destinations 

a downturn in the economies of or continuing recessions in the countries where we sell our products or a sudden disruption of business conditions in those countries could adversely affect consumer confidence the financial strength of our retailers and our sales and profitability we are also cautious of foreign currency movements including their impact on tourism additionally we continue to monitor the effects of the global macroeconomic environment social political and human rights issues regulatory matters including the imposition of tariffs geopolitical tensions and global security issues 

volatility in the financial markets and a related economic downturn in key markets or markets generally throughout the world could have a material adverse effect on our business while we typically generate significant cash flows from our ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities credit markets may experience significant disruptions deterioration in global financial markets or an adverse change in our credit ratings could make future financing difficult or more expensive if any financial institutions that are parties to our revolving credit facility or other financing arrangements such as foreign exchange or interest rate hedging instruments were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us this could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain foreign currency or interest rate exposures which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our success depends in part on the quality efficacy and safety of our products 

our success depends in part on the quality efficacy and safety of our products if our products are found to be defective or unsafe our product claims are found to be deceptive or our products otherwise fail to meet our consumers’ expectations our relationships with customers or consumers could suffer the appeal of our brands could be diminished and we could lose sales and become subject to liability or claims any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business in addition counterfeit versions of some of our products may be sold by third parties which may pose safety risks may fail to meet consumers’ expectations and may have a negative impact on our business 

our success depends in part on our key personnel 

our success depends in part on our ability to retain our key personnel including our executive officers and senior management team the unexpected loss of or misconduct by one or more of our key employees could adversely affect our business our success also depends in part on our continuing ability to identify hire train and retain personnel across all levels of our business competition for employees can be intense we may not be able to attract assimilate or retain necessary personnel in the future and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business this risk may be exacerbated by the stresses associated with the implementation of our strategic plan and other initiatives as well as by market conditions 

we are subject to risks related to the global scope of our operations 

we operate on a global basis with a majority of our fiscal 2021 net sales and operating income generated outside the united states we maintain offices in over 50 countries and have key operational facilities located inside and outside the united states that manufacture warehouse or distribute goods for sale throughout the world our global operations are subject to many risks and uncertainties including i fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and the relative costs of operating in different places which can affect our results of operations the value of our foreign assets the relative prices at which we and competitors sell products in the same markets the cost of certain inventory and noninventory items required in our operations and the relative prices at which we sell our products in different markets ii foreign or us laws regulations and policies including restrictions on trade immigration and travel operations and investments currency exchange controls restrictions on imports and exports including license requirements tariffs and taxes iii lack of wellestablished or reliable legal and administrative systems in certain countries in which we operate iv adverse weather conditions and natural disasters and v social economic and geopolitical conditions such as a pandemic terrorist attack war or other military action these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business 

a disruption in our operations or supply chain could adversely affect our business 

as a company engaged in manufacturing and distribution on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including industrial accidents environmental events strikes and other labor disputes capacity constraints disruptions in ingredient material or packaging supply as well as global shortages disruptions in supply chain or information technology loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites or suppliers product quality control safety increase in commodity prices and energy costs licensing requirements and other regulatory issues as well as natural disasters and other external factors over which we have no control if such an event were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we use a wide variety of direct and indirect suppliers of goods and services from around the world some of our products rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers could subject us to losses or adversely affect our ability to bring products to market further the failure of our suppliers to deliver goods and services in sufficient quantities in compliance with applicable standards and in a timely manner could adversely affect our customer service levels and overall business in addition any increases in the costs of goods and services for our business may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies in our operations 

as we outsource functions we become more dependent on the entities performing those functions 

as part of our longterm strategy we are continually looking for opportunities to provide essential business services in a more costeffective manner in some cases this requires the outsourcing of functions or parts of functions that can be performed more effectively by external service providers these include certain information technology supply chain finance and human resource functions the failure of one or more such providers to deliver the expected services provide them on a timely basis or to provide them at the prices we expect may have a material adverse effect on our business in addition when we transition external service providers we may experience challenges that could have a material adverse effect on our business 

risks related to legal and regulatory matters 

changes in laws regulations and policies that affect our business could adversely affect our financial results 

our business is subject to numerous laws regulations and policies around the world changes in these laws regulations and policies including the interpretation or enforcement thereof that affect our business could adversely affect our financial results these changes include accounting standards laws and regulations relating to tax matters trade data privacy eg general data protection regulation gdpr anticorruption advertising marketing manufacturing distribution customs matters product registration ingredients chemicals packaging selective distribution environmental or climate change matters 

disputes and other legal or regulatory proceedings could adversely affect our financial results 

we are and may in the future become party to litigation other disputes or regulatory proceedings across a wide range of matters including ones relating to employment real estate environmental regulatory advertising trade relations tax privacy and product liability matters including asbestosrelated claims in general claims made by us or against us in litigation disputes or other proceedings can be expensive and time consuming and could result in settlements injunctions or damages that could significantly affect our business it is not possible to predict the final resolution of the litigation disputes or proceedings to which we currently are or may in the future become party to and the impact of certain of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business  

government reviews inquiries investigations and actions could harm our business 

as we operate in various locations around the world our operations are subject to governmental scrutiny and may be adversely impacted by the results of such scrutiny the regulatory environment with regard to our business is evolving and officials often exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply applicable regulations from time to time we may receive formal and informal inquiries from various government regulatory authorities as well as selfregulatory organizations about our business and compliance with local laws regulations or standards any determination that our operations or activities or the activities of our employees are not in compliance with existing laws regulations or standards could negatively impact us in a number of ways including the imposition of substantial fines interruptions of business loss of supplier vendor or other thirdparty relationships termination of necessary licenses and permits or similar results all of which could potentially harm our business regardless of the outcomes these reviews inquiries investigations and actions could create negative publicity which could harm our business 

risks related to technology and cybersecurity matters 

our information technology and websites may be susceptible to cybersecurity breaches outages and other risks 

we rely on information technology that supports our business processes including product development marketing sales order processing production distribution finance and intracompany communications throughout the world we have ecommerce mcommerce and other internet websites in the united states and many other countries these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire floods power loss telecommunications failures breakins and other events our systems and data may be vulnerable to constantly evolving cybersecurity threats such as malware breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering the occurrence of these or other events could disrupt or damage our information technology including operational technology and adversely affect our business insurance policies that may provide coverage with regard to such events may not cover any or all of the resulting financial losses 

failure to adequately maintain the security of our electronic and other confidential information could materially adversely affect our business 

we are dependent upon automated information technology processes as part of our normal business activities we collect and store certain information that is confidential proprietary or otherwise sensitive including personal information with respect to customers consumers and employees we share some of this information with certain vendors who assist us with business matters moreover the success of our ecommerce and mcommerce operations depends upon the secure transmission of confidential and personal data over public networks including the use of cashless payments any failure on the part of us or our vendors to maintain the security of our confidential data and personal information including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information could result in business disruption damage to our reputation financial obligations to third parties fines penalties regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs and also result in deterioration in our employees’ consumers’ and customers’ confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition a security or data privacy breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to enhance our information security systems and could result in a disruption to our operations furthermore third parties including our suppliers and customers also rely on information technology and may be subject to cybersecurity breaches that could impact their businesses and could in turn disrupt our supply chain andor our business 

we are subject to risks associated with our global information technology 

our implementation maintenance and utilization of global information technology including operational technology supply chain and finance systems human resource management systems creative asset management and retail operating systems as well as associated hardware and use of cloudbased models involve risks and uncertainties failure to implement maintain or utilize these and other systems as planned in terms of timing specifications security policies costs or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business 

risks related to our securities and our ownership structure 

the trading prices of our securities periodically may rise or fall based on the accuracy of predictions of our financial performance 

our business planning process is designed to maximize our longterm strength growth and profitability not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter we believe that this longerterm focus is in the best interests of the company and our stockholders at the same time however we recognize that it may be helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our expectations regarding certain aspects of our business this could include forecasts of net sales earnings per share and other financial metrics or projections we assume no responsibility to provide or update guidance and any longerterm guidance we may provide is based on goals that we believe at the time guidance is given are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years we historically have paid dividends on our common stock and repurchased shares of our class a common stock however at times we have suspended the declaration of dividends andor the repurchase of our class a common stock going forward at any time we could stop or suspend payment of dividends or stop or suspend our stock repurchase program and any such action could cause the market price of our stock to decline 

in all of our public statements when we make or update a forwardlooking statement about our business whether it be about net sales or earnings expectations or expectations regarding restructuring or other initiatives or otherwise we accompany such statements directly or by reference to a public document with a list of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we expect such a list is included among other places in our earnings press release and in our periodic filings with the sec eg in our reports on form 10k and form 10q these and other factors may make it difficult for us and for outside observers such as research analysts to predict what our earnings or other financial metrics or business outcomes will be in any given fiscal quarter or year 

outside analysts and investors have the right to make their own predictions of our business for any future period outside analysts however have access to no more material information about our results or plans than any other public investor and we do not endorse their predictions as to our future performance nor do we assume any responsibility to correct the predictions of outside analysts or others when they differ from our own internal expectations if our actual results differ from those that outside analysts or others have been predicting the market price of our securities could be affected investors who rely on the predictions of outside analysts or others when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk we take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in the prices of our securities 

we are controlled by the lauder family as a result the lauder family has the ability to prevent or cause a change in control or approve prevent or influence certain actions by us 

as of august 20 2021 members of the lauder family beneficially own directly or indirectly shares of the company’s class a common stock with one vote per share and class b common stock with 10 votes per share having approximately 85 of the outstanding voting power of the common stock in addition there are four members of the lauder family who are company employees and members of our board of directors 

as a result of their stock ownership and positions at the company as well as our dualclass structure the lauder family has the ability to exercise significant control and influence over our business including all matters requiring stockholder approval eg the election of directors amendments to the certificate of incorporation and significant corporate transactions such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets for the foreseeable future in addition if significant stock indices decide to prohibit the inclusion of companies with dualclass stock structures the price of our class a common stock could be negatively impacted and could become more volatile 

we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the new york stock exchange rules and as a result are relying on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that are designed to provide protection to stockholders of companies that are not “controlled companies” 

the lauder family and their related entities own more than 50 of the total voting power of our common shares and as a result we are a “controlled company” under the new york stock exchange corporate governance standards as a controlled company we are exempt under the new york stock exchange standards from the obligation to comply with certain new york stock exchange corporate governance requirements including the requirements that 1 a majority of our board of directors consists of independent directors 2 we have a nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities and 3 we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities 

while we have voluntarily caused our board to have a majority of independent directors and the written charters of our nominating and esg committee and the compensation committee to have the required provisions we are not requiring our nominating and esg committee and compensation committee to be comprised solely of independent directors as a result of our use of the “controlled company” exemptions investors will not have the same protection afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the new york stock exchange corporate governance requirements

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

results of operations 

we manufacture market and sell beauty products including those in the skin care makeup fragrance and hair care categories which are distributed in approximately 150 countries and territories the following table is a comparative summary of operating results for fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 and reflects the basis of presentation described in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 2 – summary of significant accounting policies and note 22 – segment data and related information for all periods presented products and services that do not meet our definition of skin care makeup fragrance and hair care have been included in the “other” category 



1 the net sales from our travel retail business are included in the europe the middle east  africa region with the exception of the net sales of dr jart in the travel retail channel that are reflected in korea in the asiapacific region operating income attributable to the travel retail sales included in europe the middle east  africa is included in that region and in the americas 

during fiscal 2020 changes were made to reflect certain leading beauty forward enhancements made to the capabilities and cost structure of our travel retail business which are primarily centralized in the americas region and resulted in a change to the royalty structure of the travel retail business to reflect the value created in the americas region accordingly the fiscal 2019 operating income of the americas was increased with a corresponding decrease in europe the middle east  africa by 866 million to conform with the fiscal 2021 and 2020 methodology and presentation 

the following table presents certain consolidated earnings data as a percentage of net sales 



we continually introduce new products support new and established products through advertising merchandising and sampling and phase out existing products that no longer meet the needs of our consumers or our objectives the economics of developing producing launching supporting and discontinuing products impact our sales and operating performance each period the introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products which we take into account in our business planning 

nongaap financial measures 

we use certain nongaap financial measures among other financial measures to evaluate our operating performance which represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business management believes that excluding certain items that are not comparable from period to period helps investors and others compare operating performance between periods while we consider the nongaap measures useful in analyzing our results they are not intended to replace or act as a substitute for any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with us gaap see reconciliations of nongaap financial measures beginning on page 47 for reconciliations between nongaap financial measures and the most directly comparable us gaap measures 

we operate on a global basis with the majority of our net sales generated outside the united states accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our results of operations therefore we present certain net sales operating results and diluted net earnings per common share information excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations to provide a framework for assessing the performance of our underlying business outside the united states constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant periodoverperiod we calculate constant currency information by translating currentperiod results using prioryear period weightedaverage foreign currency exchange rates and adjusting for the periodoverperiod impact of foreign currency cash flow hedging activities 

overview 

covid19 business update 

the covid19 pandemic continues to disrupt our operating environment including impacts on retail traffic and changes in certain consumer preferences during fiscal 2021 the spread of covid19 as well as the resurgences in covid19 cases and the rapid spread of variants including the delta variant particularly in the united kingdom continental europe latin america and asia outside of china led to government restrictions to prevent further spread of the virus restrictions in many parts of the world at various times during fiscal 2021 have included temporary business closures curtailment of travel mask wearing social distancing and quarantines 

retail impact 

most brickandmortar retail stores that sell our products whether operated by us or our customers were open during the fiscal 2021 second quarter in china and the united states there were intermittent closures throughout the rest of the world particularly in the second half of fiscal 2021 in most of the asiapacific region with the exception of china the united kingdom continental europe canada and much of latin america many retail stores were temporarily closed for some period during the fiscal 2021 fourth quarter due to the resurgence of covid19 cases in much of the united kingdom and continental europe retail locations gradually reopened during the fourth quarter but with capacity and other safety restrictions in place globally in areas where stores were open consumer traffic has not recovered to the precovid19 pandemic levels international travel has remained largely curtailed globally due to both government restrictions and consumer health concerns that continue to adversely impact consumer traffic in most travel retail locations conversely domestic travel in china especially in hainan and some other travel corridors in asiapacific and the americas were open 

somewhat offsetting the significant declines in brickandmortar channels net sales growth of our products online through our own websites thirdparty platforms and websites of our retailers remained strong in every region during fiscal 2021 

due in large part to the continued challenging retail environment and uncertainties stemming from the covid19 pandemic we recognized goodwill other intangible asset and longlive asset impairments see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 6 – goodwill and other intangible assets and note 7 – leases for further information 

consumer preferences 

the covid19 pandemicrelated closures of offices retail stores and other businesses and the significant decline in social gatherings have influenced consumer preferences and practices specifically the demand for makeup continues to be weak given fewer makeup usage occasions and ongoing mask wearing while other categories have been more resilient 

cost controls 

in response to the ongoing impacts from the covid19 pandemic we continue to implement cost control actions in certain areas of the business to effectively manage the changing business environment 

government assistance 

beginning in the second half of fiscal 2020 many governments in locations where we operate announced programs to assist employers whose businesses were impacted by the covid19 pandemic including programs that provide rebates to incentivize employers to maintain employees on payroll who were unable to work for their usual number of hours during fiscal 2021 and 2020 we qualified for and recorded 84 million and 99 million respectively in government assistance which reduced selling general and administrative expenses by 78 million and 87 million respectively and cost of sales by 6 million and 10 million respectively the remaining 2 million recorded in fiscal 2020 was deferred and recognized in fiscal 2021 as a reduction to cost of sales we are continuing to review applicable government assistance programs globally 

we will continue to monitor the impacts of covid19 and adjust our action plans accordingly as the situation progresses

• as part of this strategy we have built a leadership position in the global travel retail channel that historically allowed us to leverage the robust and growing international passenger traffic while covid19 has significantly curtailed international travel in the nearterm we continue to believe that global travel retail is a growth opportunity for the longterm travel retail continues to be an important channel for brand building due to the increase in traveling consumers particularly those from emerging markets who often experience our brands for the first time while traveling we continue to expand our strategic presence in travel retail across dutyfree locations primarily in airports and downtown stores and increasingly through online pretail we engage consumers at the airport through compelling popup activations in nontraditional commercial areas and we ensure we have appropriate communication and curated assortments for targeted consumer groups at the same time travel retail is susceptible to a number of external factors including fluctuations in currency exchange rates and consumers’ willingness and ability to travel and spend

in fiscal 2021 we continued to further integrate social impact and sustainability into our strategy and business operations areas of differentiation include climate  energy green chemistry social investments employee engagement and safety and inclusion diversity  equity other areas of focus include responsible sourcing plastics  packaging ingredient transparency and animal welfare 

outlook 

the covid19 pandemic continues to disrupt business for us retailers and other companies with which we do business there have been and are likely to continue to be intermittent store closures as well as restructurings and bankruptcies in the retail industry including among our customers and shifts in preferences as to where and how consumers shop as well as changes in their preferences for certain products we are mindful that these trends the resurgence of covid19 cases globally and the related government restrictions may continue to impact the pace of recovery the continued curtailment in international travel is also affecting our travel retail business in most of the world which had been historically one of our fastest growth areas in addition to impacting net sales and profitability these and other challenges may adversely impact the goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our brands and the longlived assets in certain of our freestanding stores ie potentially resulting in impairments 

we believe that the best way to increase longterm stockholder value is to continue providing superior products and services in the most efficient and effective manner while recognizing shifts in consumers’ behaviors and shopping practices accordingly our longterm strategy has numerous initiatives across geographic regions product categories brands channels of distribution and functions designed to grow our sales provide cost efficiencies leverage our strengths and make us more productive and profitable we plan to build upon and leverage our history of outstanding creativity and innovation high quality products and services and engaging communications while investing for longterm sustainable growth 

we continue to monitor the effects of the global macroeconomic environment including potential inflation social and political issues regulatory matters including the imposition of tariffs geopolitical tensions and global security issues for example we continue to monitor the geopolitical tensions between the united states and china which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the uncertainty around the timing speed and duration of the recovery from the adverse impacts of the covid19 pandemic will continue to affect our ability to grow sales profitably we believe we can to some extent offset the impact of more ordinary challenges by continually developing and pursuing a diversified strategy with multiple engines of growth and by accelerating initiatives focused on areas of strength discipline and agility and by executing upon our postcovid business acceleration program as the current situation progresses if economic and social conditions or the degree of uncertainty or volatility worsen or the adverse conditions previously described are further prolonged there could be a further negative effect on consumer confidence demand spending and willingness or ability to travel and as a result on our business we are continuing to monitor these and other risks that may affect our business 

leading beauty forward 

in may 2016 we announced a multiyear initiative “leading beauty forward” or the “lbf program” to build on our strengths and better leverage our cost structure to free resources for investment to continue our growth momentum leading beauty forward was designed to enhance our gotomarket capabilities reinforce our leadership in global prestige beauty and our ability to continue creating sustainable value as of june 30 2019 we concluded the approvals of all major initiatives under leading beauty forward related to the optimization of select corporate functions supply chain activities and corporate and regional market support structures as well as the exit of underperforming businesses and have substantially completed those initiatives through fiscal 2021 for additional information about restructuring and other charges see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 8 – charges associated with restructuring and other activities  

postcovid business acceleration program 

on august 20 2020 we announced a twoyear restructuring program postcovid business acceleration program the “pcba program” designed to realign our business to address the dramatic shifts to our distribution landscape and consumer behaviors in the wake of the covid19 pandemic the pcba program is designed to help improve efficiency and effectiveness by rebalancing resources to growth areas of prestige beauty it is expected to further strengthen us by building upon the foundational capabilities in which we have invested 

the pcba program’s main areas of focus include accelerating the shift to online with the realignment of our distribution network reflecting freestanding store and certain department store closures with a focus on north america and europe the middle east  africa the reduction in brickandmortar point of sale employees and related support staff and the redesign of our regional branded marketing organizations plus select opportunities in global brands and functions this program is expected to position us to better execute our longterm strategy while strengthening our financial flexibility 

we previously estimated a net reduction over the duration of the pcba program in the range of approximately 1500 to 2000 positions globally including temporary and parttime employees we have revised these estimates based on the review of the pcba program at this time we estimate a net reduction over the duration of the pcba program in the range of 2000 to 2500 positions globally including temporary and parttime employees this reduction takes into account the elimination of some positions retraining and redeployment of certain employees and investment in new positions in key areas we also estimate the closure over the duration of the pcba program of approximately 10 to 15 of our freestanding stores globally primarily in europe the middle east  africa and in north america 

we plan to approve specific initiatives under the pcba program through fiscal 2022 and expect to complete those initiatives through fiscal 2023 we expect that the pcba program will result in related restructuring and other charges totaling between 400 million and 500 million before taxes consisting of employeerelated costs contract terminations asset writeoffs and other costs to implement these initiatives 

once fully implemented we expect the pcba program to yield annual benefits primarily in selling general and administrative expenses of between 300 million and 400 million before taxes we expect to reinvest a portion behind future growth initiatives for additional information about restructuring and other charges see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 8 – charges associated with restructuring and other activities  

impairment testing 

we assess goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets at least annually for impairment or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist 

during november 2020 given the actual and the estimate of the potential future impacts relating to the uncertainty of the duration and severity of covid19 impacting us and lower than expected results from geographic expansion we made further revisions to the internal forecasts relating to our glamglow reporting unit we concluded that the changes in circumstances in this reporting unit triggered the need for an interim impairment review of its trademark and goodwill these changes in circumstances were also an indicator that the carrying amounts of glamglows longlived assets including customer lists may not be recoverable accordingly we performed an interim impairment test for the trademark and a recoverability test for the longlived assets as of november 30 2020 we concluded that the carrying value of the trademark for glamglow exceeded its estimated fair value which was determined utilizing the relieffromroyalty method to determine discounted projected future cash flows and recorded an impairment charge of 21 million in addition we concluded that the carrying value of the glamglow customer lists intangible asset was fully impaired and recorded an impairment charge of 6 million the fair value of all other longlived assets of glamglow exceeded their carrying values and were not impaired as of november 30 2020 after adjusting the carrying values of the trademark and customer lists intangible assets we completed an interim quantitative impairment test for goodwill and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 54 million reducing the carrying value of goodwill for the glamglow reporting unit to zero the fair value of the glamglow reporting unit was based upon an equal weighting of the income and market approaches utilizing estimated cash flows and a terminal value discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows as well as valuation multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies that are applied to operating performance of the reporting unit 

based on our annual goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible asset impairment testing as of april 1 2021 we determined that the carrying value of the glamglow and smashbox trademarks exceeded their fair values this determination was made based on updated internal forecasts finalized and approved in june 2021 that reflected lower net sales growth projections due to a softer than expected retail environment for these brands as well as the continued impacts relating to the uncertainty of the duration and severity of the covid19 pandemic these changes in circumstances were also indicators that the carrying amounts of their respective longlived assets may not be recoverable we concluded that the carrying values of the trademarks exceeded their estimated fair values which were determined utilizing the relieffromroyalty method to determine discounted projected future cash flows and recorded impairment charges we concluded that the carrying amounts of the longlived assets were recoverable the carrying values of the customer lists and goodwill relating to the glamglow and smashbox reporting units were zero as of november 30 2020 and june 30 2020 respectively 

a summary of the impairment charges for the three and twelve months ended june 30 2021 and the remaining trademark customer lists and goodwill carrying values as of june 30 2021 for each reporting unit are as follows 



the impairment charges for the three and twelve months ended june 30 2021 were reflected in the americas region   

the fair values of all reporting units which were determined based on qualitative or quantitative assessments with material goodwill were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values with the exception of the deciem reporting unit the carrying values of the deciem reporting unit and other intangible assets as of june 30 2021 approximated their fair values 

the fair values of the smashbox and glamglow trademarks were equal to their carrying values subsequent to the impairment charges taken as of april 1 2021 the key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of the reporting units are primarily predicated on the estimated future impacts of covid19 the success of future new product launches the achievement of distribution expansion plans and the realization of cost reduction and other efficiency efforts if such plans do not materialize or if there are further challenges in the business environments in which these reporting units operate resulting changes in the key assumptions could have negative impacts on the estimated fair values of the reporting units and it is possible we could recognize additional impairment charges in the future

the amount paid at closing was funded by cash on hand including the proceeds from the issuance of debt in anticipation of the closing we transferred cash to a foreign subsidiary for purposes of making the closing payment as a result we recognized a foreign currency gain of 23 million which is also included in other income net in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended june 30 2020 

the tax cuts and jobs act the “tcja” which was enacted on december 22 2017 presented us with opportunities to manage cash and investments more efficiently on a global basis accordingly during fiscal 2019 as part of the assessment of those opportunities we sold our availableforsale securities which liquidated our investment in the foreign subsidiary that owned those securities as a result we recorded a realized foreign currency gain on liquidation of 77 million and a gross loss on the sale of availableforsale securities of 6 million both of which were reclassified from accumulated oci and are reflected in other income net for the year ended june 30 2019 see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 2 – summary of significant accounting policies – currency translation and transactions for further information 

provision for income taxes 

the provision for income taxes represents us federal foreign state and local income taxes the effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state and local income taxes the tax impact of sharebased compensation the taxation of foreign income and income tax reserve adjustments which represent changes in our net liability for unrecognized tax benefits including tax settlements and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations our effective tax rate will change from yeartoyear based on recurring and nonrecurring factors including the geographical mix of earnings enacted tax legislation state and local income taxes tax reserve adjustments the tax impact of sharebased compensation the interaction of various global tax strategies and the impact from certain acquisitions 

the tcja included broad and complex changes to the us tax code that impacted our accounting and reporting for income taxes see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 9 – income taxes for further discussion relating to the tcja 



1 for fiscal 2021 and 2020 the basispoint change in our effective tax rate was materially impacted by the increase from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021 and the decrease from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020 respectively in earnings before income taxes 

2 fiscal 2021 and 2020 effective tax rates exclude the net impact on the effective tax rates of charges associated with restructuring and other activities goodwill and other intangible asset impairments other income net and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration there was no tax expense associated with the fiscal 2021 other income net adjustment previously held equity method investment in deciem fiscal 2021 was also adjusted to exclude the deciem stock option expense 

  

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 decreased approximately 1980 basis points the decrease was primarily attributable to a lower effective tax rate on our foreign operations of approximately 920 basis points which included the impact of the us government issuance of final global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” tax regulations in july 2020 under the tcja that provide for a hightax exception to the current and applicable prior years’ gilti tax the impact of the gain on our previously held equity method investment in deciem with no associated tax expense of approximately 530 basis points as well as the prioryear impact of nondeductible goodwill impairment charges associated with our too faced becca and smashbox reporting units of approximately 790 basis points partially offsetting these decreases was a decrease in excess tax benefit credits related to stockbased compensation arrangements of approximately 450 basis points

reconciliations of nongaap financial measures 

we use certain nongaap financial measures among other financial measures to evaluate our operating performance which represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business management believes that excluding certain items that are not comparable from period to period or do not reflect the company’s underlying ongoing business provides transparency for such items and helps investors and others compare and analyze our operating performance from period to period in the future we expect to incur charges or adjustments similar in nature to those presented below however the impact to the company’s results in a given period may be highly variable and difficult to predict our nongaap financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by or determined in a manner consistent with other companies while we consider the nongaap measures useful in analyzing our results they are not intended to replace or act as a substitute for any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with us gaap the following tables present net sales operating income and diluted net earnings per common share adjusted to exclude the impact of charges associated with restructuring and other activities goodwill and other intangible asset impairments longlived asset impairments relating to covid19 other income net the changes in the fair value of contingent consideration acquisitionrelated stock option expense and the effects of foreign currency translation the tables provide reconciliations between these nongaap financial measures and the most directly comparable us gaap measures

financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program borrowings from the issuance of longterm debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks and other lenders in the united states and abroad at june 30 2021 we had cash and cash equivalents of 4958 million compared with 5022 million at june 30 2020 our cash and cash equivalents are maintained at a number of financial institutions to mitigate the risk of uninsured balances we select financial institutions based on their credit ratings and financial strength and we perform ongoing evaluations of these institutions to limit our concentration risk exposure 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that cash on hand cash generated from operations available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support seasonal working capital needs currently planned business operations information technology enhancements capital expenditures acquisitions dividends stock repurchases restructuring initiatives commitments and other contractual obligations on both a nearterm and longterm basis 

the tcja resulted in the transition tax on unrepatriated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and changed the tax law in ways that present opportunities to repatriate cash without additional us federal income tax as a result we changed our indefinite reinvestment assertion related to certain foreign earnings and we continue to analyze the indefinite reinvestment assertion on our remaining applicable foreign earnings we do not believe that continuing to reinvest our foreign earnings impairs our ability to meet our domestic debt or working capital obligations if these reinvested earnings were repatriated into the united states as dividends we would be subject to state income taxes and applicable foreign taxes in certain jurisdictions 

the effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years however we are mindful of emerging inflationary pressures generally we have been able to introduce new products at higher prices increase prices and implement other operating efficiencies to sufficiently offset cost increases which have been moderate 

credit ratings 

changes in our credit ratings will likely result in changes in our borrowing costs our credit ratings also impact the cost of our revolving credit facility downgrades in our credit ratings may reduce our ability to issue commercial paper andor longterm debt and would likely increase the relative costs of borrowing a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating as of august 20 2021 our longterm debt is rated a with a stable outlook by standard  poor’s and a1 with a stable outlook by moody’s 

debt and access to liquidity 

total debt as a percent of total capitalization excluding noncontrolling interests decreased to 48 at june 30 2021 from 61 at june 30 2020 primarily due to the increase in total equity reflecting an increase in net earnings partially offset by a higher treasury stock balance also contributing to the decrease was a decrease in total debt primarily due to the fiscal 2021 repayments of the 750 million outstanding under our 1500 million revolving credit facility and the 450 million aggregate principal amount of our 170 senior notes due may 10 2021 partially offset by the march 2021 issuance of 600 million aggregate principal amount of our 1950 senior notes due march 15 2031 

for further information regarding our current and longterm debt and available financing see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 11 – debt  

cash flows 



the change in net cash flows from operations reflected higher earnings before taxes excluding noncash items as well as the improvement in working capital the improvement in working capital was primarily due to other accrued liabilities including an increase in accrued employee incentive compensation and the settlement of foreign currency forward contracts and accounts payable partially offset by the unfavorable change in accounts receivable due primarily to the increase in net sales 

the change in net cash flows used for investing activities primarily reflected the settlement of net investment hedges which is offset by the improvement in other accrued liabilities discussed above net cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 included cash paid net of cash acquired in connection with the acquisition of additional shares in deciem and the acquisition of have  be respectively 

the change in net cash flows from financing activities primarily reflected lower proceeds relating to the issuance of longterm debt the november 2019 and april 2020 issuances in fiscal 2020 compared to the march 2021 issuance in fiscal 2021 the fiscal 2021 repayment of borrowings under our revolving credit facility partially offset by lower treasury stock repurchases

pension and postretirement plan funding 

several factors influence the annual funding requirements for our pension plans for our domestic trustbased noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan “us qualified plan” we seek to maintain appropriate funded percentages for any future contributions to the us qualified plan we would seek to contribute an amount or amounts that would not be less than the minimum required by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended “erisa” and subsequent pension legislation and would not be more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes for each international plan our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations in addition amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions  the effect of our pension plan funding on future operating results will depend on economic conditions employee demographics mortality rates the number of participants electing to take lumpsum distributions investment performance and funding decisions 

for the us qualified plan we maintain an investment strategy of matching the duration of a substantial portion of the plan assets with the duration of the underlying plan liabilities this strategy assists us in maintaining our overall funded ratio for fiscal 2021 and 2020 we met or exceeded all contribution requirements under erisa regulations for the us qualified plan as we continue to monitor the funded status we may decide to make cash contributions to the us qualified plan or our postretirement medical plan in the united states during fiscal 2022 

the following table summarizes actual and expected benefit payments and contributions for our other pension and postretirement plans

credit risk

market risk 

we address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of market risk management that includes the use of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates and to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet to perform a sensitivity analysis of our foreign currency forward contracts we assess the change in fair values from the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates a hypothetical 10 weakening of the us dollar against the foreign exchange rates for the currencies in our portfolio would have resulted in a net decrease in the fair value of our portfolio of approximately 218 million and 222 million as of june 30 2021 and 2020 respectively this potential change does not consider our underlying foreign currency exposures 

in addition we enter into interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on our aggregate liability portfolio including future debt issuances based on a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates the estimated fair value of our interest rate derivatives would increase decrease by approximately 83 million and 9 million as of june 30 2021 and 2020 respectively 

our sensitivity analysis represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may or may not occur it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated based upon actual fluctuations in market rates operating exposures and the timing thereof and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year we believe however that any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the derivative financial instrument was intended 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not maintain any offbalance sheet arrangements transactions obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations 

recently issued accounting standards 

refer to item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 2 – summary of significant accounting policies for discussion regarding the impact of accounting standards that were recently issued but not yet effective on our consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition at june 30 2021 and our results of operations for the three fiscal years ended june 30 2021 are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements these estimates and assumptions can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates we consider accounting estimates to be critical if both i the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and ii the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to the company’s financial condition our critical accounting policies relate to goodwill other intangible assets and longlived assets  impairment assessment income taxes and business combinations 

management of the company has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of the company’s board of directors 

goodwill other intangible assets and longlived assets – impairment assessment 

goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets other indefinitelived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized 

when testing goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment we have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test if necessary we can perform a single step quantitative goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and record an impairment charge for the amount that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value up to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit for fiscal 2021 and 2020 we elected to perform the qualitative assessment for certain of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets this qualitative assessment included the review of certain macroeconomic factors and entityspecific qualitative factors to determine if it was morelikelythannot that the fair values of our reporting units were below carrying value for our other reporting units and other indefinitelived intangible assets a quantitative assessment was performed we engaged thirdparty valuation specialists and used industry accepted valuation models and criteria that were reviewed and approved by various levels of management 

for further discussion of the methods used and factors considered in our estimates as part of the impairment testing for goodwill other intangible assets and longlived assets see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 2 – summary of significant accounting policies  note 6 – goodwill and other intangible assets and note 7 – leases  

income taxes 

we calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate as the application of various tax laws relevant to our global business is often uncertain significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions the provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable for the current year the effect of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis net operating losses tax credit and other carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates when the assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled we regularly review deferred tax assets for realizability and establish valuation allowances based on available evidence including historical operating losses projected future taxable income expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and appropriate tax planning strategies if our assessment of the realizability of a deferred tax asset changes an increase to a valuation allowance will result in a reduction of net earnings at that time while the reduction of a valuation allowance will result in an increase of net earnings at that time 

we provide tax reserves for applicable us federal state local and foreign tax exposures relating to periods subject to audit the development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues potential outcomes and timing and is a subjective critical estimate we assess our tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting dates for those tax positions where it is morelikelythannot that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those tax positions where it is morelikelythannot that a tax benefit will not be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements we classify applicable interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes although the outcome relating to these exposures is uncertain in our opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating from these exposures if actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates they could have a material impact on our consolidated net earnings 

for further discussion of income taxes see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 2 – summary of significant accounting policies and note 9 – income taxes  

business combinations 

we use the acquisition method of accounting for acquired businesses under the acquisition method our consolidated financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the closing date of the acquisition we allocate the purchase price to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill the determination of fair value as well as the expected useful lives of certain assets acquired requires management to make judgements and may involve the use of significant estimates including assumptions with respect to estimated future cash flows discount rates and valuation multiples from comparable publicly traded companies among other things management estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 

during fiscal 2021 we increased our investment in deciem beauty group inc “deciem” on a fully diluted basis from approximately 29 to approximately 76 on a fully diluted basis the deciem employee stock options approximated 4 of the total capital structure and represent a liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of the acquisition date accordingly for purposes of determining the consideration transferred we excluded the deciem stock options which resulted in an increase in our postacquisition undiluted equity interest from approximately 30 to approximately 78 and the postacquisition undiluted equity interest of the remaining noncontrolling interest holders of approximately 22 we originally acquired a minority interest in deciem in june 2017 the original minority interest was accounted for as a cost method investment and in june 2020 we began to apply the equity method of accounting but we did not have to remeasure our investment in deciem since the passage of time does not constitute an observable price change the acquisition of the increased equity interest in deciem was considered a step acquisition whereby we remeasured the previously held equity method investment to its fair value resulting in the recognition of a noncash gain the acquisitiondate fair value of the previously held equity method investment was calculated by multiplying the grossup of the total consideration for the acquired ownership interest of 2988 million by the related effective previously held equity interest of approximately 305 the acquisitiondate fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest includes the acquisitiondate fair value of the net put call option of 234 million the remaining acquisitiondate fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest of 647 million was calculated by multiplying the grossup of the total consideration for the acquired ownership interest of 2988 million by the related noncontrolling interest of approximately 216 as part of the acquisition of additional shares deciem stock options were issued in replacement of and exchange for certain vested and unvested stock options previously issued by deciem the total fair value of the deciem stock options of 294 million was recorded as part of the total consideration transferred comp rising of 191 m illion of cash paid for vested options settled as of the acquisition date and 103 million reported as a stock options liability on the consolidated balance sheet as it is not an assumed liability of deciem and is expected to be settled in cash upon completion of the exercise of the put call the acquisitiondate fair value of the deciem stock options liability was calculated by multiplying the acquisitiondate fair value by the number of deciem stock options replaced the day after the acquisition date the stock options replaced consist of vested and partially vested stock options 

we recorded a preliminary allocation of the total consideration transferred to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair value at the acquisition date the total consideration transferred includes the cash paid at closing the fair value of its previously held equity method investment the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest  including the fair value of the net put call option and the fair value of the deciem stock options liability the excess of the total consideration transferred over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill

we have established a flexible global distribution network of logistic providers that are managed by us or third parties the network is designed to meet the changing demands of our customers while maintaining service levels we are continuously evaluating and adjusting this physical distribution network we have established regional and local distribution centers including those maintained by third parties strategically positioned throughout the world in order to facilitate efficient delivery of our products to our customers

the beauty business is highly competitive and if we are unable to compete effectively our results will suffer 

we face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world including multinational consumer product companies some competitors have greater resources than we do some others are newer companies some backed by privateequity investors and some are competing in distribution channels where we are less represented in some cases our competitors may be able to respond to changing business and economic conditions more quickly than us competition in the beauty business is based on a variety of factors including pricing of products innovation perceived value service to the consumer promotional activities advertising special events new product introductions ecommerce and mcommerce initiatives and other activities it is difficult for us to predict the timing and scale of our competitors’ actions in these areas 

our ability to compete also depends on the continued strength of our brands our ability to attract and retain key talent and other personnel the efficiency of our manufacturing facilities and distribution network and our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property and those other rights used in our business our company has a wellrecognized and strong reputation that could be negatively impacted by social media and many other factors if our reputation is adversely affected our ability to attract and retain customers and consumers could be impacted in addition certain of our key retailers around the world market and sell competing brands or are owned or otherwise affiliated with companies that market and sell competing brands our inability to continue to compete effectively in key countries around the world could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our inability to anticipate and respond to market trends and changes in consumer preferences could adversely affect our financial results 

our continued success depends on our ability to anticipate gauge and react in a timely and costeffective manner to changes in consumer tastes for skin care makeup fragrance and hair care products attitudes toward our industry and brands as well as to where and how consumers shop we must continually work to develop manufacture and market new products maintain and adapt our “hightouch” services to existing and emerging distribution channels maintain and enhance the recognition of our brands achieve a favorable mix of products successfully manage our inventories and modernize and refine our approach as to how and where we market and sell our products while we devote considerable effort and resources to shape analyze and respond to consumer preferences we recognize that consumer tastes cannot be predicted with certainty and can change rapidly the issue is compounded by the increasing use of digital and social media by consumers and the speed by which information and opinions are shared if we are unable to anticipate and respond to sudden challenges that we may face in the marketplace trends in the market for our products and changing consumer demands and sentiment our financial results will suffer in addition from time to time sales growth or profitability may be concentrated in a relatively small number of our brands channels or countries if such a situation persists or a number of brands channels or countries fail to perform as expected there could be a material adverse effect on our business 

in key markets such as the united states we have seen a decline in retail traffic in our department store customers and in our freestanding stores we continue to see the shift in consumer preference to the online channel which accelerated in response to covid19 consolidation or liquidation in the retail trade from these or other factors may result in us becoming increasingly dependent on key retailers and could result in an increased risk related to the concentration of our customers a severe adverse impact on the business operations of our customers could have a corresponding material adverse effect on us if one or more of our largest customers change their strategies including pricing or promotional activities enter bankruptcy or similar proceedings or if our relationship with any large customer is changed or terminated for any reason there could be a material adverse effect on our business 

our future success depends in part on our ability to achieve our longterm strategy 

achieving our longterm strategy will require investment in new capabilities brands categories distribution channels supply chain facilities technologies and emerging and more mature geographic markets these investments may result in shortterm costs without any current sales and therefore may be dilutive to our earnings in addition we may dispose of or discontinue select brands or streamline operations and incur costs or restructuring and other charges in doing so although we believe that our strategy will lead to longterm growth in sales and profitability we may not realize the anticipated benefits the failure to realize benefits which may be due to our inability to execute plans global or local economic conditions competition changes in the beauty industry and the other risks described herein could have a material adverse effect on our business 

acquisitions may expose us to additional risks 

we continuously review acquisition and strategic investment opportunities that would expand our current product offerings our distribution channels increase the size and geographic scope of our operations or otherwise offer growth and operating efficiency opportunities there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate these transactions on favorable terms if required the financing for these transactions could result in an increase in our indebtedness dilute the interests of our stockholders or both the purchase price for some acquisitions may include additional amounts to be paid in cash in the future a portion of which may be contingent on the achievement of certain future operating results of the acquired business if the performance of any such acquired business exceeds such operating results then we may incur additional charges and be required to pay additional amounts 

acquisitions including strategic investments or alliances entail numerous risks which may include 

• difficulties in integrating acquired operations or products including the loss of key employees from or customers of acquired businesses 

• diversion of management’s attention from our existing businesses 

• adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers 

• adverse impacts of margin and product cost structures different from those of our current mix of business and 

• risks of entering distribution channels categories or markets in which we have limited or no prior experience 

our failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business or to achieve the longterm plan for such business as well as any other adverse consequences associated with our acquisition and investment activities could have a material adverse effect on our business 

completed acquisitions typically result in additional goodwill andor an increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet we are required at least annually or as facts and circumstances exist to test goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to determine if impairment has occurred if the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives and the fair value of the goodwill or the fair value of other intangible assets with indefinite lives in the period the determination is made we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired there could be a material adverse effect on our business 

our business could be negatively impacted by corporate citizenship and sustainability matters 

there is an increased focus from certain investors customers consumers employees and other stakeholders concerning corporate citizenship and sustainability matters from time to time we announce certain initiatives including goals regarding our focus areas which include environmental matters packaging responsible sourcing social investments and inclusion and diversity we could fail or be perceived to fail in our achievement of such initiatives or goals or we could fail in accurately reporting our progress on such initiatives and goals such failures could be due to changes in our business eg shifts in business among distribution channels or acquisitions moreover the standards by which citizenship and sustainability efforts and related matters are measured are developing and evolving and certain areas are subject to assumptions the standards or assumptions could change over time in addition we could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or goals or perceived as not acting responsibly in connection with these matters any such matters or related corporate citizenship and sustainability matters could have a material adverse effect on our business 

a general economic downturn or sudden disruption in business conditions may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items andor the financial strength of our customers that are retailers which could adversely affect our financial results 

the general level of consumer spending is affected by a number of factors including general economic conditions inflation interest rates energy costs and consumer confidence generally all of which are beyond our control consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower and may impact sales of our products a decline in consumer purchases of discretionary items also tends to impact our customers that are retailers we generally extend credit to a retailer based on an evaluation of its financial condition usually without requiring collateral however the financial difficulties of a retailer could cause us to curtail or eliminate business with that customer we may also assume more credit risk relating to the receivables from that retailer our inability to collect receivables from our largest customers or from a group of customers could have a material adverse effect on our business if a retailer was to liquidate we may incur additional costs if we choose to purchase the retailer’s inventory of our products to protect brand equity 

in addition sudden disruptions in local or global business conditions for example from events such as a pandemic or other health issues geopolitical or local conflicts civil unrest terrorist attacks adverse weather conditions climate changes or seismic events can have a shortterm and sometimes longterm impact on consumer spending 

events that impact consumers’ willingness or ability to travel or purchase our products while traveling may impact our business including travel retail a significant contributor to our overall results and our strategy to market and sell products to international travelers at their destinations 

a downturn in the economies of or continuing recessions in the countries where we sell our products or a sudden disruption of business conditions in those countries could adversely affect consumer confidence the financial strength of our retailers and our sales and profitability we are also cautious of foreign currency movements including their impact on tourism additionally we continue to monitor the effects of the global macroeconomic environment social and political issues regulatory matters including the imposition of tariffs geopolitical tensions and global security issues 

volatility in the financial markets and a related economic downturn in key markets or markets generally throughout the world could have a material adverse effect on our business while we typically generate significant cash flows from our ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities credit markets may experience significant disruptions deterioration in global financial markets or an adverse change in our credit ratings could make future financing difficult or more expensive if any financial institutions that are parties to our revolving credit facility or other financing arrangements such as foreign exchange or interest rate hedging instruments were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us this could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain foreign currency or interest rate exposures which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic could materially adversely affect our financial results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and difficult to predict 

the outbreak and global spread of covid19 has significantly disrupted our operating environment including retail stores travel retail manufacturing distribution and the ability of many of our customers to operate we have also seen s hifts in consumer preferences and practices  

there is considerable uncertainty regarding this pandemic including measures being taken by various authorities and others to try to contain the pandemic as well as the timing of the identification and distribution of any vaccine or cure we are modifying our business practices including in response to legislation executive orders and guidance from government entities and healthcare authorities some of these changes to our business practices create operational challenges and may adversely impact our business as we continue to monitor covid19 developments including the impacts on our consumers customers and suppliers we have taken and will continue to take further measures some of the actions we take could adversely impact our business and there is no certainty that our actions will be sufficient to mitigate the risks and the impacts of covid19 

the pandemic has significantly increased economic uncertainty raising concerns about an economic slowdown and the possibility of a global recession history has not provided any comparable recent events that provide guidance concerning the impacts of a global pandemic like covid19 the degree to which covid19 impacts our business will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted many of which are outside our control including the identification and distribution of any vaccine or cure and to what extent there are sustainable improvements in the retail environment and general economic conditions 

changes in laws regulations and policies that affect our business could adversely affect our financial results 

our business is subject to numerous laws regulations and policies around the world changes in these laws regulations and policies including the interpretation or enforcement thereof that affect our business could adversely affect our financial results these changes include accounting standards laws and regulations relating to tax matters trade data privacy eg general data protection regulation gdpr anticorruption advertising marketing manufacturing distribution customs matters product registration ingredients chemicals packaging selective distribution environmental or climate change matters 

disputes and other legal or regulatory proceedings could adversely affect our financial results 

we are and may in the future become party to litigation other disputes or regulatory proceedings across a wide range of matters including ones relating to employment real estate environmental regulatory advertising trade relations tax privacy and product liability matters including asbestosrelated claims in general claims made by us or against us in litigation disputes or other proceedings can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements injunctions or damages that could significantly affect our business it is not possible to predict the final resolution of the litigation disputes or proceedings to which we currently are or may in the future become party to and the impact of certain of these matters on our business could be material  

government reviews inquiries investigations and actions could harm our business 

as we operate in various locations around the world our operations are subject to governmental scrutiny and may be adversely impacted by the results of such scrutiny the regulatory environment with regard to our business is evolving and officials often exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply applicable regulations from time to time we may receive formal and informal inquiries from various government regulatory authorities as well as selfregulatory organizations about our business and compliance with local laws regulations or standards any determination that our operations or activities or the activities of our employees are not in compliance with existing laws regulations or standards could negatively impact us in a number of ways including the imposition of substantial fines interruptions of business loss of supplier vendor or other thirdparty relationships termination of necessary licenses and permits or similar results all of which could potentially harm our business regardless of the outcomes these reviews inquiries investigations and actions could create negative publicity which could harm our business 

our success depends in part on the quality efficacy and safety of our products 

our success depends in part on the quality efficacy and safety of our products if our products are found to be defective or unsafe our product claims are found to be deceptive or our products otherwise fail to meet our consumers’ expectations our relationships with customers or consumers could suffer the appeal of one or more of our brands could be diminished and we could lose sales and become subject to liability or claims any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business in addition third parties may sell counterfeit versions of some of our products these counterfeit products may pose safety risks may fail to meet consumers’ expectations and may have a negative impact on our business 

our success depends in part on our key personnel 

our success depends in part on our ability to retain our key personnel including our executive officers and senior management team the unexpected loss of or misconduct by one or more of our key employees could adversely affect our business our success also depends in part on our continuing ability to identify hire train and retain other highly qualified personnel competition for these employees can be intense we may not be able to attract assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business this risk may be exacerbated by the stresses associated with the implementation of our strategic plan and other initiatives 

we are subject to risks related to the global scope of our operations 

we operate on a global basis with a majority of our fiscal 2020 net sales and operating income generated outside the united states we maintain offices in over 50 countries and have key operational facilities located inside and outside the united states that manufacture warehouse or distribute goods for sale throughout the world our global operations are subject to many risks and uncertainties including 

• fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and the relative costs of operating in different places which can affect our results of operations the value of our foreign assets the relative prices at which we and competitors sell products in the same markets the cost of certain inventory and noninventory items required in our operations and the relative prices at which we sell our products in different markets 

• foreign or us laws regulations and policies including restrictions on trade immigration and travel operations and investments currency exchange controls restrictions on imports and exports including license requirements tariffs and taxes 

• lack of wellestablished or reliable legal and administrative systems in certain countries in which we operate 

• adverse weather conditions and natural disasters and 

• social economic and geopolitical conditions such as a pandemic terrorist attack war or other military action 

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business 

a disruption in our operations or supply chain could adversely affect our business 

as a company engaged in manufacturing and distribution on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including industrial accidents environmental events strikes and other labor disputes capacity constraints disruptions in ingredient material or packaging supply as well as global shortages disruptions in supply chain or information technology loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites or suppliers product quality control safety increase in commodity prices and energy costs licensing requirements and other regulatory issues as well as natural disasters and other external factors over which we have no control if such an event were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we use a wide variety of direct and indirect suppliers of goods and services from around the world some of our products rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers could subject us to losses or adversely affect our ability to bring products to market further the failure of our suppliers to deliver goods and services in sufficient quantities in compliance with applicable standards and in a timely manner could adversely affect our customer service levels and overall business in addition any increases in the costs of goods and services for our business may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies in our operations 

our information technology and websites may be susceptible to cybersecurity breaches outages and other risks 

we rely on information technology outsourced and inhouse that support our business processes including product development marketing sales order processing production distribution finance and intracompany communications throughout the world we have ecommerce mcommerce and other internet websites in the united states and many other countries these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire floods power loss telecommunications failures breakins and other events despite the implementation of network security measures our systems may be vulnerable to constantly evolving cybersecurity threats such as malware breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering the occurrence of these or other events could disrupt or damage our information technology and adversely affect our business insurance policies that may provide coverage with regard to such events may not cover any or all of the resulting financial losses 

failure to adequately maintain the security of our electronic and other confidential information could materially adversely affect our business 

we are dependent upon automated information technology processes as part of our normal business activities we collect and store certain information that is confidential proprietary or otherwise sensitive including personal information with respect to customers consumers and employees we may share some of this information with vendors who assist us with certain aspects of our business moreover the success of our ecommerce and mcommerce operations depends upon the secure transmission of confidential and personal data over public networks including the use of cashless payments any failure on the part of us or our vendors to maintain the security of our confidential data and personal information including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information could result in business disruption damage to our reputation financial obligations to third parties fines penalties regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs and also result in deterioration in our employees’ consumers’ and customers’ confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition a security or data privacy breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to enhance our information security systems and could result in a disruption to our operations furthermore third parties including our suppliers and customers may also rely on information technology and be subject to such cybersecurity breaches these breaches may negatively impact their businesses which could in turn disrupt our supply chain andor our business 

we are subject to risks associated with our global information technology 

our implementation maintenance and utilization of global information technology outsourced inhouse and remote including operational technology supply chain and finance systems human resource management systems creative asset management and retail operating systems as well as associated hardware and use of cloudbased models involve risks and uncertainties failure to implement maintain or utilize these and other systems as planned in terms of timing specifications security policies costs or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business 

as we outsource functions we become more dependent on the entities performing those functions 

as part of our longterm strategy we are continually looking for opportunities to provide essential business services in a more costeffective manner in some cases this requires the outsourcing of functions or parts of functions that can be performed more effectively by external service providers these include certain information technology finance and human resource functions while we believe we conduct appropriate due diligence before entering into agreements with the outsourcing entity the failure of one or more entities to provide the expected services provide them on a timely basis or to provide them at the prices we expect may have a material adverse effect on our business in addition if we transition systems to one or more new or among existing external service providers we may experience challenges that could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the trading prices of our securities periodically may rise or fall based on the accuracy of predictions of our financial performance 

our business planning process is designed to maximize our longterm strength growth and profitability not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter we believe that this longerterm focus is in the best interests of the company and our stockholders at the same time however we recognize that it may be helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our expectations regarding certain aspects of our business this could include forecasts of net sales earnings per share and other financial metrics or projections we assume no responsibility to provide guidance or to update any guidance we provide and any longerterm guidance we may provide is based on goals that we believe at the time guidance is given are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years we historically have paid dividends on our common stock and repurchased shares of our class a common stock however at times we have suspended the declaration of dividends andor the repurchase of our class a common stock going forward at any time we could stop or suspend payment of dividends or stop or suspend our stock repurchase program and any such action could cause the market price of our stock to decline 

in all of our public statements when we make or update a forwardlooking statement about our business whether it be about net sales or earnings expectations or expectations regarding restructuring or other initiatives or otherwise we accompany such statements directly or by reference to a public document with a list of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we expect such a list is included among other places in our earnings press release and in our periodic filings with the sec eg in our reports on form 10k and form 10q these and other factors may make it difficult for us and for outside observers such as research analysts to predict what our earnings or other financial metrics or business outcomes will be in any given fiscal quarter or year 

outside analysts and investors have the right to make their own predictions of our business for any future period outside analysts however have access to no more material information about our results or plans than any other public investor and we do not endorse their predictions as to our future performance nor do we assume any responsibility to correct the predictions of outside analysts or others when they differ from our own internal expectations if and when we announce actual results that differ from those that outside analysts or others have been predicting the market price of our securities could be affected investors who rely on the predictions of outside analysts or others when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk we take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in the prices of our securities 

we are controlled by the lauder family as a result the lauder family has the ability to prevent or cause a change in control or approve prevent or influence certain actions by us 

as of august 20 2020 members of the lauder family beneficially own directly or indirectly shares of the company’s class a common stock with one vote per share and class b common stock with 10 votes per share having approximately 86 of the outstanding voting power of the common stock in addition there are four members of the lauder family who are company employees and members of our board of directors 

as a result of their stock ownership and positions at the company as well as our dualclass structure the lauder family has the ability to exercise significant control and influence over our business including all matters requiring stockholder approval eg the election of directors amendments to the certificate of incorporation and significant corporate transactions such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets for the foreseeable future in addition if significant stock indices decide to prohibit the inclusion of companies with dualclass stock structures the price of our class a common stock could be negatively impacted and could become more volatile 

we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the new york stock exchange rules and as a result are relying on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that are designed to provide protection to stockholders of companies that are not “controlled companies” 

the lauder family and their related entities own more than 50 of the total voting power of our common shares and as a result we are a “controlled company” under the new york stock exchange corporate governance standards as a controlled company we are exempt under the new york stock exchange standards from the obligation to comply with certain new york stock exchange corporate governance requirements including the requirements that 1 a majority of our board of directors consists of independent directors 2 we have a nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities and 3 we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities 

while we have voluntarily caused our board to have a majority of independent directors and the written charters of our nominating and governance committee and the compensation committee to have the required provisions we are not requiring our nominating and governance committee and compensation committee to be comprised solely of independent directors as a result of our use of the “controlled company” exemptions investors will not have the same protection afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the new york stock exchange corporate governance requirements

as part of the cost saving actions and cash conservation measures taken in response to the covid19 pandemic we did not declare quarterly cash dividends that would have been paid in june 2020 on august 19 2020 a dividend was declared in the amount of 48 per share on our class a and class b common stock the dividend is payable in cash on september 15 2020 to stockholders of record at the close of business on august 31 2020 we expect to continue the payment of cash dividends in the future but there can be no assurance that the board of directors will continue to declare them 

as of august 20 2020 there were 2380 record holders of class a common stock and 13 record holders of class b common stock

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

results of operations 

we manufacture market and sell beauty products including those in the skin care makeup fragrance and hair care categories which are distributed in approximately 150 countries and territories the following table is a comparative summary of operating results for fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 and reflects the basis of presentation described in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 2 – summary of significant accounting policies and note 22 – segment data and related information for all periods presented products and services that do not meet our definition of skin care makeup fragrance and hair care have been included in the “other” category 



1 the net sales and operating income from our travel retail business are included in the europe the middle east  africa region with the exception of the net sales of dr jart products in the travel retail channel that are reflected in korea in the asiapacific region 

during fiscal 2020 changes were made to reflect certain leading beauty forward enhancements made to the capabilities and cost structure of our travel retail business which are primarily centralized in the americas region and resulted in a change to the royalty structure of the travel retail business to reflect the value created in the americas region accordingly the fiscal 2019 and 2018 operating income of the americas was increased with a corresponding decrease in europe the middle east  africa by 866 million and 661 million respectively to conform with the current year methodology and presentation 

the following table presents certain consolidated earnings data as a percentage of net sales 



we continually introduce new products support new and established products through advertising merchandising and sampling and phase out existing products that no longer meet the needs of our consumers or our objectives the economics of developing producing launching supporting and discontinuing products impact our sales and operating performance each period the introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products which we take into account in our business planning 

nongaap financial measures 

we use certain nongaap financial measures among other financial measures to evaluate our operating performance which represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business management believes that excluding certain items that are not comparable from period to period helps investors and others compare operating performance between periods while we consider the nongaap measures useful in analyzing our results they are not intended to replace or act as a substitute for any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with us gaap see reconciliations of nongaap financial measures beginning on page 46 for reconciliations between nongaap financial measures and the most directly comparable us gaap measures 

we operate on a global basis with the majority of our net sales generated outside the united states accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our results of operations therefore we present certain net sales operating results and diluted net earnings per common share information excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations to provide a framework for assessing the performance of our underlying business outside the united states constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant periodoverperiod we calculate constant currency information by translating currentperiod results using prioryear period weightedaverage foreign currency exchange rates and adjusting for the periodoverperiod impact of foreign currency cash flow hedging activities 

overview 

covid19 business update 

we continue to monitor the impact of the covid19 pandemic which negatively impacted the second half of fiscal 2020 on all aspects of our business we have taken significant actions to help protect the health and safety of our employees beauty advisors and consumers as well as to effectively manage our business through the rapidly evolving disruptions in our operating environment we believe we are wellpositioned to participate in the markets recovery 

beginning in calendar 2020 governments in various countries implemented restrictions to prevent further spread of the virus these include the temporary closing of businesses deemed “nonessential” travel bans and restrictions social distancing and quarantines as a result we modified a number of our business practices in part due to legislation executive orders and guidance from government entities and healthcare authorities collectively “covid19 directives” 

retail impact 

brickandmortar retail stores that sell our products across most countries have experienced temporary or ongoing store closures and as they reopen significantly reduced consumer traffic this impacted the brickandmortar retail operations of our customers as well as our freestanding stores 

• in asiapacific nearly all retail stores have reopened after many stores closed for most of february 2020 through april 2020 

• in europe the middle east  africa retail stores began closing in early march 2020 and gradually reopened through june 2020 at the end of june 2020 approximately 15 of the stores remained closed and by midaugust most had reopened 

• in the americas retail stores began closing in midmarch 2020 by the end of june 2020 approximately 20 of the stores remained closed and by midaugust most stores had reopened 

• since midmarch 2020 air travel has been largely curtailed globally adversely impacting the annual growth trend of our travel retail business 

somewhat offsetting the significant declines in brickandmortar channels net sales growth of our products online through our own websites thirdparty platforms and websites of our retailers has accelerated globally 

as the pandemic continues we are continuing to assess local conditions and when counters and our stores should reopen 

due in large part to the challenging retail environment and with respect to the second half of fiscal 2020 uncertainties stemming from the covid19 pandemic we recognized goodwill other intangible asset and longlive asset impairments see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 6 – goodwill and other intangible assets and note 7 – leases for further information 

supply chain impact 

during the second half of fiscal 2020 a majority of our facilities continued to manufacture and distribute products globally albeit in a muchreduced capacity in light of safety measures designed to protect our employees in response to the covid19 pandemic by the end of our fiscal year all manufacturing and distribution facilities were operating with rapidly improving capacity we have to date been able to obtain raw materials and components at this time we expect to be able to produce and distribute our products when the demand increases our cost of sales was adversely impacted by the timing of expense recognition and other costs primarily caused by the covid19 pandemic including the shutdown of certain of our manufacturing facilities and the implementation of social distancing measures these adjustments resulted in an increase in cost of sales for the fiscal 2020 fourth quarter and fiscal 2020 of 80 million and 83 million respectively additionally we recorded an increase in excess and obsolete inventory which resulted in an increase in cost of sales for the fiscal 2020 fourth quarter and fiscal 2020 of 121 million and 166 million respectively 

cash conservation 

as the impacts from covid19 evolved we faced various uncertainties and implemented strict cost control measures and took actions to conserve cash such actions included 

• expense reductions including advertising and promotion activities travel meetings consulting and certain employee costs including implementing a hiring freeze furloughs and similar unpaid temporary leaves of absence for many point of sale employees temporary salary reductions for senior executives and other management employees and a temporary elimination of cash retainers for the board of directors combined these resulted in approximately 800 million of savings in the last five months of fiscal 2020 

• reduced capital investments eg facilities and consumerfacing counters by approximately 275 million for fiscal 2020 

• temporary suspension of discretionary repurchases of our class a common stock 

• not declaring a quarterly cash dividend that would have been paid in june 2020 

• raising an additional 2200 million of cash by issuing 700 million of senior unsecured notes and borrowed the full amount under our 1500 million revolving credit facility in june 2020 we repaid 750 million borrowed under our revolving credit facility and in august 2020 repaid the remaining 750 million 

government assistance 

during the second half of fiscal 2020 many governments in locations where we operate announced programs to assist employers whose businesses were impacted by the covid19 pandemic including programs that provide rebates to incentivize employers to maintain employees on payroll who were unable to work for their usual number of hours during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 we qualified for and recorded 99 million in government assistance which reduced selling general and administrative expenses and cost of sales by 87 million and 10 million respectively the remaining 2 million was deferred and will be recognized in fiscal 2021 we are continuing to review applicable government assistance programs globally 

we will continue to monitor the impacts of covid19 and adjust our action plans accordingly as the situation progresses 

business update 

our business is focused on prestige beauty which combines the repeat purchase and relative affordability of consumer goods with the highquality products and hightouch services of luxury goods at the same time we are well diversified by brand product category geography channel consumer segment and price point our innovation capabilities driven by our creativity and inspired by data analytics and consumer insights allow us to use our brand portfolio to capitalize on opportunities in fast growing and profitable areas of prestige beauty we believe that our broad and inclusive range of prestige product offerings allows us to increase our share of a consumer’s beauty routine and compete for consumers of prestige or mass brands 

• in fiscal 2020 global prestige skin care continued to lead product category growth our skin care net sales benefited from the enduring strength of hero product lines such as advanced night repair from estée lauder and crème de la mer from la mer as well as recent product launches the growth in asia and targeted expanded consumer reach the launches of advanced night repair intense reset concentrate and perfectionist rapid brightening treatment serum from estée lauder and the eye concentrate from la mer were particularly successful in asiapacific during fiscal 2020 our clinique brand introduced a new serum even better clinical dark spot corrector and interrupter which was successful in china net sales of skin care products rose in international markets led by estée lauder and incremental net sales of dr jart which we acquired in december 2019 

• global prestige makeup sales declined as covid19 limited social and business activities and consumers wore less makeup some subcategories in makeup performed better in the covid19 environment including eye products and makeup with skin care benefits such as tinted moisturizers while demand for lipstick and foundation weakened during fiscal 2020 our makeup net sales benefited from targeted expanded consumer reach and the continued success of existing products such as the double wear franchise and futurist line of products from estée lauder as well as the luminous lifting cushion foundation from la mer 

• our fragrance net sales declined as consumer demand shifted from personal fragrance to bath body and home the decline was offset by strong growth and targeted expanded consumer reach of le labo and certain new products such as poppy  barley from jo malone london and metallique from tom ford 

• our hair care net sales declined as covid19related salon and retail closures could not be offset by strong online acceleration during fiscal 2020 aveda launched the hydrating nutriplenish line of products which contributed positively 

our global distribution capability and operations allow us to focus on targeted expanded consumer reach wherever consumer demographics and trends are the most attractive our regional organizations and the expertise of our people there enable our brands to be more locally and culturally relevant in both product assortment and communications we are evolving the way we connect with our consumers in stores online and where they travel including by expanding our digital and social media presence and the engagement of global and local influencers to amplify brand or product stories we tailor our strategy by market to drive consumer engagement and embrace cultural diversity we continuously strengthen our presence in large imagebuilding core markets while broadening our presence in emerging markets 

• in north america we deployed a number of strategies to accelerate growth which began to deliver improvements through the first half of fiscal 2020 however the impact of covid19related store closures in the latter half further aggravated the challenging environment in brickandmortar retail despite the overall decline in net sales online net sales in north america grew double digits in latin america we continue to launch new brands expand social media outreach and encourage consumers to trade up from mass beauty products 

• in europe the middle east  africa we are expanding the consumer reach of many of our brands and strengthening their digital and social media presences 

• in asiapacific particularly in china we are leveraging our diversified brand portfolio and expansion on thirdparty online malls to benefit from the strong consumer demand for prestige beauty in mainland china net sales grew strong double digits reflecting growth in virtually all product categories as well as in nearly every brand and doubledigit growth in every channel led by online for fiscal 2020 over 40 of mainland chinas net sales was contributed by our online channels 

we approach distribution strategically by product category and location and seek to optimize distribution by matching our brands with appropriate opportunities while seeking to maintain high productivity per door we are expanding our brands in online and travel retail which we believe will be higher growth channels in the long term we also focus on brandbuilding retail activities technologydriven activations and omnichannel capabilities that enhance the shopping experience for consumers 

• as part of this strategy we have built a leadership position in the global travel retail channel that allowed us to leverage the increase in international passenger traffic before covid19 while covid19 has significantly curtailed international travel in the nearterm we continue to believe it is a growth opportunity for the longterm travel retail continues to be an important channel for brand building due to the increase in traveling consumers particularly those from emerging markets who often experience our brands for the first time while traveling we continue to expand our strategic presence in travel retail across dutyfree locations primarily in airports and downtown stores we engage consumers at the airport through compelling popup activations in nontraditional commercial areas and we ensure we have appropriate communication and curated assortments for targeted consumer groups at the same time travel retail is susceptible to a number of external factors including fluctuations in currency exchange rates and consumers’ willingness and ability to travel and spend 

• online net sales have accelerated strongly on a global basis reflecting strong double digit growth for fiscal 2020 as well as growth in all product categories and from nearly every brand we continue to enhance and launch e and mcommerce sites of our own in new and existing markets collaborate with our retail customers on their e and mcommerce sites and sell through select thirdparty online malls we believe our success in delivering particularly strong online growth is a result of adapting our strategy to meet local market and cultural needs we also continue to develop and implement omnichannel concepts virtual tryon tools and compelling content to deliver an integrated consumer experience and better serve consumers as they shop across channels 

our multiple engines of growth which have historically enabled us to produce excellent net sales growth are also helping to mitigate the impact of the declines caused by covid19 we also benefited from the transformation of certain operations that freed up resources to invest behind further growth opportunities our leading beauty forward initiative described below enabled us to reduce costs and invest in new capabilities such as digital marketing and data analytics as well as increased advertising 

in fiscal 2020 we continued to further integrate corporate citizenship and sustainability into our strategy and business operations areas of focus include packaging ingredient transparency responsible sourcing energy and emissions waste and water social investments and employee engagement and safety 

outlook 

there are no comparable recent events that provide guidance concerning the impacts of a global pandemic like covid19 due to the uncertainty of its duration and severity at this time we are not able to reliably estimate to the same degree as prior to covid19 the extent of the future adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations for fiscal 2021 the degree to which covid19 and its collateral effects impact our business the results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including how quickly and to what extent there are sustainable improvements in the retail environment and general economic conditions as we continue to monitor covid19 developments including the impacts on our consumers customers and suppliers we may adjust prior actions and take further actions however there is no certainty that the actions we take will be sufficient to mitigate the risks and impacts from covid19 

we believe that the best way to increase longterm stockholder value is to continue providing superior products and services in the most efficient and effective manner while recognizing shifts in consumers’ behaviors and shopping practices accordingly our longterm strategy has numerous initiatives across geographic regions product categories brands channels of distribution and functions designed to grow our sales provide cost efficiencies leverage our strengths and make us more productive and profitable we plan to build upon and leverage our history of outstanding creativity and innovation high quality products and services and engaging communications while investing for longterm sustainable growth 

while we continue to face strong competition and economic challenges globally covid19 has caused a more significant disruption to our business and the retail industry generally we are seeing and believe there will be more impairments restructurings and bankruptcies in the retail industry including among our customers destocking and tighter working capital management by retailers challenges for suppliers and an acceleration in the shifts in consumer preferences as to where and how they shop as well as changes in their preferences for certain products the severe decline in international travel is also causing a significant decline in our travel retail business which had been historically one of our most profitable channels in addition to impacting net sales and profitability these and other challenges may impact our ability to collect receivables and our operating cash flows generally and may adversely impact the goodwill other intangibles and longlived assets associated with our acquired brands we continue to monitor the geopolitical tensions between the united states and china and the uncertainties caused by the evolving trade policy dispute which could increase our cost of sales and negatively impact our overall net sales or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business we also continue to monitor the potential implications of the ongoing economic and political uncertainties stemming from the united kingdom’s exit and transition from the european union ie “brexit” and continue developing our risk mitigation strategies to address such uncertainties these strategies include changes related to regulatory and legislative compliance assessing alternatives to supply chain routing revising customer arrangements and analyzing inventory levels 

we are also cautious of foreign currency movements including their impacts on tourism dynamics that have already been adversely affected by covid19 and covid19 directives additionally we continue to monitor the effects of the global macroeconomic environment social and political issues regulatory matters including the imposition of tariffs geopolitical tensions and global security issues 

covid19 is proving to be the most significant challenge we have faced as a public company the uncertainty around the timing speed and duration of the recovery from the adverse impacts will continue to affect our ability to grow sales profitably we believe we can to some extent offset the impact of more ordinary challenges by continually developing and pursuing a diversified strategy with multiple engines of growth and by accelerating initiatives focused on areas of strength discipline and agility as the current situation progresses if economic and social conditions or the degree of uncertainty or volatility worsen or the adverse conditions previously described are further prolonged there could be a further negative effect on consumer confidence demand spending and willingness or ability to travel and as a result on our business we are continuing to monitor these and other risks that may affect our business 

leading beauty forward 

in may 2016 we announced a multiyear initiative “leading beauty forward” or the “lbf program” to build on our strengths and better leverage our cost structure to free resources for investment to continue our growth momentum leading beauty forward is designed to enhance our gotomarket capabilities reinforce our leadership in global prestige beauty and continue creating sustainable value as of june 30 2019 we concluded the approvals of all major initiatives under leading beauty forward related to the optimization of select corporate functions supply chain activities and corporate and regional market support structures as well as the exit of underperforming businesses and expect to substantially complete those initiatives through fiscal 2021 for additional information about restructuring and other charges see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 8 – charges associated with restructuring and other activities  

postcovid business acceleration program 

on august 20 2020 we announced a twoyear restructuring program postcovid business acceleration program the “restructuring program” designed to resize our business against the dramatic shifts to our distribution landscape and consumer behaviors in the wake of the covid19 pandemic the restructuring program will help improve efficiency and effectiveness by rebalancing resources to growth areas of prestige beauty it will further strengthen us by building upon the foundational capabilities in which we have invested 

the restructuring program’s main areas of focus include accelerating the shift to online with the realignment of our distribution network reflecting freestanding store and certain department store closures with a focus on north america and europe the middle east  africa the reduction in brickandmortar point of sale employees and related support staff and the redesign of our regional branded marketing organizations plus select opportunities in global brands and functions we committed to this course of action on august 18 2020 this program is expected to position us to better execute our longterm strategy while strengthening our financial flexibility 

in connection with the restructuring program at this time we estimate a net reduction in the range of approximately 1500 to 2000 positions globally which is about 3 of our current workforce including temporary and parttime employees this reduction takes into account the elimination of some positions retraining and redeployment of certain employees and investment in new positions in key areas we also estimate the closure of approximately 10 to 15 of our freestanding stores globally 

we plan to approve specific initiatives under the restructuring program through fiscal 2022 and expect to complete those initiatives through fiscal 2023 we expect that the restructuring program will result in related restructuring and other charges totaling between 400 million and 500 million before taxes consisting of employeerelated costs contract terminations asset writeoffs and other costs to implement these initiatives 

once fully implemented we expect the restructuring program to yield annual benefits primarily in selling general and administrative expenses of between 300 million and 400 million before taxes we expect to reinvest a portion behind future growth initiatives 

impairment testing 

we assess goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets at least annually for impairment or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist 

during december 2019 given the continuing declines in prestige makeup generally in north america and the ongoing competitive activity our too faced becca and smashbox reporting units made revisions to their internal forecasts concurrent with our brand strategy review process during march 2020 given the actual and the estimate of the potential future impacts relating to the uncertainty of the duration and severity of covid19 impacting us we made additional revisions to the internal forecasts relating to our too faced becca smashbox and glamglow reporting units we concluded that the changes in circumstances in these reporting units triggered the need for an interim impairment review of their respective trademarks and goodwill these changes in circumstances were also an indicator that the carrying amounts of their respective longlived assets including customer lists may not be recoverable accordingly we performed interim impairment tests for the trademarks and recoverability tests for the longlived assets as of december 31 2019 and march 31 2020 we concluded that the carrying amounts of the longlived assets were recoverable for december 31 2019 and march 31 2020 we also concluded that the carrying values of the trademarks exceeded their estimated fair values and recorded impairment charges for december 31 2019 we utilized the relieffromroyalty method to determine discounted projected future cash flows and for march 31 2020 the relieffromroyalty method was based on probability weighted cash flows after adjusting the carrying values of the trademarks we completed interim quantitative impairment tests for goodwill and recorded goodwill impairment charges for each of these reporting units for december 31 2019 the fair value of each reporting unit was based upon an equal weighting of the income and market approaches utilizing estimated cash flows and a terminal value discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows as well as valuation multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies that are applied to operating performance of the reporting unit for march 31 2020 the fair value of each reporting unit was based upon an equal weighting of the income and market approaches utilizing estimated cash flows based on probability weighted undiscounted cash flows and a terminal value discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows as well as valuation multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies that are applied to operating performance of the reporting unit 

based on our annual goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible asset impairment testing as of april 1 2020 we determined that the carrying value of the editions de parfums frédéric malle reporting unit exceeded its fair value this determination was made based on updated internal forecasts finalized and approved in june 2020 that reflected lower net sales growth projections due to a softer than expected retail environment for the brand as well as the impacts relating to the uncertainty of the duration and severity of covid19 these changes in circumstances were also an indicator that the carrying amounts of its respective longlived assets including customer lists may not be recoverable we concluded that the carrying value of the trademarks exceeded its estimated fair value which was determined utilizing the relieffromroyalty method to determine discounted projected future cash flows and recorded impairment charges we concluded that the carrying amounts of the longlived assets were recoverable after adjusting the carrying value of the trademarks we completed the quantitative impairment test for goodwill and recorded a goodwill impairment charge for this reporting unit the fair value of this reporting unit was based upon an equal weighting of the income and market approaches utilizing estimated cash flows and a terminal value discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows as well as valuation multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies that are applied to operating performance of the reporting unit 

during june 2020 given the actual and the estimate of the potential future impacts relating to the uncertainty of the duration and severity of covid19 impacting us we made further revisions to the internal forecasts relating to our becca and glamglow reporting units we concluded that the changes in circumstances in these reporting units triggered the need for an interim impairment review of their respective trademarks and goodwill these changes in circumstances were also an indicator that the carrying amounts of their respective longlived assets including customer lists may not be recoverable accordingly we performed interim impairment tests for the trademarks and recoverability tests for the longlived assets as of june 30 2020 we concluded that the carrying values of the trademarks for becca and glamglow exceeded their estimated fair values which were determined utilizing the relieffromroyalty method to determine discounted projected future cash flows and recorded impairment charges in addition we concluded that the carrying value of the becca customer lists intangible asset exceeded its estimated fair value which was determined utilizing the multiperiod excess earnings income approach by discounting the incremental aftertax cash flows over multiple periods and recorded an impairment charge we concluded that the carrying amounts of the longlived assets of glamglow were recoverable after adjusting the carrying values of the trademarks and the becca customer lists we completed interim quantitative impairment tests for goodwill and recorded goodwill impairment charges for each of these reporting units the fair value of each reporting unit was based upon an equal weighting of the income and market approaches utilizing estimated cash flows and a terminal value discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows as well as valuation multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies that are applied to operating performance of the reporting unit 

a summary of the impairment charges for the three and twelve months ended june 30 2020 and the remaining trademark customer lists and goodwill carrying values as of june 30 2020 for each reporting unit are as follows 



the impairment charges for the three and twelve months ended june 30 2020 were reflected in the americas region 

with the exception of the editions de parfums frédéric malle becca and glamglow reporting units fair values of all reporting units which were primarily determined based on qualitative assessments with material goodwill were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values 

the fair values of the editions de parfums frédéric malle becca and glamglow trademarks were equal to their carrying values subsequent to the impairments charges taken as of june 30 2020 and the fair values of the too faced and smashbox trademarks exceeded their carrying values by approximately 7 and 16 respectively as of june 30 2020 the carrying values of the too faced and smashbox trademarks were 272 million and 32 million respectively the key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of the reporting units are primarily predicated on the estimated future impacts of covid19 the success of future new product launches the achievement of distribution expansion plans and the realization of cost reduction and other efficiency efforts if such plans do not materialize or if there are further challenges in the business environments in which these reporting units operate resulting changes in the key assumptions could have negative impacts on the estimated fair values of the reporting units and it is possible we could recognize additional impairment charges in the future

financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program borrowings from the issuance of longterm debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks and other lenders in the united states and abroad at june 30 2020 we had cash and cash equivalents of 5022 million compared with 2987 million at june 30 2019 in response to the initial global uncertainty attributable to the covid19 pandemic we issued 700 million of senior notes in april 2020 and borrowed the full amount under our 1500 million revolving credit facility in march and april 2020 by the end of june 2020 we had repaid 750 million under the revolving credit facility and subsequently repaid the remaining 750 million in august 2020 overall these actions were designed to further enhance our financial flexibility and liquidity our cash and cash equivalents are maintained at a number of financial institutions to mitigate the risk of uninsured balances we select financial institutions based on their credit ratings and financial strength and we perform ongoing evaluations of these institutions to limit our concentration risk exposure 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that cash on hand cash generated from operations available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support seasonal working capital needs currently planned business operations information technology enhancements capital expenditures acquisitions dividends stock repurchases restructuring initiatives commitments and other contractual obligations on both a nearterm and longterm basis see overview – covid19 business update for actions taken by us in response to the impact of covid19 on our business which helped to mitigate the then expected loss of sales and uncertainties regarding account receivables and to conserve cash 

the tcja which was enacted during our fiscal 2018 resulted in the transition tax on unrepatriated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and changed the tax law in ways that present opportunities to repatriate cash without additional us federal income tax as a result we changed our indefinite reinvestment assertion related to certain foreign earnings and we continue to analyze the indefinite reinvestment assertion on our remaining applicable foreign earnings the issuance of guidance subsequent to the enactment of the tcja has enabled us to access a substantial portion of the cash in offshore jurisdictions associated with our permanently reinvested earnings without significant cost we do not believe that continuing to reinvest our foreign earnings impairs our ability to meet our domestic debt or working capital obligations if these reinvested earnings were repatriated into the united states as dividends we would be subject to state income taxes and applicable foreign taxes in certain jurisdictions 

the effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years generally we have been able to introduce new products at higher prices increase prices and implement other operating efficiencies to sufficiently offset cost increases which have been moderate

changes in our credit ratings will likely result in changes in our borrowing costs our credit ratings also impact the cost of our revolving credit facility downgrades in our credit ratings may reduce our ability to issue commercial paper andor longterm debt and would likely increase the relative costs of borrowing a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating as of august 20 2020 our longterm debt is rated a with a negative outlook by standard  poor’s and a1 with a stable outlook by moody’s 

debt and access to liquidity 

total debt as a percent of total capitalization excluding noncontrolling interests increased to 61 at june 30 2020 from 44 at june 30 2019 primarily due to the november 2019 issuance of the 2000 senior notes due december 1 2024 “2024 senior notes” 2375 senior notes due december 1 2029 “2029 senior notes” and 3125 senior notes due december 1 2049 “2049 senior notes” the april 2020 issuance of the 2600 senior notes due april 15 2030 “2030 senior notes” and the 750 million outstanding under our 1500 million revolving credit facility at june 30 2020 also contributing to the increase was the decrease in total equity reflecting a decrease in net earnings partially offset by lower treasury stock purchases 

for further information regarding our current and longterm debt and available financing see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 11 – debt  

cash flows 



the change in net cash flows from operations primarily reflected lower net sales partially offset by the cost actions taken in response to covid19 the lower net sales also reduced working capital needs 

the change in net cash flows from investing activities primarily reflected cash paid net of cash acquired in connection with the fiscal 2020 second quarter acquisition of have  be as well as lower proceeds from the sale of investments due to the prioryear liquidation of our foreign subsidiary that owned our availableforsale securities 

the change in net cash flows from financing activities primarily reflected proceeds from the november 2019 and april 2020 issuance of longterm debt changes in shortterm debt reflecting current borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility and the issuance of commercial paper and lower treasury stock purchases partially offset by the repayment of the 2020 senior notes in the current year

dividends

pension and postretirement plan funding 

several factors influence the annual funding requirements for our pension plans for our domestic trustbased noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan “us qualified plan” we seek to maintain appropriate funded percentages for any future contributions to the us qualified plan we would seek to contribute an amount or amounts that would not be less than the minimum required by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended “erisa” and subsequent pension legislation and would not be more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes for each international plan our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations in addition amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions  the effect of our pension plan funding on future operating results will depend on economic conditions employee demographics mortality rates the number of participants electing to take lumpsum distributions investment performance and funding decisions 

for the us qualified plan we maintain an investment strategy of matching the duration of a substantial portion of the plan assets with the duration of the underlying plan liabilities this strategy assists us in maintaining our overall funded ratio for fiscal 2020 and 2019 we met or exceeded all contribution requirements under erisa regulations for the us qualified plan as we continue to monitor the funded status we may decide to make cash contributions to the us qualified plan or our postretirement medical plan in the united states during fiscal 2021 

the following table summarizes actual and expected benefit payments and contributions for our other pension and postretirement plans 



commitments and contingencies 

certain of our business acquisition agreements include contingent consideration or “earnout” provisions these provisions generally require that we pay to the seller or sellers of the business additional amounts based on the performance of the acquired business since the size of each payment depends upon performance of the acquired business we do not expect that such payments will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or financial condition 

for additional contingencies refer to item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 16 – commitments and contingencies contractual obligations

market risk 

we address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of market risk management that includes the use of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates and to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet to perform a sensitivity analysis of our foreign currency forward contracts we assess the change in fair values from the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates a hypothetical 10 weakening of the us dollar against the foreign exchange rates for the currencies in our portfolio would have resulted in a net increase decrease in the fair value of our portfolio of approximately 222 million and 48 million as of june 30 2020 and 2019 respectively this potential change does not consider our underlying foreign currency exposures 

in addition we enter into interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on our aggregate liability portfolio including future debt issuances based on a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates the estimated fair value of our interest rate derivatives would increase decrease by approximately 9 million and 16 million as of june 30 2020 and 2019 respectively our sensitivity analysis represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may or may not occur it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated based upon actual fluctuations in market rates operating exposures and the timing thereof and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year we believe however that any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the derivative financial instrument was intended 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not maintain any offbalance sheet arrangements transactions obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations 

recently issued accounting standards 

refer to item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 2 – summary of significant accounting policies for discussion regarding the impact of accounting standards that were recently issued but not yet effective on our consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition at june 30 2020 and our results of operations for the three fiscal years ended june 30 2020 are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements these estimates and assumptions can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates we consider accounting estimates to be critical if both i the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and ii the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to the company’s financial condition our critical accounting policies relate to goodwill other intangible assets and longlived assets income taxes and business combinations 

management of the company has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of the company’s board of directors 

goodwill other intangible assets and longlived assets – impairment assessment 

goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets other indefinitelived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized 

when testing goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment we have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test if necessary we can perform a single step quantitative goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and record an impairment charge for the amount that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value up to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit for fiscal 2020 and 2019 we elected to perform the qualitative assessment for certain of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets this qualitative assessment included the review of certain macroeconomic factors and entityspecific qualitative factors to determine if it was morelikelythannot that the fair values of our reporting units were below carrying value for our other reporting units and other indefinitelived intangible assets a quantitative assessment was performed we engaged thirdparty valuation specialists and used industry accepted valuation models and criteria that were reviewed and approved by various levels of management 

for further discussion of the methods used and factors considered in our estimates as part of the impairment testing for goodwill other intangible assets and longlived assets see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 2 – summary of significant accounting policies  note 6 – goodwill and other intangible assets and note 7 – leases  

income taxes 

we calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate as the application of various tax laws relevant to our global business is often uncertain significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions the provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable for the current year the effect of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis net operating losses tax credit and other carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates when the assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled we regularly review deferred tax assets for realizability and establish valuation allowances based on available evidence including historical operating losses projected future taxable income expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and appropriate tax planning strategies if our assessment of the realizability of a deferred tax asset changes an increase to a valuation allowance will result in a reduction of net earnings at that time while the reduction of a valuation allowance will result in an increase of net earnings at that time 

we provide tax reserves for us federal state local and foreign tax exposures relating to periods subject to audit the development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues potential outcomes and timing and is a subjective critical estimate we assess our tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting dates for those tax positions where it is morelikelythannot that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those tax positions where it is morelikelythannot that a tax benefit will not be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements we classify applicable interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes although the outcome relating to these exposures is uncertain in our opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating from these exposures if actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates they could have a material impact on our consolidated net earnings 

for further discussion of our income taxes accounting policy see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 2 – summary of significant accounting policies  

business combinations 

we use the acquisition method of accounting for acquired businesses under the acquisition method our consolidated financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the closing date of the acquisition we allocate the purchase price to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill the determination of fair value as well as the expected useful lives of certain assets acquired requires management to make judgements and may involve the use of significant estimates including assumptions with respect to estimated future cash flows discount rates and valuation multiples from comparable publicly traded companies among other things management estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 

during fiscal 2020 we acquired the remaining 6666 equity interest in have  be we originally acquired a minority interest in have  be in december 2015 and that investment structure included a formulabased call option for the remaining equity interest the original minority interest was accounted for as an equity method investment the acquisition of the remaining equity interest in have  be was considered a step acquisition whereby we remeasured the previously held equity method investment to its fair value resulting in the recognition of a gain the acquisition of the remaining equity interest also resulted in the recognition of a previously unrealized foreign currency gain which was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income the fair value of the previously held equity method investment was determined based upon a valuation of the acquired business as of the date of acquisition using an equal weighting of the income and market approaches utilizing estimated cash flows and a terminal value discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows as well as valuation multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies 

we allocated the total consideration transferred which included the cash paid at closing and the fair value of our previously held equity method investment to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair value at the acquisition date the excess of the total consideration transferred over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill

our results of operations in total by region and by product category are subject to seasonal fluctuations with net sales in the first half of the fiscal year typically being slightly higher than in the second half of the fiscal year the higher net sales in the first half of the fiscal year are attributable to the increased levels of purchasing by retailers for the holiday selling season fluctuations in net sales and operating income in total and by geographic region and product category in any fiscal quarter may be attributable to the level and scope of new product introductions or the particular retail calendars followed by our customers that are retailers which may impact their order placement and receipt of goods additionally gross margins and operating expenses are impacted on a quarterbyquarter basis by variations in our launch calendar and the timing of promotions including purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions

 item 1a risk factors 

  

there are risks associated with an investment in our securities please consider the following risks and all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k and in our subsequent filings with the securities and exchange commission “sec” our business may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial if any of the events contemplated by the following discussion of risks should occur or other risks arise or develop our business which includes our prospects financial condition and results of operations the trading prices of our securities and our reputation may be adversely affected 

  

the beauty business is highly competitive and if we are unable to compete effectively our results will suffer 

  

we face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world including multinational consumer product companies some of these competitors have greater resources than we do and others are newer companies some backed by privateequity investors competing in distribution channels where we are less represented in some cases our competitors may be able to respond to changing business and economic conditions more quickly than us competition in the beauty business is based on a variety of factors including pricing of products innovation perceived value service to the consumer promotional activities advertising special events new product introductions ecommerce and mcommerce initiatives and other activities it is difficult for us to predict the timing and scale of our competitors’ actions in these areas 

  

our ability to compete also depends on the continued strength of our brands our ability to attract and retain key talent and other personnel the efficiency of our manufacturing facilities and distribution network and our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property and those other rights used in our business our company has a wellrecognized and strong reputation that could be negatively impacted by social media and many other factors if our reputation is adversely affected our ability to attract and retain customers and consumers could be impacted in addition certain of our key retailers around the world market and sell competing brands or are owned or otherwise affiliated with companies that market and sell competing brands our inability to continue to compete effectively in key countries around the world could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

our inability to anticipate and respond to market trends and changes in consumer preferences could adversely affect our financial results 

  

our continued success depends on our ability to anticipate gauge and react in a timely and costeffective manner to changes in consumer tastes for skin care makeup fragrance and hair care products attitudes toward our industry and brands as well as to where and how consumers shop we must continually work to develop manufacture and market new products maintain and adapt our “hightouch” services to existing and emerging distribution channels maintain and enhance the recognition of our brands achieve a favorable mix of products successfully manage our inventories and modernize and refine our approach as to how and where we market and sell our products while we devote considerable effort and resources to shape analyze and respond to consumer preferences we recognize that consumer tastes cannot be predicted with certainty and can change rapidly the issue is compounded by the increasing use of digital and social media by consumers and the speed by which information and opinions are shared if we are unable to anticipate and respond to sudden challenges that we may face in the marketplace trends in the market for our products and changing consumer demands and sentiment our financial results will suffer in addition from time to time sales growth or profitability may be concentrated in a relatively small number of our brands channels or countries if such a situation persists or a number of brands channels or countries fail to perform as expected there could be a material adverse effect on our business 

  

in key markets such as the united states we have seen a decline in retail traffic in some of our department store customers and certain of our freestanding stores we are seeing the emergence of strong e and mcommerce platforms both in mass and prestige distribution that are impacting our business consolidation or liquidation in the retail trade from these or other factors may result in us becoming increasingly dependent on key retailers and could result in an increased risk related to the concentration of our customers a severe adverse impact on the business operations of our customers could have a corresponding material adverse effect on us if one or more of our largest customers change their strategies including pricing or promotional activities or if our relationship with any large customer is changed or terminated for any reason there could be a material adverse effect on our business 

  

our future success depends in part on our ability to achieve our longterm strategy 

  

achieving our longterm strategy will require investment in new capabilities brands categories distribution channels supply chain facilities technologies and emerging and more mature geographic markets these investments may result in shortterm costs without any current sales and therefore may be dilutive to our earnings in addition we may dispose of or discontinue select brands or streamline operations and incur costs or restructuring and other charges in doing so although we believe that our strategy will lead to longterm growth in sales and profitability we may not realize the anticipated benefits the failure to realize benefits which may be due to our inability to execute plans global or local economic conditions competition changes in the beauty industry and the other risks described herein could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

  

acquisitions may expose us to additional risks 

  

we continuously review acquisition and strategic investment opportunities that would expand our current product offerings our distribution channels increase the size and geographic scope of our operations or otherwise offer growth and operating efficiency opportunities there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate these transactions on favorable terms if required the financing for these transactions could result in an increase in our indebtedness dilute the interests of our stockholders or both the purchase price for some acquisitions may include additional amounts to be paid in cash in the future a portion of which may be contingent on the achievement of certain future operating results of the acquired business if the performance of any such acquired business exceeds such operating results then we may incur additional charges and be required to pay additional amounts 

  

acquisitions including strategic investments or alliances entail numerous risks which may include 

  

·   difficulties in integrating acquired operations or products including the loss of key employees from or customers of acquired businesses

  

·   diversion of management ’ s attention from our existing businesses

  

·   adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers

  

·   adverse impacts of margin and product cost structures different from those of our current mix of business and

  

·   risks of entering distribution channels categories or markets in which we have limited or no prior experience

  

our failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business or to achieve the longterm plan for such business as well as any other adverse consequences associated with our acquisition and investment activities could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

completed acquisitions typically result in additional goodwill andor an increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet we are required at least annually or as facts and circumstances exist to test goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to determine if impairment has occurred if the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the fair value of other intangible assets with indefinite lives in the period the determination is made we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired there could be a material adverse effect on our business 

  

our business could be negatively impacted by corporate citizenship and sustainability matters 

  

there is an increased focus from certain investors customers consumers employees and other stakeholders concerning corporate citizenship and sustainability matters from time to time we announce certain initiatives including goals regarding our focus areas which include environmental matters packaging responsible sourcing and social investments we could fail or be perceived to fail in our achievement of such initiatives or goals or we could fail in accurately reporting our progress on such initiatives and goals in addition we could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or goals or perceived as not acting responsibly in connection with these matters our business could be negatively impacted by the matters discussed above any such matters or related corporate citizenship and sustainability matters could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

a general economic downturn or sudden disruption in business conditions may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items andor the financial strength of our customers that are retailers which could adversely affect our financial results 

  

the general level of consumer spending is affected by a number of factors including general economic conditions inflation interest rates energy costs and consumer confidence generally all of which are beyond our control consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower and may impact sales of our products a decline in consumer purchases of discretionary items also tends to impact our customers that are retailers we generally extend credit to a retailer based on an evaluation of its financial condition usually without requiring collateral however the financial difficulties of a retailer could cause us to curtail or eliminate business with that customer we may also assume more credit risk relating to the receivables from that retailer our inability to collect receivables from our largest customers or from a group of customers could have a material adverse effect on our business if a retailer was to liquidate we may incur additional costs if we choose to purchase the retailer’s inventory of our products to protect brand equity 

  

in addition sudden disruptions in business conditions for example from events such as a pandemic or other local or global health issues conflicts around the world or as a result of a terrorist attack retaliation or similar threats or as a result of adverse weather conditions climate changes or seismic events can have a shortterm and sometimes longterm impact on consumer spending 

  

events that impact consumers’ willingness or ability to travel or purchase our products while traveling may impact our business including travel retail a significant contributor to our overall results and our strategy to market and sell products to international travelers at their destinations 

  

  

a downturn in the economies of or continuing recessions in the countries where we sell our products or a sudden disruption of business conditions in those countries could adversely affect consumer confidence the financial strength of our retailers and our sales and profitability we are also cautious of foreign currency movements including their impact on tourism additionally we continue to monitor the effects of the global macroeconomic environment social and political issues regulatory matters including the imposition of tariffs geopolitical tensions and global security issues 

  

volatility in the financial markets and a related economic downturn in key markets or markets generally throughout the world could have a material adverse effect on our business while we currently generate significant cash flows from our ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities credit markets may experience significant disruptions deterioration in global financial markets or an adverse change in our credit ratings could make future financing difficult or more expensive if any financial institutions that are parties to our undrawn revolving credit facility or other financing arrangements such as foreign exchange or interest rate hedging instruments were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us this could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain foreign currency or interest rate exposures which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

changes in laws regulations and policies that affect our business could adversely affect our financial results 

  

our business is subject to numerous laws regulations and policies around the world changes in these laws regulations and policies including the interpretation or enforcement thereof that affect our business could adversely affect our financial results these changes include accounting standards laws and regulations relating to tax matters trade data privacy eg general data protection regulation gdpr anticorruption advertising marketing manufacturing distribution customs matters product registration ingredients chemicals packaging selective distribution environmental or climate change matters 

  

we are involved and may become involved in the future in disputes and other legal or regulatory proceedings that could adversely affect our financial results 

  

we are and may in the future become party to litigation other disputes or regulatory proceedings in general claims made by us or against us in litigation disputes or other proceedings can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements injunctions or damages that could significantly affect our business we are currently vigorously contesting certain of these claims however it is not possible to predict the final resolution of the litigation disputes or proceedings to which we currently are or may in the future become party to and the impact of certain of these matters on our business could be material 

  

government reviews inquiries investigations and actions could harm our business 

  

as we operate in various locations around the world our operations in certain countries are subject to significant governmental scrutiny and may be adversely impacted by the results of such scrutiny the regulatory environment with regard to our business is evolving and officials often exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply applicable regulations from time to time we may receive formal and informal inquiries from various government regulatory authorities as well as selfregulatory organizations about our business and compliance with local laws regulations or standards any determination that our operations or activities or the activities of our employees are not in compliance with existing laws regulations or standards could negatively impact us in a number of ways including the imposition of substantial fines interruptions of business loss of supplier vendor or other thirdparty relationships termination of necessary licenses and permits or similar results all of which could potentially harm our business even if an inquiry does not result in these types of determinations it potentially could create negative publicity which could harm our business 

  

our success depends in part on the quality efficacy and safety of our products 

  

our success depends in part on the quality efficacy and safety of our products if our products are found to be defective or unsafe our product claims are found to be deceptive or our products otherwise fail to meet our consumers’ expectations our relationships with customers or consumers could suffer the appeal of one or more of our brands could be diminished and we could lose sales and become subject to liability or claims any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business in addition third parties may sell counterfeit versions of some of our products these counterfeit products may pose safety risks may fail to meet consumers’ expectations and may have a negative impact on our business 

  

  

our success depends in part on our key personnel 

  

our success depends in part on our ability to retain our key personnel including our executive officers and senior management team the unexpected loss of or misconduct by one or more of our key employees could adversely affect our business our success also depends in part on our continuing ability to identify hire train and retain other highly qualified personnel competition for these employees can be intense we may not be able to attract assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business this risk may be exacerbated by the stresses associated with the implementation of our strategic plan and other initiatives 

  

we are subject to risks related to the global scope of our operations 

  

we operate on a global basis with a majority of our fiscal 2019 net sales and operating income generated outside the united states we maintain offices in over 50 countries and have key operational facilities located inside and outside the united states that manufacture warehouse or distribute goods for sale throughout the world our global operations are subject to many risks and uncertainties including 

  

·   fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and the relative costs of operating in different places which can affect our results of operations the value of our foreign assets the relative prices at which we and competitors sell products in the same markets the cost of certain inventory and noninventory items required in our operations and the relative prices at which we sell our products in different markets

  

·   foreign or us laws regulations and policies including restrictions on trade immigration and travel operations and investments currency exchange controls restrictions on imports and exports including license requirements tariffs and taxes

  

·   lack of wellestablished or reliable legal and administrative systems in certain countries in which we operate

  

·   adverse weather conditions and natural disasters and

  

·   social economic and geopolitical conditions such as terrorist attacks war or other military action

  

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

a disruption in our operations or supply chain could adversely affect our business 

  

as a company engaged in manufacturing and distribution on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including industrial accidents environmental events strikes and other labor disputes capacity constraints disruptions in supply chain or information technology loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites or suppliers product quality control safety increase in commodity prices and energy costs licensing requirements and other regulatory issues as well as natural disasters and other external factors over which we have no control if such an event were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

we use a wide variety of direct and indirect suppliers of goods and services from around the world some of our products rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers could subject us to losses or adversely affect our ability to bring products to market further the failure of our suppliers to deliver goods and services in sufficient quantities in compliance with applicable standards and in a timely manner could adversely affect our customer service levels and overall business in addition any increases in the costs of goods and services for our business may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies in our operations 

  

our information technology and websites may be susceptible to cybersecurity breaches outages and other risks 

  

we rely on information technology outsourced and inhouse that support our business processes including product development marketing sales order processing production distribution finance and intracompany communications throughout the world we have ecommerce mcommerce and other internet websites in the united states and many other countries these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire floods power loss telecommunications failures breakins and other events despite the implementation of network security measures our systems may be vulnerable to constantly evolving cybersecurity threats such as malware breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering the occurrence of these or other events could disrupt or damage our information technology and adversely affect our business insurance policies that may provide coverage with regard to such events may not cover any or all of the resulting financial losses 

  

  

failure to adequately maintain the security of our electronic and other confidential information could materially adversely affect our business 

  

we are dependent upon automated information technology processes as part of our normal business activities we collect and store certain information that is confidential proprietary or otherwise sensitive including personal information with respect to customers consumers and employees we may share some of this information with vendors who assist us with certain aspects of our business moreover the success of our ecommerce and mcommerce operations depends upon the secure transmission of confidential and personal data over public networks including the use of cashless payments any failure on the part of us or our vendors to maintain the security of our confidential data and personal information including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information could result in business disruption damage to our reputation financial obligations to third parties fines penalties regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs and also result in deterioration in our employees’ consumers’ and customers’ confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition a security or data privacy breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to enhance our information security systems and could result in a disruption to our operations furthermore third parties including our suppliers and customers may also rely on information technology and be subject to such cybersecurity breaches these breaches may negatively impact their businesses which could in turn disrupt our supply chain andor our business 

  

we are subject to risks associated with our global information technology 

  

our implementation and maintenance of global information technology outsourced and inhouse including supply chain and finance systems human resource management systems creative asset management and retail operating systems as well as associated hardware and use of cloudbased models involve risks and uncertainties failure to implement and maintain these and other systems as planned in terms of timing specifications costs or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

as we outsource functions we become more dependent on the entities performing those functions 

  

as part of our longterm strategy we are continually looking for opportunities to provide essential business services in a more costeffective manner in some cases this requires the outsourcing of functions or parts of functions that can be performed more effectively by external service providers these include certain information technology finance and human resource functions while we believe we conduct appropriate due diligence before entering into agreements with the outsourcing entity the failure of one or more entities to provide the expected services provide them on a timely basis or to provide them at the prices we expect may have a material adverse effect on our business in addition if we transition systems to one or more new or among existing external service providers we may experience challenges that could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

the trading prices of our securities periodically may rise or fall based on the accuracy of predictions of our financial performance 

  

our business planning process is designed to maximize our longterm strength growth and profitability not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter we believe that this longerterm focus is in the best interests of the company and our stockholders at the same time however we recognize that it may be helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our expectations regarding certain aspects of our business this could include forecasts of net sales earnings per share and other financial metrics or projections accordingly when we announced our yearend financial results for fiscal 2019 we provided guidance as to certain assumptions including ranges for our expected net sales and earnings per share for the quarter ending september 30 2019 and the fiscal year ending june 30 2020 while we generally expect to provide updates to our guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter we assume no responsibility to provide additional guidance or update any of our guidance or other forwardlooking statements at such times or otherwise in addition the longerterm guidance we provide is based on goals that we believe at the time guidance is given are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years such targets are more difficult to predict than our current quarter and fiscal year expectations we historically have paid dividends on our common stock and repurchased shares of our class a common stock at any time we could stop or suspend payment of dividends or stop or suspend our stock repurchase program and any such action could cause the market price of our stock to decline

  

in all of our public statements when we make or update a forwardlooking statement about our business whether it be about net sales or earnings expectations or expectations regarding restructuring or other initiatives or otherwise we accompany such statements directly or by reference to a public document with a list of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we expect such a list is included among other places in our earnings press release and in our periodic filings with the sec eg in our reports on form 10k and form 10q these and other factors may make it difficult for us and for outside observers such as research analysts to predict what our earnings or other financial metrics or business outcomes will be in any given fiscal quarter or year 

  

  

outside analysts and investors have the right to make their own predictions of our business for any future period outside analysts however have access to no more material information about our results or plans than any other public investor and we do not endorse their predictions as to our future performance nor do we assume any responsibility to correct the predictions of outside analysts or others when they differ from our own internal expectations if and when we announce actual results that differ from those that outside analysts or others have been predicting the market price of our securities could be affected investors who rely on the predictions of outside analysts or others when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk we take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in the prices of our securities 

  

we are controlled by the lauder family as a result the lauder family has the ability to prevent or cause a change in control or approve prevent or influence certain actions by us 

  

as of august 16 2019 members of the lauder family beneficially own directly or indirectly shares of the company’s class a common stock with one vote per share and class b common stock with 10 votes per share having approximately 86 of the outstanding voting power of the common stock in addition there are four members of the lauder family who are company employees and members of our board of directors 

  

as a result of their stock ownership and positions at the company as well as our dualclass structure the lauder family has the ability to exercise significant control and influence over our business including all matters requiring stockholder approval eg the election of directors amendments to the certificate of incorporation and significant corporate transactions such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets for the foreseeable future in addition if significant stock indices decide to prohibit the inclusion of companies with dualclass stock structures the price of our class a common stock could be negatively impacted and could become more volatile 

  

we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the new york stock exchange rules and as a result are relying on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that are designed to provide protection to stockholders of companies that are not “controlled companies” 

  

the lauder family and their related entities own more than 50 of the total voting power of our common shares and as a result we are a “controlled company” under the new york stock exchange corporate governance standards as a controlled company we are exempt under the new york stock exchange standards from the obligation to comply with certain new york stock exchange corporate governance requirements including the requirements that 1 a majority of our board of directors consists of independent directors 2 we have a nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities and 3 we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities 

  

while we have voluntarily caused our board to have a majority of independent directors and the written charters of our nominating and governance committee and the compensation committee to have the required provisions we are not requiring our nominating and governance committee and compensation committee to be comprised solely of independent directors as a result of our use of the “controlled company” exemptions investors will not have the same protection afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the new york stock exchange corporate governance requirements

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

  

results of operations 

we manufacture market and sell beauty products including those in the skin care makeup fragrance and hair care categories which are distributed in approximately 150 countries and territories the following table is a comparative summary of operating results for fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 and reflects the basis of presentation described in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 2 – summary of significant accounting policies and note 21 – segment data and related information for all periods presented products and services that do not meet our definition of skin care makeup fragrance and hair care have been included in the “other” category 

  

   

as a result of ongoing organizational developments and changes including those arising from our leading beauty forward initiative as described below and certain transfer pricing adjustments among our geographic regions we are reassessing how management reviews the operating performance of these regions including our travel retail business that is currently reflected in europe the middle east  africa this reassessment is expected to be completed by the end of our fiscal 2020 first quarter which could result in a change in how we present the operating results among our geographic regions in future periods 

  

  

the following table presents certain consolidated earnings data as a percentage of net sales 

  

   

we continually introduce new products support new and established products through advertising merchandising and sampling and phase out existing products that no longer meet the needs of our consumers or our objectives the economics of developing producing launching supporting and discontinuing products impact our sales and operating performance each period the introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products which we take into account in our business planning 

  

nongaap financial measures 

  

we use certain nongaap financial measures among other financial measures to evaluate our operating performance which represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business management believes that excluding certain items that are not comparable from period to period helps investors and others compare operating performance between periods while we consider the nongaap measures useful in analyzing our results they are not intended to replace or act as a substitute for any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with us gaap see reconciliations of nongaap financial measures beginning on page 37 for reconciliations between nongaap financial measures and the most directly comparable us gaap measures

  

we operate on a global basis with the majority of our net sales generated outside the united states accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our results of operations therefore we present certain net sales operating results and diluted net earnings per common share information excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations to provide a framework for assessing the performance of our underlying business outside the united states constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant periodoverperiod we calculate constant currency information by translating current year results using prior year weightedaverage foreign currency exchange rates beginning in fiscal 2019 the company adopted a new accounting standard related to hedging that resulted in gainslosses on our foreign currency cash flow hedging activities to now be reflected in net sales where in prior periods they were reflected in cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data –note 11 – derivative financial instruments to better assess our performance in a constant currency environment beginning in fiscal 2019 we are excluding the impact of these hedging activities in our constant currency calculations the revised calculation did not have a significant impact on constant currency information presented for prior periods and therefore has not been restated 

  

  

overview 

  

we believe that the best way to increase stockholder value is to continue providing superior products and services in the most efficient and effective manner while recognizing consumers’ changing behaviors and shopping preferences accordingly our longterm strategy has numerous initiatives across geographic regions product categories brands channels of distribution and functions designed to grow our sales provide cost efficiencies leverage our strengths and make us more productive and profitable   we plan to build upon and leverage our history of outstanding creativity and innovation high quality products and services and engaging communications while investing for longterm sustainable growth 

  

our business is focused on prestige beauty which combines the repeat purchase and relative affordability of consumer goods with the highquality products and hightouch services of luxury goods we are solely focused on prestige beauty yet we are well diversified by brand product category geography channel consumer segment and price point our innovation capabilities driven by our creativity and inspired by data analytics and consumer insights allow us to use our highly desirable brand portfolio to capitalize on opportunities in fast growing and profitable areas of prestige beauty  we believe that our broad and inclusive range of prestige product offerings allows us to increase our share of a consumer’s beauty routine and source consumers from brands sold in massmarket distribution 

  

·   in fiscal 2019 global prestige skin care continued to lead product category growth our skin care business benefited from the enduring strength of hero product lines such as advanced night repair from estée lauder and crème de la mer from la mer as well as recent product launches the growth in asia and targeted expanded consumer reach the launches of advanced night repair eye supercharged complex and micro essence with sakura ferment from estée lauder were particularly successful in asiapacific during fiscal 2019 we introduced a new level of personalization with clinique id which allows the consumer to create a custom blend of hydration and treatment

  

·   global prestige makeup sales also continued to grow however the pace was slower than in prior years our makeup business continued to benefit from growth in hero product lines such as double wear from estée lauder as well as strong demand for m ž a ž c and tom ford in asia and the successful launch of the cushion compact from la mer

  

·   our fragrance category continues to benefit from increased sales of our luxury fragrance brands new products such as honeysuckle and davana from jo malone london and ombre leather from tom ford as well as strength in certain existing product lines have contributed to our success in the category the category also benefited from strong growth and targeted expanded consumer reach of le labo and by kilian increased interest in luxury fragrances in china has also helped category growth we look for further opportunities to strengthen our business in this category through targeted expanded consumer reach of our luxury brands

  

·   in our hair care category our brands are reaching new consumers globally as we further expanded our presence outside the united states during fiscal 2019 aveda launched cherry almond softening shampoo and conditioner and relaunched its popular shampure and rosemary mint lines which also contributed to the category’s growth

  

our global distribution capability and operations allow us to target opportunities wherever consumer demographics and trends are the most attractive our regional organizations and the expertise of our people there enable our brands to be more locally and culturally relevant in both product assortment and communications we are evolving the way we connect with our consumers in stores online and where they travel including by expanding our digital and social media presence and the engagement of global and local influencers to amplify brand or product stories we tailor our strategy by market to drive consumer engagement and embrace cultural diversity we continuously strengthen our presence in large imagebuilding core markets while broadening our presence in emerging markets

  

·   in north america we continue to deploy a number of strategies to accelerate growth despite a challenging environment especially in brick and mortar retail in latin america we continue to launch new brands expand social media outreach and encourage consumers to trade up from mass beauty products

  

·   in europe the middle east  africa we are expanding the consumer reach of many of our brands strengthening their digital and social media presence and leveraging our strength in the makeup category to gain share in prestige beauty

  

·   in asiapacific particularly in china we are leveraging our diversified brand portfolio and expansion on thirdparty online malls to benefit from the strong consumer demand for prestige beauty

  

we approach distribution strategically by product category and geographic region and seek to optimize distribution by matching each of our brands with appropriate opportunities while maintaining high productivity per door we are expanding our brands in higher growth channels such as travel retail and online we also focus on brandbuilding retail activities technologydriven activations and omnichannel capabilities that enhance the luxury experience for consumers 

  

  

·   as part of this strategy we have built a leadership position in the global travel retail channel positioning us well to leverage the increasing international passenger traffic travel retail continues to be an important channel for brand building due to the increase in traveling consumers particularly those from emerging markets who often experience our brands for the first time while traveling we continue to expand our strategic presence in travel retail across dutyfree locations primarily in airports downtown stores inflight and cruise ships we engage consumers at the airport through compelling popup activations in nontraditional commercial areas and we ensure we have appropriate communication and curated assortments to be relevant to targeted consumer groups at the same time travel retail is susceptible to a number of external factors including fluctuations in currency exchange rates and consumers’ willingness and ability to travel and spend 

  

·   online net sales continue to grow strongly on a global basis and we continue to launch e and mcommerce sites in new and existing markets directly with our retail customers or on select thirdparty online malls we collaborate with our retailers globally to drive sales of our products on their online sites we believe our success in delivering particularly strong online growth is a result of customization of our strategy to meet local market and cultural needs we also continue to develop and implement omnichannel concepts to deliver an integrated consumer experience and better serve consumers as they shop across channels

  

while our multiple engines of growth have enabled us to produce excellent sales growth we have also transformed our operations freeing up resources to invest behind further growth opportunities our leading beauty forward initiative described below has enabled us to cut costs and invest in new capabilities such as digital and data analytics as well as increased advertising 

  

in fiscal 2019 we continued to further integrate corporate citizenship and sustainability into our strategy and business operations areas of focus include packaging ingredient transparency responsible sourcing energy and emissions social investments employee engagement and employee safety 

  

while our business is performing well overall we continue to face strong competition globally and economic challenges in certain countries we are cautious of the continued decline in retail traffic primarily related to certain brickandmortar stores in the united states and the united kingdom this is due to the impact of shifts in consumer preferences as to where and how they shop as well as adverse macroeconomic conditions in the united kingdom we continue to monitor the geopolitical tensions between the united states and china and the uncertainties caused by the evolving trade policy dispute which could increase our cost of sales and negatively impact our overall net sales or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business we also continue to monitor the potential implications of the ongoing economic and political uncertainties stemming from the united kingdom’s anticipated exit from the european union ie “brexit” and continue developing our risk mitigation strategies to address such uncertainties these strategies include changes related to regulatory and legislative compliance assessing alternatives to supply chain routing revising customer arrangements and analyzing inventory levels we are also cautious of foreign currency movements including their impact on tourism additionally we continue to monitor the effects of the global macroeconomic environment social and political issues regulatory matters including the imposition of tariffs geopolitical tensions and global security issues 

  

we believe we can to some extent offset the impact of these challenges by continually developing and pursuing a diversified strategy with multiple engines of growth and accelerating areas of strength among our geographic regions product categories brands and channels of distribution however if economic conditions or the degree of uncertainty or volatility worsen or the adverse conditions previously described are further prolonged there could be a negative effect on consumer confidence demand spending and willingness or ability to travel and as a result on our business we will continue to monitor these and other risks that may affect our business 

  

leading beauty forward 

  

in may 2016 we announced a multiyear initiative “leading beauty forward” or the “program” to build on our strengths and better leverage our cost structure to free resources for investment to continue our growth momentum leading beauty forward is designed to enhance our gotomarket capabilities reinforce our leadership in global prestige beauty and continue creating sustainable value as of june 30 2019 we concluded the approvals of all major initiatives under leading beauty forward related to the optimization of select corporate functions supply chain activities and corporate and regional market support structures as well as the exit of underperforming businesses and expect to substantially complete those initiatives through fiscal 2021 we previously estimated that leading beauty forward would result in related restructuring and other charges totaling between 900 million and 950 million before taxes after concluding the final approvals and reviewing the progress of previously approved initiatives under leading beauty forward that are being implemented we have revised our estimates for cost approvals under the program inclusive of approvals from inception through june 30 2019 we now estimate that leading beauty forward may result in related restructuring and other charges totaling between 950 million and 990 million before taxes consisting of employeerelated costs asset writeoffs and other costs to implement these initiatives as many of our previously approved leading beauty forward initiatives are progressing through their implementation stages we are revising our previous estimate of annual net benefits of between 350 million and 450 million before taxes after its full implementation we now expect leading beauty forward to yield annual net benefits primarily in selling general and administrative expenses and to a lesser extent cost of sales of between 425 million and 475 million before taxes these savings can be used to improve margin mitigate risk and invest in future growth initiatives for additional information about restructuring and other charges see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 7 – charges associated with restructuring and other activities  

  

  

annual impairment testing 

  

we assess goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets at least annually for impairment or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist during fiscal 2019 our smashbox reporting unit made revisions to its internal forecasts reflecting the continued slowdown of its makeup business driven by ongoing competitive activity and lower than expected growth in key retail channels for the brand we concluded that these changes in circumstances triggered the need for an interim impairment review of the smashbox trademark and the smashbox reporting unit goodwill accordingly we performed interim impairment tests as of december 31 2018 and march 31 2019 we concluded that the carrying values of the smashbox trademark exceeded their estimated fair values which were determined utilizing a royalty rate to determine discounted projected future cash flows as a result we recognized impairment charges totaling 22 million for the trademark in fiscal 2019 after adjusting the carrying values of the trademark we completed interim quantitative impairment tests for goodwill and recorded goodwill impairment charges related to the smashbox reporting unit totaling 68 million in fiscal 2019 the key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of the reporting unit are predicated on the success of future new product launches the achievement of international distribution expansion plans and the realization of cost reduction and other efficiency efforts if such plans do not materialize or if there are further challenges in the business environment in which this reporting unit operates a resulting change in the key assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and it is possible we could recognize an additional impairment charge as of june 30 2019 the remaining carrying values of the smashbox reporting unit goodwill and smashbox trademark were 72 million and 55 million respectively no further impairment charges were recognized during fiscal 2019   with the exception of the smashbox reporting unit fair values of all reporting units with material goodwill were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values 

  

with regard to trademarks the fair value of the smashbox trademark was equal to its carrying value and the fair values of the too faced editions de parfums frédéric malle and becca trademarks exceeded their carrying values by approximately 7 9 and 14 respectively as of june 30 2019 the carrying values of the too faced editions de parfums frédéric malle and becca trademarks were 525 million 32 million and 98 million respectively if these reporting units are adversely affected by a softness in the retail environment for their products or if other business disruptions arise that cause a change to their longterm financial projections there could be a negative effect on the fair values of the related trademarks and it is possible we could recognize impairment charges in the future

during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 we adopted financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification topic 606 – revenue from contracts with customers “asc 606” the adoption of asc 606 resulted in the deferral of a portion of product sales primarily related to future obligations i to provide gift with purchase and purchase with purchase promotional products and ii to satisfy customer loyalty program reward obligations as well as the timing and classification of certain net demonstration payments to and from customers the collective impact of the adoption of asc 606 reduced reported net sales for fiscal 2019 by 49 million for further information see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 13 – revenue recognition

reported skin care operating income increased in fiscal 2019 primarily from estée lauder and la mer due to higher net sales partially offsetting these increases were higher advertising and promotional activities primarily due to increased spend to support digital advertising and social media including costs associated with influencers locally relevant promotions new product launches and targeted expanded consumer reach

reported makeup operating income decreased in fiscal 2019 driven by lower results from smashbox becca and too faced combined of approximately 207 million the lower results from smashbox reflected the decline in net sales as well as 90 million of goodwill and other intangible asset impairments the decrease in operating income from becca primarily reflected lower net sales as well as an increase in advertising and promotional expenses to support new product launches the lower results from too faced primarily reflected higher cost of sales due in part to new product introductions partially offsetting these decreases were higher results from estée lauder primarily due to higher net sales and greater selling efficiencies 

  

fragrance 

  

   

reported fragrance operating income decreased in fiscal 2019 driven by lower results from jo malone london and certain of our designer fragrances combined of approximately 29 million the increase from jo malone london net sales was more than offset by higher expenses due in part to increases in cost of sales reflecting a change in product mix as well as increases in advertising and promotional activities and store operating costs related to targeted expanded consumer reach the lower results from certain of our designer fragrances reflected lower net sales partially offset by disciplined expense management and selling efficiencies in north america 

  

hair care 

  

   

  

reported hair care operating income decreased in fiscal 2019 due to lower results from bumble and bumble and aveda the lower results from bumble and bumble reflected lower net sales the decrease in operating income from aveda was primarily due to increases in cost of sales advertising and promotion expenses due to spending to support the brand’s social media and digital campaign activity new product launches and digital advertising and shipping expenses due to the net sales increases in our online channel

1 see “reconciliations of nongaap financial measures” beginning on page 37 for reconciliations between nongaap financial measures and the most directly comparable us gaap measures 

  

reported operating income in the americas decreased in fiscal 2019 primarily due to lower net sales in the region the goodwill and other intangible asset impairments related to smashbox and investments in information systems and enhanced capabilities in select corporate functions to support our strategic initiatives this was partially offset by lower selling expenses due to lower demonstration costs partially driven by changes in distribution channel mix as well as efficiencies in our sales operations 

  

europe the middle east  africa 

  

   

reported operating income in europe the middle east  africa increased in fiscal 2019 primarily due to higher results from our travel retail business reflecting the increase in net sales 

  

asiapacific 

  

   

reported operating income in asiapacific increased in fiscal 2019 reflecting higher results in china and hong kong of approximately 135 million combined driven by net sales growth 

  

  

interest and investment income 

  

   

interest expense and interest income and investment income net increased in fiscal 2019 primarily due to higher interest rates also contributing to the increase in interest income and investment income net were higher average investment balances 

  

other income net 

  

the tax cuts and jobs act the “tcja” which was enacted on december 22 2017 presented us with opportunities to manage cash and investments more efficiently on a global basis accordingly during fiscal 2019 as part of the assessment of those opportunities we sold our availableforsale securities which liquidated our investment in the foreign subsidiary that owned those securities as a result we recorded a realized foreign currency gain on liquidation of 77 million and a gross loss on the sale of availableforsale securities of 6 million both of which were reclassified from accumulated oci and are reflected in other income net see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 2 – summary of significant accounting policies – currency translation and transactions for further information

  

provision for income taxes 

  

the provision for income taxes represents us federal foreign state and local income taxes the effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state and local income taxes the tax impact of sharebased compensation the taxation of foreign income and income tax reserve adjustments which represent changes in our net liability for unrecognized tax benefits including tax settlements and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations our effective tax rate will change from quarter to quarter based on recurring and nonrecurring factors including the geographical mix of earnings enacted tax legislation state and local income taxes tax reserve adjustments the tax impact of sharebased compensation and the interaction of various global tax strategies in addition changes in judgment from the evaluation of new information resulting in the recognition derecognition or remeasurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period are recognized separately in the quarter of change 

  

the tcja includes broad and complex changes to the us tax code that impacted our accounting and reporting for income taxes see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 8 – income taxes for further discussion relating to the tcja

  

 

   

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 decreased approximately 2140 basis points the decrease was primarily attributable to the impacts from the tcja recognized in the prior year including the transition tax the adjustment to us net deferred tax assets resulting from the statutory tax rate reduction including the enactment date remeasurement and the establishment of a net deferred tax liability related to foreign withholding taxes on certain foreign earnings the collective impact of these charges is approximately 2260 basis points an additional 40 basis point reduction is primarily related to the collective net impact of the provisions of the tcja which became effective in fiscal 2019 including the reduced us statutory tax rate a foreign derived intangible income deduction “fdii” and a new minimum tax on global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” partially offsetting these decreases were approximately 100 basis points due to an increase in income tax reserve adjustments and approximately 60 basis points relating to the nondeductible smashbox goodwill impairment charge

reconciliations of nongaap financial measures 

  

we use certain nongaap financial measures among other financial measures to evaluate our operating performance which represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business management believes that excluding certain items that are not comparable from period to period or do not reflect the company’s underlying ongoing business provides transparency for such items and helps investors and others compare and analyze our operating performance from period to period in the future we expect to incur charges or adjustments similar in nature to those presented below however the impact to the company’s results in a given period may be highly variable and difficult to predict our nongaap financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by or determined in a manner consistent with other companies while we consider the nongaap measures useful in analyzing our results they are not intended to replace or act as a substitute for any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with us gaap the following tables present net sales operating income and diluted net earnings per common share adjusted to exclude the impact of charges associated with restructuring and other activities goodwill and other intangible asset impairments the changes in the fair value of contingent consideration the gain on liquidation of an investment in a foreign subsidiary net the transition tax the remeasurement of us net deferred tax assets as of the tcja enactment date the establishment of a net deferred tax liability related to foreign withholding taxes on certain foreign earnings resulting from the tcja and the effects of foreign currency translation the tables provide reconciliations between these nongaap financial measures and the most directly comparable us gaap measures

financial condition 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

overview 

  

our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program borrowings from the issuance of longterm debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks and other lenders in the united states and abroad at june 30 2019 we had cash and cash equivalents of 2987 million compared with 2181 million at june 30 2018 our cash and cash equivalents are maintained at a number of financial institutions to mitigate the risk of uninsured balances we select financial institutions based on their credit ratings and financial strength and we perform ongoing evaluations of these institutions to limit our concentration risk exposure 

  

our business is seasonal in nature and accordingly our working capital needs vary from time to time we may enter into investing and financing transactions that require additional funding to the extent that these needs exceed cash from operations we could subject to market conditions issue commercial paper issue longterm debt securities or borrow under our revolving credit facilities 

  

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that cash on hand cash generated from operations availableforsale securities available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business operations information technology enhancements capital expenditures acquisitions dividends stock repurchases restructuring initiatives commitments and other contractual obligations on both a nearterm and longterm basis 

  

the tcja resulted in the transition tax on unrepatriated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and changed the tax law in ways that present opportunities to repatriate cash without additional us federal income tax during fiscal 2018 we changed our indefinite reinvestment assertion related to certain foreign earnings and we continue to analyze the indefinite reinvestment assertion on our remaining applicable foreign earnings our cash and cash equivalents balance at june 30 2019 includes 1765 million of cash in offshore jurisdictions associated with our permanent reinvestment strategy we do not believe that continuing to reinvest our foreign earnings impairs our ability to meet our domestic debt or working capital obligations if these reinvested earnings were repatriated into the united states as dividends we would be subject to state income taxes and applicable foreign taxes in certain jurisdictions 

  

the effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years generally we have been able to introduce new products at higher prices increase prices and implement other operating efficiencies to sufficiently offset cost increases which have been moderate 

  

  

credit ratings 

  

changes in our credit ratings will likely result in changes in our borrowing costs our credit ratings also impact the cost of our revolving credit facility downgrades in our credit ratings may reduce our ability to issue commercial paper andor longterm debt and would likely increase the relative costs of borrowing a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating as of august 16 2019 our longterm debt is rated a with a stable outlook by standard  poor’s and a2 with a stable outlook by moody’s

  

debt and access to liquidity 

  

total debt as a percent of total capitalization excluding noncontrolling interests increased to 44 at june 30 2019 from 43 at june 30 2018 primarily due to the decrease in total equity reflecting higher treasury stock purchases and dividends partially offset by higher net earnings 

  

for further information regarding our current and longterm debt and available financing see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 10 – debt 

  

cash flows 

  

   

the change in net cash flows from operating activities primarily reflected higher cash paid for taxes higher international inventory levels to support our forecasted sales activity an increase in accounts receivable reflecting the timing of shipments and collections and an unfavorable change in accounts payable due to the timing and level of payments these changes were partially offset by higher earnings before taxes 

  

the change in net cash flows from investing activities primarily reflected higher proceeds from the sale of investments and lower purchases of investments primarily due to the liquidation of our foreign subsidiary that owned our availableforsale securities 

  

the change in net cash flows from financing activities primarily reflected higher treasury stock purchases and dividend payments in the current year as well as changes in shortterm debt reflecting the repayment of remaining commercial paper borrowings 

  

see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – financial condition of the company’s annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended june 30 2018 for the fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2017 comparative discussions 

  

dividends

pension and postretirement plan funding 

  

several factors influence the annual funding requirements for our pension plans for our domestic trustbased noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan “us qualified plan” we seek to maintain appropriate funded percentages for any future contributions to the us qualified plan we would seek to contribute an amount or amounts that would not be less than the minimum required by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended “erisa” and subsequent pension legislation and would not be more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes for each international plan our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations in addition amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions    the effect of our pension plan funding on future operating results will depend on economic conditions employee demographics mortality rates the number of participants electing to take lumpsum distributions investment performance and funding decisions 

  

for the us qualified plan we maintain an investment strategy of matching the duration of a substantial portion of the plan assets with the duration of the underlying plan liabilities this strategy assists us in maintaining our overall funded ratio for fiscal 2019 and 2018 we met or exceeded all contribution requirements under erisa regulations for the us qualified plan as we continue to monitor the funded status we may decide to make cash contributions to the us qualified plan or our postretirement medical plan in the united states during fiscal 2020 

  

  

the following table summarizes actual and expected benefit payments and contributions for our other pension and postretirement plans 

  

   

commitments and contingencies 

  

certain of our business acquisition agreements include contingent consideration or “earnout” provisions these provisions generally require that we pay to the seller or sellers of the business additional amounts based on the performance of the acquired business since the size of each payment depends upon performance of the acquired business we do not expect that such payments will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or financial condition 

  

for additional contingencies refer to item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 15 – commitments and contingencies contractual obligations

credit risk 

  

for a discussion of credit risk see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 11 – derivative financial instruments credit risk  

  

market risk 

  

we address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of market risk management that includes the use of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates and to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet to perform a sensitivity analysis of our foreign currency forward contracts we assess the change in fair values from the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates a hypothetical 10 strengthening of the us dollar against the foreign exchange rates for the currencies in our portfolio would have resulted in a net increase in the fair value of our portfolio of approximately 48 million and 10 million as of june 30 2019 and 2018 respectively this potential change does not consider our underlying foreign currency exposures 

  

in addition we enter into interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on our aggregate liability portfolio including future debt issuances based on a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates the estimated fair value of our interest rate derivatives would decrease by approximately 16 million and 24 million as of june 30 2019 and 2018 respectively our sensitivity analysis represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may or may not occur it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated based upon actual fluctuations in market rates operating exposures and the timing thereof and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year we believe however that any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the derivative financial instrument was intended

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

we do not maintain any offbalance sheet arrangements transactions obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities other than operating leases that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations

refer to item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 2 – summary of significant accounting policies for discussion regarding the impact of accounting standards that were recently issued but not yet effective on our consolidated financial statements 

  

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition at june 30 2019 and our results of operations for the three fiscal years ended june 30 2019 are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements these estimates and assumptions can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates we consider accounting estimates to be critical if both i the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and ii the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to the company’s financial condition our critical accounting policies relate to goodwill other intangible assets and longlived assets and income taxes 

  

management of the company has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of the company’s board of directors 

  

goodwill other intangible assets and longlived assets – impairment assessment 

  

goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets other indefinitelived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized 

  

in january 2017 the financial accounting standards board issued authoritative guidance that simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating the second step from the quantitative goodwill impairment test the single quantitative step test requires companies to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and record an impairment charge for the amount that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value up to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit we early adopted this guidance as of the fiscal 2019 second quarter when testing goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment we have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test for fiscal 2019 and 2018 we elected to perform the qualitative assessment for certain of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets this qualitative assessment included the review of certain macroeconomic factors and entityspecific qualitative factors to determine if it was morelikelythannot that the fair values of our reporting units were below carrying value for our other reporting units and other indefinitelived intangible assets a quantitative assessment was performed   we engaged thirdparty valuation specialists and used industry accepted valuation models and criteria that were reviewed and approved by various levels of management 

  

for further discussion of the methods used and factors considered in our estimates as part of the impairment testing for goodwill other intangible assets and longlived assets see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 2 – summary of significant accounting policies and note 6 – goodwill and other intangible assets  

  

income taxes 

  

we calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate as the application of various tax laws relevant to our global business is often uncertain significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions the provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable for the current year the effect of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions 

  

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis net operating losses tax credit and other carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates when the assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled we regularly review deferred tax assets for realizability and establish valuation allowances based on available evidence including historical operating losses projected future taxable income expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and appropriate tax planning strategies if our assessment of the realizability of a deferred tax asset changes an increase to a valuation allowance will result in a reduction of net earnings at that time while the reduction of a valuation allowance will result in an increase of net earnings at that time 

  

  

we provide tax reserves for us federal state local and foreign tax exposures relating to periods subject to audit the development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues potential outcomes and timing and is a subjective critical estimate we assess our tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting dates for those tax positions where it is morelikelythannot that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those tax positions where it is morelikelythannot that a tax benefit will not be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements we classify applicable interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes although the outcome relating to these exposures is uncertain in our opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating from these exposures if actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates they could have a material impact on our consolidated net earnings

marketing 

  

our strategy to market and promote our products begins with our welldiversified portfolio of more than 25 distinctive brands across four product categories our portfolio can be deployed in multiple distribution channels key travel corridors and geographies where our global reputation and awareness of our brands benefit us our geographic and distribution channel diversity allows us to engage local consumers across an array of developed and emerging markets by emphasizing products and services with the greatest local relevance inclusiveness and appeal this strategy is built around “bringing the best to everyone we touch” our founder mrs estée lauder formulated this unique marketing philosophy to provide “hightouch” service and high quality products as the foundation for a solid and loyal consumer base our “hightouch” approach is demonstrated through our integrated consumer engagement models that leverage our product specialists and technology to provide the consumer with a distinct and truly personalized experience that can include personal consultations with beauty advisors in person or online who demonstrate and educate the consumer on product usage and application we plan to continue to leverage our core strengths including the quality of our products our “hightouch” care to consumers and a diversified portfolio of brands channels and geographies 

  

  

our marketing strategies vary by brand local market and distribution channel we have a diverse portfolio of brands and we employ different engagement models suited to each brand’s equity distribution product focus understanding of the core consumer and local relevance this enables us to elevate the consumer experience as we attract new consumers build loyalty drive consumer advocacy and address the transformation of consumer shopping behaviors our marketing planning approach leverages local insights to optimize allocation of resources across different media outlets and retail touch points to resonate with our most discerning consumers most effectively this includes strategically deploying our brands and tailoring product assortments and communications to fit local tastes and preferences in cities and neighborhoods most of our creative marketing work is done by inhouse teams in collaboration with external resources that design and produce the sales materials social media strategies advertisements and packaging for products in each brand for a number of products we create and deploy 360° integrated consumer engagement programs we build brand equity and drive traffic to retail locations and to our own and authorized retailers’ websites through digital and social media magazines and newspapers television billboards in cities and airports and direct mail and email in addition we seek editorial coverage for our brands and products in digital and social media and print to drive influencer amplification 

  

we are increasing our brand awareness and sales through our strategic emphasis on technology by continuing to elevate our digital presence encompassing ecommerce and mcommerce as well as digital social media and influencer marketing we are investing in new analytical capabilities to promote a more personalized experience across our distribution channels we continue to innovate to better meet consumer online shopping preferences eg howto videos ratings and reviews and mobile phone and tablet applications support ecommerce and mcommerce businesses via digital and social marketing activities designed to build brand equity and “hightouch” consumer engagement in order to continue to offer unparalleled service and set the standard for prestige beauty shopping online we also support our authorized retailers to strengthen their ecommerce businesses and drive sales of our brands on their websites we have opportunities to expand our brand portfolio online around the world and we are investing in and testing new omnichannel concepts in the united states china and other markets to increase brand loyalty by better serving consumers as they shop across channels and travel corridors we have dedicated resources to implement creative coordinated brandenhancing strategies across all online activities to increase our direct access to consumers 

  

promotional activities and instore displays are designed to attract new consumers build demand and loyalty and introduce existing consumers to other product offerings from the respective brands our marketing efforts also benefit from cooperative advertising programs with some retailers some of which are supported by coordinated promotions such as sampling programs including purchase with purchase and gift with purchase and we continue to believe that the quality and perceived benefits of sample products have been effective inducements to purchases by new and existing consumers such activities attract consumers to our counters and websites and keep existing consumers engaged our marketing and sales executives spend considerable time in the field meeting with consumers retailers beauty advisors and makeup artists at the points of sale to enable us to offer a seamless experience across channels of distribution 

  

information technology 

  

information technology supports our business processes including product development marketing sales order processing production distribution and finance we continue to maintain and enhance our information technology systems in alignment with our longterm strategy many elements of our global information technology infrastructure are managed by thirdparty providers under vendorowned cloudbased models where we pay for services as they are consumed this allows a more scalable platform to support current and future requirements and improves our agility and flexibility to respond to the demands of the business by leveraging more advanced technologies 

  

we recognize that technology presents opportunities for competitive advantages and we continue to invest in new capabilities across various aspects of our business during fiscal 2018 we completed retail system upgrades to our freestanding stores in north america continued our implementation in asiapacific and began our implementation in europe the middle east and africa over the next few years we plan to implement new systems and capabilities including upgraded retail merchandising solutions in certain key markets globally

manufacturing warehousing and raw materials 

  

we manufacture our products primarily in the united states belgium switzerland the united kingdom and canada we continue to streamline our manufacturing processes and identify sourcing opportunities to improve innovation increase efficiencies minimize our impact on the environment and reduce costs our plants are modern and our manufacturing processes are substantially automated while we believe that our network of manufacturing facilities and thirdparty manufacturers is sufficient to meet current and reasonably anticipated manufacturing requirements we continue to implement improvements in capacity technology and productivity and align our manufacturing with regional sales demand from time to time demand changes may challenge our capacity for certain subcategories on a shortterm basis but we believe that this will not impact our ability to meet our annual or longerterm strategic objectives to capitalize on innovation and other supply chain benefits we also continue to utilize a network of thirdparty manufacturers on a global basis 

  

we have established a global distribution network designed to meet the changing demands of our customers while maintaining service levels we are continuously evaluating and adjusting this physical distribution network we have established regional distribution centers including those maintained by third parties strategically positioned throughout the world in order to facilitate efficient delivery of our products to our customers 

  

the principal raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are essential oils alcohols and specialty chemicals we also purchase packaging components that are manufactured to our design specifications procurement of materials for all manufacturing facilities is generally made on a global basis through our global supplier relations function we review our supplier base periodically with the specific objectives of improving quality increasing innovation and speedtomarket and reducing costs in addition we focus on supply sourcing within the region of manufacture to allow for improved supply chain efficiencies some of our products rely on a single or limited number of suppliers however we believe that our portfolio of suppliers has adequate resources and facilities to overcome most unforeseen interruptions of supply in the past we have been able to obtain an adequate supply of essential raw materials and currently believe we have adequate sources of supply for virtually all components of our products 

  

we are continually benchmarking the performance of our supply chain and augment our supply base and adjust our distribution networks and manufacturing footprint based upon the changing needs of the business as we integrate acquired brands we continually seek new ways to leverage our production and sourcing capabilities to improve our overall supply chain performance

there is significant competition within each market where our skin care makeup fragrance and hair care products are sold brand recognition product quality and effectiveness distribution channels accessibility and price point are some of the factors that impact consumers’ choices among competing products and brands marketing including social media activities merchandising instore experiences and demonstrations and new product innovations also have an impact on consumers’ purchasing decisions with our portfolio of diverse brands sold in a variety of channels we are one of the world’s leading manufacturers and marketers of skin care makeup fragrance and hair care products we compete against a number of companies some of which have substantially greater resources than we do

seasonality 

  

our results of operations in total by region and by product category are subject to seasonal fluctuations with net sales in the first half of the fiscal year typically being slightly higher than in the second half of the fiscal year the higher net sales in the first half of the fiscal year are attributable to the increased levels of purchasing by retailers for the holiday selling season fluctuations in net sales and operating income in total and by geographic region and product category in any fiscal quarter may be attributable to the level and scope of new product introductions or the particular retail calendars followed by our customers that are retailers which may impact their order placement and receipt of goods additionally gross margins and operating expenses are impacted on a quarterbyquarter basis by variations in our launch calendar and the timing of promotions including purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions

the beauty business is highly competitive and if we are unable to compete effectively our results will suffer 

  

we face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world including multinational consumer product companies some of these competitors have greater resources than we do and others are newer companies some backed by privateequity investors competing in distribution channels where we are less represented in some cases our competitors may be able to respond to changing business and economic conditions more quickly than us competition in the beauty business is based on a variety of factors including pricing of products innovation perceived value service to the consumer promotional activities advertising special events new product introductions ecommerce and mcommerce initiatives and other activities it is difficult for us to predict the timing and scale of our competitors’ actions in these areas 

  

  

our ability to compete also depends on the continued strength of our brands our ability to attract and retain key talent and other personnel the efficiency of our manufacturing facilities and distribution network and our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property and those other rights used in our business our company has a wellrecognized and strong reputation that could be negatively impacted by social media and many other factors if our reputation is adversely affected our ability to attract and retain customers and consumers could be impacted in addition certain of our key retailers around the world market and sell competing brands or are owned or otherwise affiliated with companies that market and sell competing brands our inability to continue to compete effectively in key countries around the world could have an adverse impact on our business 

  

our inability to anticipate and respond to market trends and changes in consumer preferences could adversely affect our financial results 

  

our continued success depends on our ability to anticipate gauge and react in a timely and costeffective manner to changes in consumer tastes for skin care makeup fragrance and hair care products attitudes toward our industry and brands as well as to where and how consumers shop we must continually work to develop manufacture and market new products maintain and adapt our “hightouch” services to existing and emerging distribution channels maintain and enhance the recognition of our brands achieve a favorable mix of products successfully manage our inventories and modernize and refine our approach as to how and where we market and sell our products while we devote considerable effort and resources to shape analyze and respond to consumer preferences we recognize that consumer tastes cannot be predicted with certainty and can change rapidly the issue is compounded by the increasing use of digital and social media by consumers and the speed by which information and opinions are shared if we are unable to anticipate and respond to sudden challenges that we may face in the marketplace trends in the market for our products and changing consumer demands and sentiment our financial results will suffer in addition from time to time sales growth or profitability may be concentrated in a relatively small number of our brands channels or countries if such a situation persists or a number of brands channels or countries fail to perform as expected there could be a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

in key markets such as the united states we have seen a decline in retail traffic in some of our department store customers and certain of our freestanding stores we are seeing the emergence of strong e and mcommerce platforms both in mass and prestige distribution that are impacting our business consolidation or liquidation in the retail trade from these or other factors may result in us becoming increasingly dependent on key retailers and could result in an increased risk related to the concentration of our customers a severe adverse impact on the business operations of our customers could have a corresponding material adverse effect on us if one or more of our largest customers change their strategies including pricing or promotional activities or if our relationship with any large customer is changed or terminated for any reason there could be a material adverse effect on our business 

  

our future success depends in part on our ability to achieve our longterm strategy 

  

achieving our longterm strategy will require investment in new capabilities brands categories distribution channels supply chain facilities technologies and emerging and more mature geographic markets these investments may result in shortterm costs without any current sales and therefore may be dilutive to our earnings at least in the short term in addition we may dispose of or discontinue select brands or streamline operations and incur costs or restructuring and other charges in doing so although we believe that our strategy will lead to longterm growth in sales and profitability we may not realize in full or in part the anticipated benefits the failure to realize benefits which may be due to our inability to execute plans global or local economic conditions competition changes in the beauty industry and the other risks described herein could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

acquisitions may expose us to additional risks 

  

we continuously review acquisition and strategic investment opportunities that would expand our current product offerings our distribution channels increase the size and geographic scope of our operations or otherwise offer growth and operating efficiency opportunities there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate these transactions on favorable terms if required the financing for these transactions could result in an increase in our indebtedness dilute the interests of our stockholders or both the purchase price for some acquisitions may include additional amounts to be paid in cash in the future a portion of which may be contingent on the achievement of certain future operating results of the acquired business if the performance of any such acquired business exceeds such operating results then we may incur additional charges and be required to pay additional amounts 

  

acquisitions including strategic investments or alliances entail numerous risks which may include 

  

·   difficulties in integrating acquired operations or products including the loss of key employees from or customers of acquired businesses

·   diversion of management ’ s attention from our existing businesses

·   adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers

·   adverse impacts of margin and product cost structures different from those of our current mix of business and

·   risks of entering distribution channels categories or markets in which we have limited or no prior experience

  

  

our failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business or to achieve the longterm plan for such business as well as any other adverse consequences associated with our acquisition and investment activities could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

  

completed acquisitions typically result in additional goodwill andor an increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet we are required at least annually or as facts and circumstances exist to test goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to determine if impairment has occurred if the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the fair value of other intangible assets with indefinite lives in the period the determination is made we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

a general economic downturn or sudden disruption in business conditions may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items andor the financial strength of our customers that are retailers which could adversely affect our financial results 

  

the general level of consumer spending is affected by a number of factors including general economic conditions inflation interest rates energy costs and consumer confidence generally all of which are beyond our control consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower and may impact sales of our products a decline in consumer purchases of discretionary items also tends to impact our customers that are retailers we generally extend credit to a retailer based on an evaluation of its financial condition usually without requiring collateral however the financial difficulties of a retailer could cause us to curtail or eliminate business with that customer we may also assume more credit risk relating to the receivables from that retailer our inability to collect receivables from our largest customers or from a group of customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition if a retailer was to liquidate we may incur additional costs if we choose to purchase the retailer’s inventory of our products to protect brand equity 

  

in addition sudden disruptions in business conditions for example from events such as a pandemic or other local or global health issues conflicts around the world or as a result of a terrorist attack retaliation or similar threats or as a result of adverse weather conditions climate changes or seismic events can have a shortterm and sometimes longterm impact on consumer spending 

  

events that impact consumers’ willingness or ability to travel andor purchase our products while traveling may impact our business including travel retail a significant contributor to our overall results and our strategy to market and sell products to international travelers at their destinations 

  

a downturn in the economies of or continuing recessions in the countries where we sell our products or a sudden disruption of business conditions in those countries could adversely affect consumer confidence the financial strength of our retailers and our sales and profitability we are cautious of the continued decline in retail traffic primarily related to certain brickandmortar stores in the united states and the united kingdom as a result of the impact of shifts in consumer preferences as to where and how they shop we are also cautious of foreign currency movements including their impact on tourism additionally we continue to monitor the effects of the macroeconomic environments in certain countries such as brazil and in the middle east the united kingdom’s anticipated exit from the european union social and political issues regulatory matters including the imposition of tariffs geopolitical tensions and global security issues 

  

volatility in the financial markets and a related economic downturn in key markets or markets generally throughout the world could have a material adverse effect on our business while we currently generate significant cash flows from our ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities credit markets may experience significant disruptions deterioration in global financial markets or an adverse change in our credit ratings could make future financing difficult or more expensive if any financial institutions that are parties to our undrawn revolving credit facility or other financing arrangements such as foreign exchange or interest rate hedging instruments were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us this could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain foreign currency or interest rate exposures which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

changes in laws regulations and policies that affect our business could adversely affect our financial results 

  

our business is subject to numerous laws regulations and policies changes in the laws regulations and policies including the interpretation or enforcement thereof that affect our business could adversely affect our financial results these changes include accounting standards tax laws and regulations laws and regulations relating to data privacy anticorruption advertising marketing manufacturing distribution product registration ingredients chemicals and packaging as well as laws in europe and elsewhere relating to selective distribution environmental or climate change laws regulations or accords trade rules and customs regulations 

  

  

we are involved and may become involved in the future in disputes and other legal or regulatory proceedings that could adversely affect our financial results 

  

we are and may in the future become party to litigation other disputes or regulatory proceedings in general claims made by us or against us in litigation disputes or other proceedings can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements injunctions or damages that could significantly affect our business or financial results we are currently vigorously contesting certain of these claims however it is not possible to predict the final resolution of the litigation disputes or proceedings to which we currently are or may in the future become party to and the impact of certain of these matters on our business results of operations and financial condition could be material 

  

government reviews inquiries investigations and actions could harm our business or reputation 

  

as we operate in various locations around the world our operations in certain countries are subject to significant governmental scrutiny and may be adversely impacted by the results of such scrutiny the regulatory environment with regard to our business is evolving and officials often exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply applicable regulations from time to time we may receive formal and informal inquiries from various government regulatory authorities as well as selfregulatory organizations about our business and compliance with local laws regulations or standards any determination that our operations or activities or the activities of our employees are not in compliance with existing laws regulations or standards could negatively impact us in a number of ways including the imposition of substantial fines interruptions of business loss of supplier vendor or other thirdparty relationships termination of necessary licenses and permits or similar results all of which could potentially harm our business andor reputation even if an inquiry does not result in these types of determinations it potentially could create negative publicity which could harm our business andor reputation 

  

our success depends in part on the quality efficacy and safety of our products 

  

our success depends in part on the quality efficacy and safety of our products if our products are found to be defective or unsafe our product claims are found to be deceptive or our products otherwise fail to meet our consumers’ expectations our relationships with customers or consumers could suffer the appeal of one or more of our brands could be diminished and we could lose sales andor become subject to liability or claims any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition third parties may sell counterfeit versions of some of our products these counterfeit products may pose safety risks may fail to meet consumers’ expectations and may have a negative impact on our reputation 

  

our success depends in part on our key personnel 

  

our success depends in part on our ability to retain our key personnel including our executive officers and senior management team the unexpected loss of one or more of our key employees could adversely affect our business our success also depends in part on our continuing ability to identify hire train and retain other highly qualified personnel competition for these employees can be intense we may not be able to attract assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business this risk may be exacerbated by the stresses associated with the implementation of our strategic plan and other initiatives 

  

we are subject to risks related to the global scope of our operations 

  

we operate on a global basis with a majority of our fiscal 2018 net sales and operating income generated outside the united states 

we maintain offices in over 50 countries and have key operational facilities located inside and outside the united states that manufacture warehouse or distribute goods for sale throughout the world our global operations are subject to many risks and uncertainties including 

  

·   fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and the relative costs of operating in different places which can affect our results of operations the value of our foreign assets the relative prices at which we and competitors sell products in the same markets the cost of certain inventory and noninventory items required in our operations and the relative prices at which we sell our products in different markets

·   foreign or us laws regulations and policies including restrictions on trade immigration and travel operations and investments currency exchange controls restrictions on imports and exports including license requirements tariffs and taxes

·   lack of wellestablished or reliable legal and administrative systems in certain countries in which we operate

·   social economic and geopolitical conditions such as terrorist attacks war or other military action

  

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects reputation results of operations and financial condition 

  

  

a disruption in our operations or supply chain could adversely affect our business and financial results 

  

as a company engaged in manufacturing and distribution on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including industrial accidents environmental events strikes and other labor disputes disruptions in supply chain or information technology loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites or suppliers product quality control safety increase in commodity prices and energy costs licensing requirements and other regulatory issues as well as natural disasters and other external factors over which we have no control if such an event were to occur it could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

  

we use a wide variety of direct and indirect suppliers of goods and services from around the world some of our products rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers could subject us to losses or adversely affect our ability to bring products to market further the failure of our suppliers to deliver goods and services in sufficient quantities in compliance with applicable standards and in a timely manner could adversely affect our customer service levels and overall business in addition any increases in the costs of goods and services for our business may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies in our operations 

  

our information technology and websites may be susceptible to cybersecurity breaches outages and other risks 

  

we rely on information technology outsourced and inhouse that support our business processes including product development marketing sales order processing production distribution finance and intracompany communications throughout the world we have ecommerce mcommerce and other internet websites in the united states and many other countries these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire floods power loss telecommunications failures breakins and other events despite the implementation of network security measures our systems may be vulnerable to constantly evolving cybersecurity threats such as computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering the occurrence of these or other events could disrupt or damage our information technology and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

failure to adequately maintain the security of our electronic and other confidential information could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

  

we are dependent upon automated information technology processes as part of our normal business activities we collect and store certain information that is confidential proprietary or otherwise sensitive including personal information with respect to customers consumers and employees we may share some of this information with vendors who assist us with certain aspects of our business moreover the success of our ecommerce and mcommerce operations depends upon the secure transmission of confidential and personal data over public networks including the use of cashless payments any failure on the part of us or our vendors to maintain the security of our confidential data and personal information including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information could result in business disruption damage to our reputation financial obligations to third parties fines penalties regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs and also result in deterioration in our employees’ consumers’ and customers’ confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages and thus could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a security or data privacy breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to enhance our information security systems and could result in a disruption to our operations furthermore third parties including our suppliers and customers may also rely on information technology and be subject to such cybersecurity breaches these breaches may negatively impact their businesses which could in turn disrupt our supply chain andor our business operations 

  

we are subject to risks associated with our global information technology 

  

our implementation and maintenance of global information technology outsourced and inhouse including supply chain and finance systems human resource management systems creative asset management and retail operating systems as well as associated hardware and use of cloud based models involve risks and uncertainties failure to implement and maintain these and other systems as planned in terms of timing specifications costs or otherwise could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

  

as we outsource functions we become more dependent on the entities performing those functions 

  

as part of our longterm strategy we are continually looking for opportunities to provide essential business services in a more costeffective manner in some cases this requires the outsourcing of functions or parts of functions that can be performed more effectively by external service providers these include certain information technology finance and human resource functions while we believe we conduct appropriate due diligence before entering into agreements with the outsourcing entity the failure of one or more entities to provide the expected services provide them on a timely basis or to provide them at the prices we expect may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition in addition if we transition systems to one or more new or among existing external service providers we may experience challenges that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

  

  

the trading prices of our securities periodically may rise or fall based on the accuracy of predictions of our financial performance 

  

our business planning process is designed to maximize our longterm strength growth and profitability not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter we believe that this longerterm focus is in the best interests of the company and our stockholders at the same time however we recognize that it may be helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our expectations regarding certain aspects of our business this could include forecasts of net sales earnings per share and other financial metrics or projections accordingly when we announced our yearend financial results for fiscal 2018 we provided guidance as to certain assumptions including ranges for our expected net sales and earnings per share for the quarter ending september 30 2018 and the fiscal year ending june 30 2019 while we generally expect to provide updates to our guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter we assume no responsibility to provide additional guidance or update any of our guidance or other forwardlooking statements at such times or otherwise in addition the longerterm guidance we provide is based on goals that we believe at the time guidance is given are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years such targets are more difficult to predict than our current quarter and fiscal year expectations we historically have paid dividends on our common stock and repurchased shares of our class a common stock at any time we could stop or suspend payment of dividends or stop or suspend our stock repurchase program and any such action could cause the market price of our stock to decline 

  

in all of our public statements when we make or update a forwardlooking statement about our business whether it be about net sales andor earnings expectations or expectations regarding restructuring or other initiatives or otherwise we accompany such statements directly or by reference to a public document with a list of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we expect such a list is included among other places in our earnings press release and in our periodic filings with the sec eg in our reports on form 10k and form 10q these and other factors may make it difficult for us and for outside observers such as research analysts to predict what our earnings or other financial metrics or business outcomes will be in any given fiscal quarter or year 

  

outside analysts and investors have the right to make their own predictions of our business or financial results for any future period outside analysts however have access to no more material information about our results or plans than any other public investor and we do not endorse their predictions as to our future performance nor do we assume any responsibility to correct the predictions of outside analysts or others when they differ from our own internal expectations if and when we announce actual results that differ from those that outside analysts or others have been predicting the market price of our securities could be affected investors who rely on the predictions of outside analysts or others when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk we take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in the prices of our securities 

  

we are controlled by the lauder family as a result the lauder family has the ability to prevent or cause a change in control or approve prevent or influence certain actions by us 

  

as of august 17 2018 members of the lauder family beneficially own directly or indirectly shares of the company’s class a common stock with one vote per share and class b common stock with 10 votes per share having approximately 87 of the outstanding voting power of the common stock in addition there are four members of the lauder family who are company employees and members of our board of directors another family member is a party to a consulting agreement and a license agreement with us 

  

as a result of their stock ownership and positions at the company as well as our dualclass structure the lauder family has the ability to exercise significant control and influence over our business including all matters requiring stockholder approval eg the election of directors amendments to the certificate of incorporation and significant corporate transactions such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets for the foreseeable future in addition if significant stock indices decide to prohibit the inclusion of companies with dualclass stock structures the price of our class a common stock could be negatively impacted and could become more volatile 

  

we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the new york stock exchange rules and as a result are relying on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that are designed to provide protection to stockholders of companies that are not “controlled companies” 

  

the lauder family and their related entities own more than 50 of the total voting power of our common shares and as a result we are a “controlled company” under the new york stock exchange corporate governance standards as a controlled company we are exempt under the new york stock exchange standards from the obligation to comply with certain new york stock exchange corporate governance requirements including the requirements that 1 a majority of our board of directors consists of independent directors 2 we have a nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities and 3 we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities 

  

  

while we have voluntarily caused our board to have a majority of independent directors and the written charters of our nominating and board affairs committee and the compensation committee to have the required provisions we are not requiring our nominating and board affairs committee and compensation committee to be comprised solely of independent directors as a result of our use of the “controlled company” exemptions investors will not have the same protection afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the new york stock exchange corporate governance requirements

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

  

results of operations 

we manufacture market and sell beauty products including those in the skin care makeup fragrance and hair care categories which are distributed in over 150 countries and territories the following table is a comparative summary of operating results for fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 and reflects the basis of presentation described in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 2 – summary of significant accounting policies and note 20 – segment data and related information for all periods presented products and services that do not meet our definition of skin care makeup fragrance and hair care have been included in the “other” category 

  

   

  

the following table presents certain consolidated earnings data as a percentage of net sales 

  

   

in order to meet the demands of consumers we continually introduce new products support new and established products through advertising merchandising and sampling and phase out existing products that no longer meet the needs of our consumers or our objectives the economics of developing producing launching supporting and discontinuing products impact our sales and operating performance each period the introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products which we take into account in our business planning 

  

nongaap financial measures 

  

we use certain nongaap financial measures among other financial measures to evaluate our operating performance which represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business management believes that excluding certain items that are not comparable from period to period helps investors and others compare operating performance between periods while we consider the nongaap measures useful in analyzing our results they are not intended to replace or act as a substitute for any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with us gaap see reconciliations of nongaap financial measures beginning on page 39 for reconciliations between nongaap financial measures and the most directly comparable us gaap measures

  

we operate on a global basis with the majority of our net sales generated outside the united states accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our results of operations therefore we present certain net sales operating results and diluted net earnings per common share information excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations to provide a framework for assessing the performance of our underlying business outside the united states constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant periodoverperiod we calculate constant currency information by translating current year results using prior year weightedaverage foreign currency exchange rates 

  

overview 

  

we believe the best way to increase stockholder value is to continue providing superior products and services in the most efficient and effective manner while recognizing consumers’ changing behaviors and shopping preferences accordingly our longterm strategy has numerous initiatives across geographic regions product categories brands channels of distribution and functions designed to grow our sales provide cost efficiencies leverage our strengths and make us more productive and profitable   we plan to build upon and leverage our history of outstanding creativity and innovation high quality products and services and engaging communications while investing for longterm sustainable growth 

  

  

our balanced diverse and highly desirable brand portfolio positions us well to capitalize on opportunities in fast growing and profitable areas of prestige beauty  we believe that our broad and inclusive range of prestige product offerings allows us to increase our share of a consumer’s beauty routine and source consumers from brands sold in massmarket distribution 

  

·   in fiscal 2018 we have seen a resurgence of global prestige skin care growth our skin care product category benefited from the enduring strength of hero product lines such as advanced night repair from estée lauder and crème de la mer from la mer as well as recent product launches and targeted expanded consumer reach the launches of advanced night repair eye concentrate matrix and perfectionist pro rapid firm  lift treatment from estée lauder were particularly successful in china and certain travel retail locations in asiapacific during fiscal 2018 we continued to expand the crème de la mer and genaissance de la mer product lines from la mer through the introduction of the moisturizing matte lotion the moisturizing cool gel creme the eye  expression cream and the infused lotion

  

·   global prestige makeup sales also continued to grow however the pace was slower than in prior periods we continued to benefit from growth in hero product lines such as double wear and pure color envy from estée lauder as well as incremental net sales from too faced and becca which we acquired during fiscal 2017 most of our brands also benefited from strong demand for makeup particularly in china and hong kong

  

·   our fragrance category continues to benefit from increased sales of our luxury fragrance brands new product lines such as the english fields collection from jo malone london and the oud wood franchise from tom ford as well as strength in certain existing product lines have contributed to our success in the category the category also benefited from strong growth and targeted expanded consumer reach of le labo and by kilian increased interest in luxury fragrances in asia has also helped category growth we look for further opportunities to strengthen our business in this category there through targeted expanded consumer reach of our luxury brands

  

·   in our hair care category our brands are reaching new consumers globally as we further expanded our presence in the travel retail online and specialtymulti channels such as the launch of bumble and bumble in ulta beauty during fiscal 2018 the invati advanced product line launch from aveda also contributed to the success in the category

  

our global footprint provides many avenues of potential growth our regional organizations and the expertise of our people there enable our brands to be more locally and culturally relevant in both product assortment and communications we are evolving the way we connect with our consumers in stores online and where they travel including by expanding our digital and social media presence and the engagement of global and local influencers to amplify brand or product stories we tailor our strategy by market to drive consumer engagement and embrace an authentic understanding of cultural diversity we continuously strengthen our presence in large imagebuilding core markets such as the united states the united kingdom and japan and broaden our presence in emerging markets including those in the middle east india russia south africa brazil and mexico

  

·   in north america we continue to deploy a number of strategies to accelerate growth despite a challenging environment especially in brick and mortar retail and in latin america we continue to launch new brands expand social media outreach and encourage consumers to trade up from mass beauty products

  

·   in europe the middle east  africa we are expanding the consumer reach of many of our brands strengthening their digital and social media presence and leveraging our strength in the makeup category to gain share in prestige beauty

  

·   in asiapacific particularly in china we are leveraging our diversified brand portfolio and expansion on thirdparty online platforms to benefit from the strong consumer demand for prestige beauty

  

we approach distribution strategically by product category and geographic region and seek to optimize distribution by matching each of our brands with appropriate opportunities while maintaining high productivity per door we are expanding certain brands into geographic markets where we see opportunities to fuel our sales growth this includes adding brands to higher growth channels such as travel retail thirdparty online platforms e and mcommerce and specialtymulti brand retailers we also focus on brandbuilding retail activities that will expand consumer coverage for our brands 

  

·   as part of this strategy we continue to build and diversify our business in the travel retail channel around the world across brands and product categories travel retail continues to be an important channel for brand building and profit margin expansion due to the increase in traveling consumers particularly those from china across multiple travel corridors we continue to invest in digital and social media platforms and advertising while focusing on locally relevant product assortment and communication skills of our representatives at the same time travel retail is susceptible to a number of external factors including fluctuations in currency exchange rates and consumers’ willingness and ability to travel and spend 

  

  

·   online net sales continue to grow strongly on a global basis and we continue to launch e and mcommerce sites in new and existing markets directly with our retail customers or on select thirdparty online platforms we collaborate with our retailers and thirdparty online platforms globally to drive sales of our products on their online sites we believe our success in delivering particularly strong online growth is a result of customization of our strategy to meet local market and cultural needs we also continue to develop and implement omnichannel concepts to deliver an integrated consumer experience and better serve consumers as they shop across channels 

  

while our business is performing well overall we continue to face strong competition globally and economic challenges in certain countries in particular we are cautious of the continued decline in retail traffic primarily related to certain brickandmortar stores in the united states and the united kingdom as a result of the impact of shifts in consumer preferences as to where and how they shop we are also cautious of foreign currency movements including their impact on tourism additionally we continue to monitor the effects of the macroeconomic environments in certain countries such as brazil and in the middle east the united kingdom’s anticipated exit from the european union social and political issues regulatory matters including the imposition of tariffs geopolitical tensions and global security issues 

  

we believe we can to some extent offset the impact of these challenges by developing and pursuing a diversified strategy with multiple engines of growth and accelerating areas of strength among our geographic regions product categories brands and channels of distribution however if economic conditions or the degree of uncertainty or volatility worsen or the adverse conditions previously described are further prolonged there could be a negative effect on consumer confidence demand spending and willingness or ability to travel and as a result on our business we will continue to monitor these and other risks that may affect our business 

  

as disclosed in the company’s form 10q for the fiscal 2018 third quarter we learned that some of our testing related to certain product advertising claims did not meet our standards necessitating further validation as a result of this ongoing review certain advertising claims are being modified this is not a product safety issue and does not relate to the quality of the ingredients or the manufacturing of our products based on our review to date we do not believe this matter will be material to the company 

  

we navigate through shortterm volatility while focusing on our longterm strategy and using our multiple engines of growth that we believe will help promote sustainable results we are increasing our presence in emerging markets continuing efforts to revitalize and accelerate growth in our heritage brands focusing on key demographics and seeking opportunities to add to our diverse brand portfolio we are also strengthening our consumer engagement by leveraging digital marketing and enhancing our social media strategies and execution we will continue to drive product packaging and conceptual innovation and creativity that we believe enable us to introduce products that resonate with consumers some initiatives will involve new subcategories and others may expand key franchises 

  

leading beauty forward 

  

in may 2016 we announced a multiyear initiative “leading beauty forward” or the “program” to build on our strengths and better leverage our cost structure to free resources for investment to continue our growth momentum leading beauty forward is designed to enhance our gotomarket capabilities reinforce our leadership in global prestige beauty and continue creating sustainable value we plan to approve specific initiatives under leading beauty forward through fiscal 2019 related to the optimization of select corporate functions supply chain activities and corporate and regional market support structures as well as the exit of underperforming businesses and expect to complete those initiatives through fiscal 2021 we previously estimated that leading beauty forward would result in related restructuring and other charges totaling between 600 million and 700 million before taxes after reviewing additional potential initiatives and the progress of previously approved initiatives under leading beauty forward that are being implemented we have revised our estimates for cost approvals under the program inclusive of approvals from inception through june 30 2018 we now estimate that leading beauty forward may result in related restructuring and other charges totaling between 900 million and 950 million before taxes consisting of employeerelated costs asset writeoffs and other costs to implement these initiatives as many of our previously approved leading beauty forward initiatives are progressing through their implementation stages and with the identification of potential new initiatives we are revising our previous estimate of annual net benefits of between 200 million and 300 million before taxes after its full implementation we now expect leading beauty forward to yield annual net benefits primarily in selling general and administrative expenses of between 350 million and 450 million before taxes these savings can be used to improve margin mitigate risk and invest in future growth initiatives for additional information about restructuring and other charges see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 7 – charges associated with restructuring and other activities  

  

  

annual impairment testing 

  

we assess goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets at least annually for impairment or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist during fiscal 2018 no impairment charges were recognized as a result of our annual goodwill and other intangible asset impairment testing as of april 1 2018 the fair values of all reporting units with material goodwill were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values 

  

with regard to trademarks the fair value of the editions de parfums frédéric malle trademark was equal to its carrying value and the fair value of the too faced trademark exceeded its carrying value by approximately 14 as of june 30 2018 the carrying values of the editions de parfums frédéric malle and too faced trademarks were 33 million and 525 million respectively if these reporting units are adversely affected by a softness in the retail environment for their products or if other business disruptions arise that cause a change to their longterm financial projections there could be a negative effect on the fair values of the related trademarks and it is possible we could recognize an impairment charge in the future 

  

based on our annual goodwill and other intangible asset impairment testing during fiscal 2017 we recorded impairment charges related to the goodwill and trademark of the editions de parfums frédéric malle reporting unit and impairment charges for the remaining goodwill and intangible assets related to the rodin olio lusso reporting unit of 31 million combined for additional information see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 6 – goodwill and other intangible assets

the lower net sales of clinique products primarily reflected a soft retail environment for our products particularly in our travel retail business asiapacific and to a lesser extent the united kingdom and brickandmortar department stores in the united states the lower net sales from m ž a ž c were driven by slower retail traffic in brickandmortar stores in the united states reflecting the impact of shifts in consumer preferences as to where and how they shop

provision for income taxes 

  

the provision for income taxes represents us federal foreign state and local income taxes the effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state and local income taxes the taxation of foreign income and income tax reserve adjustments which represent changes in our net liability for unrecognized tax benefits including tax settlements and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations our effective tax rate will change based on recurring and nonrecurring factors including but not limited to the geographical mix of earnings enacted tax legislation state and local income taxes tax reserve adjustments the ultimate disposition of deferred tax assets relating to stockbased compensation and the interaction of various global tax strategies in addition changes in judgment from the evaluation of new information resulting in the recognition derecognition or remeasurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period are recognized separately in the quarter of change 

  

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tcja” the tcja includes broad and complex changes to the us tax code that impacted our accounting and reporting for income taxes in the current year including 

  

·   a reduction in the us federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 which resulted in a fiscal 2018 us blended statutory income tax rate of 281 

·   a onetime mandatory deemed repatriation tax on unremitted foreign earnings “transition tax” which may be paid over an eightyear period 

·   a remeasurement of us net deferred tax assets 

  

in addition as a result of the transition tax we established a net deferred tax liability related to foreign withholding taxes in connection with the reversal of our indefinite reinvestment assertion related to certain foreign earnings 

  

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 8 – income taxes for further discussion relating to the tcja 

  

  

   

1 all periods ex clude the net impact on the effective tax rate of charges associated with restructuring and other activities and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration fiscal 2018 was adjusted for the impact of the provisional adjustments resulting from the enactment of the tcja fiscal 2017 was adjusted for the impact of the tax law change in china and goodwill and other intangible asset impairments 

  

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 increased approximately 2130 basis points the increase was primarily attributable to the impacts from the tcja including the transition tax of approximately 1770 basis points the impact to us net deferred tax assets resulting from the statutory tax rate reduction including the enactment date remeasurement of approximately 270 basis points and the establishment of a net deferred tax liability related to foreign withholding taxes on certain foreign earnings of approximately 230 basis points also contributing to the increase was the impact in the prior year of the tax law change in china which expanded the corporate income tax deduction allowance for advertising and promotional expenses and reduced the prior year tax rate by approximately 460 basis points partially offsetting these increases was approximately 250 basis points due to the favorable impact of excess tax benefits related to sharebased compensation awards the remaining change of approximately 350 basis points was primarily related to the favorable impact of the reduced us statutory tax rate 

  

the effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 decreased approximately 460 basis points due to the reversal of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance the “china deferred tax asset valuation allowance reversal” the deferred tax asset and associated valuation allowance related to the accumulated carryforward of excess advertising and promotional expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 a favorable change to the tax law in china was enacted that expanded the corporate income tax deduction allowance for advertising and promotional expenses resulting in this change in realizability of the asset also contributing to this decrease was a reduction in income tax reserve adjustments of approximately 100 basis points

reconciliations of nongaap financial measures

financial condition 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

overview 

  

our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program borrowings from the issuance of longterm debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks and other lenders in the united states and abroad at june 30 2018 we had cash and cash equivalents of 2181 million compared with 1136 million at june 30 2017 our cash and cash equivalents are maintained at a number of financial institutions to mitigate the risk of uninsured balances we select financial institutions based on their credit ratings and financial strength and we perform ongoing evaluations of these institutions to limit our concentration risk exposure 

  

in addition we purchase short and longterm investments pursuant to our cash investment strategy our investment objectives include capital preservation maintaining adequate liquidity asset diversification and achieving appropriate returns within the guidelines set forth in our investment policy these investments are classified as availableforsale and totaled 1222 million and 1498 million at june 30 2018 and 2017 respectively

  

our business is seasonal in nature and accordingly our working capital needs vary from time to time we may enter into investing and financing transactions that require additional funding to the extent that these needs exceed cash from operations we could subject to market conditions issue commercial paper issue longterm debt securities or borrow under our revolving credit facilities 

  

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that cash on hand cash generated from operations availableforsale securities available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business operations information technology enhancements capital expenditures acquisitions dividends stock repurchases restructuring initiatives commitments and other contractual obligations on both a nearterm and longterm basis 

  

the recently enacted tcja resulted in the transition tax on unrepatriated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and changed the tax law in ways that present opportunities to repatriate cash without additional us federal income tax during fiscal 2018 we changed our indefinite reinvestment assertion related to certain foreign earnings and continue to analyze the indefinite reinvestment assertion on our remaining applicable foreign earnings our cash and cash equivalents and short and longterm investment balances at june 30 2018 include 1068 million of cash and short and longterm investments in offshore jurisdictions associated with our permanent reinvestment strategy we do not believe that continuing to reinvest our foreign earnings impairs our ability to meet our domestic debt or working capital obligations if these reinvested earnings were repatriated into the united states as dividends we would be subject to state income taxes and applicable foreign taxes in certain jurisdictions 

  

the effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years generally we have been able to introduce new products at higher prices increase prices and implement other operating efficiencies to sufficiently offset cost increases which have been moderate 

  

  

credit ratings 

  

changes in our credit ratings will likely result in changes in our borrowing costs our credit ratings also impact the cost of our revolving credit facility downgrades in our credit ratings may reduce our ability to issue commercial paper andor longterm debt and would likely increase the relative costs of borrowing a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating as of august 17 2018 our commercial paper is rated a1 by standard  poor’s and p1 by moody’s and our longterm debt is rated a with a stable outlook by standard  poor’s and a2 with a stable outlook by moody’s

  

debt and access to liquidity 

  

total debt as a percent of total capitalization excluding noncontrolling interests decreased to 43 at june 30 2018 from 45 at june 30 2017 primarily due to the increase in total equity reflecting higher net earnings partially offset by higher treasury stock purchases 

  

for further information regarding our current and longterm debt and available financing see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 10 – debt 

  

cash flows 

  

   

the fiscal 2018 increase in net cash provided by operating activities as compared with fiscal 2017 primarily reflected higher earnings before income taxes and an increase in accounts payable primarily due to extended supplier payment terms also contributing to the improvement was a decrease in other assets reflecting the collection of taxes receivable resulting from the fiscal 2017 change to the tax law in china and an increase in other accrued and noncurrent liabilities due in part to an increase in accrued employee incentive compensation and a change in legal accruals in the prior year the impact of the tcja which lowered net earnings contributed an increase of 351 million in other accrued and noncurrent liabilities reflecting the transition tax as well as 87 million combined relating to the decrease in us net deferred tax assets due to the statutory tax rate reduction and withholding taxes on certain foreign earnings the transition tax may be paid over an eightyear period of which 31 million is classified as shortterm these charges did not have a material impact on our reported cash flows from operations as of june 30 2018 

  

the fiscal 2017 increase in net cash provided by operating activities as compared with fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by an increase in net earnings a decrease in discretionary pension and postretirement benefit contributions and a favorable change in accounts receivable due to the timing of shipments and collections these improvements were partially offset by unfavorable changes in accounts payable primarily due to the timing of payments and other accrued and noncurrent liabilities related to a change in legal accruals accrued professional fees and accrued employee incentive compensation partially offset by advertising and promotional accruals the overall change in cash flows from certain working capital components was impacted by our fiscal 2017 acquisitions 

  

the fiscal 2018 decrease in net cash used for investing activities reflected cash paid in the fiscal 2017 second quarter related to the acquisitions of too faced and becca and lower purchases net of proceeds of investments in connection with our cash investment strategy partially offsetting these changes was an increase in capital expenditures primarily related to counters 

  

the fiscal 2017 increase in net cash used for investing activities primarily reflected cash paid in connection with the fiscal 2017 second quarter acquisitions of too faced and becca partially offset by lower net purchases of investments in connection with our cash investment strategy 

  

the fiscal 2018 change in net cash provided by used for financing activities primarily reflected the prior year issuance of the 2020 senior notes 2027 senior notes and 2047 senior notes partially offset by the repayment of the 555 senior notes due may 15 2017 the change also reflected higher treasury stock purchases lower commercial paper borrowings and higher dividend payments in the current year 

  

the fiscal 2017 increase in net cash provided by financing activities reflected the issuance of the 2020 senior notes 2027 senior notes and 2047 senior notes partially offset by the repayment of the 2017 senior notes the increase also reflected lower treasury stock purchases and higher commercial paper borrowings partially offset by higher dividend payments 

  

dividends

pension and postretirement plan funding 

  

several factors influence the annual funding requirements for our pension plans for our domestic trustbased noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan “us qualified plan” we seek to maintain appropriate funded percentages for any future contributions to the us qualified plan we would seek to contribute an amount or amounts that would not be less than the minimum required by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended “erisa” and subsequent pension legislation and would not be more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes for each international plan our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations in addition amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions    the effect of our pension plan funding on future operating results will depend on economic conditions employee demographics mortality rates the number of participants electing to take lumpsum distributions investment performance and funding decisions 

  

for the us qualified plan we maintain an investment strategy of matching the duration of a substantial portion of the plan assets with the duration of the underlying plan liabilities this strategy assists us in maintaining our overall funded ratio for fiscal 2018 and 2017 we met or exceeded all contribution requirements under erisa regulations for the us qualified plan in fiscal 2018 we made a discretionary cash contribution to the us qualified plan of 40 million as we continue to monitor the funded status we may decide to make cash contributions to the us qualified plan or our postretirement medical plan in the united states during fiscal 2019 

  

the following table summarizes actual and expected benefit payments and contributions for our other pension and postretirement plans 

  

   

commitments and contingencies 

  

certain of our business acquisition agreements include contingent consideration or “earnout” provisions these provisions generally require that we pay to the seller or sellers of the business additional amounts based on the performance of the acquired business since the size of each payment depends upon performance of the acquired business we do not expect that such payments will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or financial condition 

  

for additional contingencies refer to item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 14 – commitments and contingencies contractual obligations

for a discussion of credit risk see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 11 – derivative financial instruments credit risk  

  

market risk 

  

we address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of market risk management that includes the use of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates and to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet to perform a sensitivity analysis of our foreign currency forward contracts we assess the change in fair values from the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates a hypothetical 10 weakening of the us dollar against the foreign exchange rates for the currencies in our portfolio would have resulted in a net decrease in the fair value of our portfolio of approximately 10 million and 26 million as of june 30 2018 and 2017 respectively this potential change does not consider our underlying foreign currency exposures 

  

  

in addition we enter into interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on our aggregate liability portfolio including future debt issuances based on a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates the estimated fair value of our interest rate derivatives would decrease by approximately 24 million and 34 million as of june 30 2018 and 2017 respectively 

  

our sensitivity analysis represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may or may not occur it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated based upon actual fluctuations in market rates operating exposures and the timing thereof and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year we believe however that any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the derivative financial instrument was intended 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition at june 30 2018 and our results of operations for the three fiscal years ended june 30 2018 are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements these estimates and assumptions can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates we consider accounting estimates to be critical if both i the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and ii the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to the company’s financial condition our most critical accounting policies relate to goodwill other intangible assets and longlived assets and income taxes 

  

management of the company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of the company’s board of directors 

  

goodwill other intangible assets and longlived assets – impairment assessment 

goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets other indefinitelived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized 

  

when testing goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment we have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test for fiscal 2018 and 2017 we elected to perform the qualitative assessment for certain of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets this qualitative assessment included the review of certain macroeconomic factors and entityspecific qualitative factors to determine if it was morelikelythannot that the fair values of our reporting units were below carrying value   for our other reporting units and other indefinitelived intangible assets a quantitative assessment was performed   we engaged thirdparty valuation specialists and used industry accepted valuation models and criteria that were reviewed and approved by various levels of management

  

for further discussion of the methods used and factors considered in our estimates as part of the impairment testing for goodwill other intangible assets and longlived assets see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 2 – summary of significant accounting policies  

  

income taxes 

we calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate as the application of various tax laws relevant to our global business is often uncertain significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions the provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable for the current year the effect of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions 

  

  

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis net operating losses tax credit and other carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates when the assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled we regularly review deferred tax assets for realizability and establish valuation allowances based on available evidence including historical operating losses projected future taxable income expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and appropriate tax planning strategies if our assessment of the realizability of a deferred tax asset changes an increase to a valuation allowance will result in a reduction of net earnings at that time while the reduction of a valuation allowance will result in an increase of net earnings at that time 

  

we provide tax reserves for us federal state local and foreign tax exposures relating to periods subject to audit the development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues potential outcomes and timing and is a subjective critical estimate we assess our tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting dates for those tax positions where it is morelikelythannot that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those tax positions where it is morelikelythannot that a tax benefit will not be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements we classify applicable interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes although the outcome relating to these exposures is uncertain in our opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating from these exposures if actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates they could have a material impact on our consolidated net earnings 

  

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted the tcja which among other things lowered the us corporate statutory income tax rate and established a modified territorial system requiring a mandatory deemed repatriation tax on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries

  

in accordance with securities and exchange commission the “sec” staff accounting bulletin 118 as of june 30 2018 we recorded certain tcja related provisional charges using available information and estimates adjustments to the provisional charges will be recorded in the period in which those adjustments become reasonably estimable andor the accounting is complete such adjustments may result from among other things future guidance interpretations and regulatory changes from the us internal revenue service the sec the financial accounting standards board andor various state and local tax jurisdictions we will complete this analysis no later than december 22 2018

 item 1a risk factors 

  

there are risks associated with an investment in our securities please consider the following risks and all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k and in our subsequent filings with the securities and exchange commission “sec” our business may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial if any of the events contemplated by the following discussion of risks should occur or other risks arise or develop our business prospects financial condition and results of operations as well as the trading prices of our securities may be adversely affected 

  

the beauty business is highly competitive and if we are unable to compete effectively our results will suffer 

we face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world including multinational consumer product companies some of these competitors have greater resources than we do and others are newer companies some backed by privateequity investors competing in distribution channels where we are less represented in some cases our competitors may be able to respond to changing business and economic conditions more quickly than us competition in the beauty business is based on a variety of factors including pricing of products innovation perceived value service to the consumer promotional activities advertising special events new product introductions ecommerce and mcommerce initiatives and other activities it is difficult for us to predict the timing and scale of our competitors’ actions in these areas 

  

our ability to compete also depends on the continued strength of our brands our ability to attract and retain key talent and other personnel the efficiency of our manufacturing facilities and distribution network and our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property and those other rights used in our business our company has a wellrecognized and strong reputation that could be negatively impacted by many factors if our reputation is adversely affected our ability to attract and retain customers and consumers could be impacted in addition certain of our key retailers around the world market and sell competing brands or are owned or otherwise affiliated with companies that market and sell competing brands our inability to continue to compete effectively in key countries around the world could have an adverse impact on our business 

  

our inability to anticipate and respond to market trends and changes in consumer preferences could adversely affect our financial results 

our continued success depends on our ability to anticipate gauge and react in a timely and costeffective manner to changes in consumer tastes for skin care makeup fragrance and hair care products attitudes toward our industry and brands as well as to where and how consumers shop we must continually work to develop manufacture and market new products maintain and adapt our “hightouch” services to existing and emerging distribution channels maintain and enhance the recognition of our brands achieve a favorable mix of products successfully manage our inventories and refine our approach as to how and where we market and sell our products while we devote considerable effort and resources to shape analyze and respond to consumer preferences we recognize that consumer tastes cannot be predicted with certainty and can change rapidly the issue is compounded by the increasing use of digital and social media by consumers and the speed by which information and opinions are shared if we are unable to anticipate and respond to sudden challenges that we may face in the marketplace trends in the market for our products and changing consumer demands and sentiment our financial results will suffer in addition from time to time sales growth or profitability may be concentrated in a relatively small number of our brands channels or countries if such a situation persists or a number of brands channels or countries fail to perform as expected there could be a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

  

in key markets such as the united states we have seen a decline in retail traffic in our department store customers and certain of our freestanding stores we are seeing the emergence of strong e and mcommerce platforms both in mass and prestige distribution that are impacting our business further consolidation in the retail trade from these or other factors may result in us becoming increasingly dependent on key retailers this could result in an increased risk related to the concentration of our customers a severe adverse impact on the business operations of our customers could have a corresponding material adverse effect on us if one or more of our largest customers change their strategies including pricing or promotional activities or they or we change or terminate their relationship with us there could be a material adverse effect on our business 

  

our future success depends on our ability to achieve our longterm strategy 

achieving our longterm strategy will require investment in new capabilities brands categories distribution channels technologies and emerging and more mature geographic markets these investments may result in shortterm costs without any current revenues and therefore may be dilutive to our earnings at least in the short term in addition we may dispose of or discontinue select brands or streamline operations and incur costs or restructuring and other charges in doing so although we believe that our strategy will lead to longterm growth in revenue and profitability we may not realize in full or in part the anticipated benefits the failure to realize benefits which may be due to our inability to execute plans global or local economic conditions competition changes in the beauty industry and the other risks described herein could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

acquisitions may expose us to additional risks 

we continuously review acquisition and strategic investment opportunities that would expand our current product offerings our distribution channels increase the size and geographic scope of our operations or otherwise offer growth and operating efficiency opportunities there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate these transactions on favorable terms if required the financing for these transactions could result in an increase in our indebtedness dilute the interests of our stockholders or both the purchase price for some acquisitions may include additional amounts to be paid in cash in the future a portion of which may be contingent on the achievement of certain future operating results of the acquired business if the performance of any such acquired business exceeds such operating results then we may incur additional charges and be required to pay additional amounts 

  

acquisitions including strategic investments or alliances entail numerous risks which may include 

  

·   difficulties in integrating acquired operations or products including the loss of key employees from or customers of acquired businesses

·   diversion of management ’ s attention from our existing businesses

·   adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers

·   adverse impacts of margin and product cost structures different from those of our current mix of business and

·   risks of entering distribution channels categories or markets in which we have limited or no prior experience

  

our failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business or to achieve the longterm plan for such business as well as any other adverse consequences associated with our acquisition and investment activities could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

  

completed acquisitions typically result in additional goodwill andor an increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet we are required at least annually or as facts and circumstances exist to test goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to determine if impairment has occurred if the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the fair value of other intangible assets with indefinite lives in the period the determination is made we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

a general economic downturn or sudden disruption in business conditions may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items andor the financial strength of our customers that are retailers which could adversely affect our financial results 

the general level of consumer spending is affected by a number of factors including general economic conditions inflation interest rates energy costs and consumer confidence generally all of which are beyond our control consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower and may impact sales of our products a decline in consumer purchases of discretionary items also tends to impact our customers that are retailers we generally extend credit to a retailer based on an evaluation of its financial condition usually without requiring collateral however the financial difficulties of a retailer could cause us to curtail or eliminate business with that customer we may also assume more credit risk relating to the receivables from that retailer our inability to collect receivables from our largest customers or from a group of customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition if a retailer was to liquidate we may incur additional costs if we choose to purchase the retailer’s inventory of our products to protect brand equity 

  

  

in addition sudden disruptions in business conditions for example from events such as a pandemic or other local or global health issues conflicts around the world or as a result of a terrorist attack retaliation or similar threats or as a result of adverse weather conditions climate changes or seismic events can have a shortterm and sometimes longterm impact on consumer spending 

  

events that impact consumers’ willingness or ability to travel andor purchase our products while traveling may impact our business including travel retail a significant contributor to our overall results and our strategy to market and sell products to international travelers at their destinations 

  

a downturn in the economies of or continuing recessions in the countries where we sell our products or a sudden disruption of business conditions in those countries could adversely affect consumer confidence the financial strength of our retailers and our sales and profitability we are cautious of the continued decline in retail traffic primarily related to brickandmortar department stores in the united states as a result of the impact of shifts in consumer preferences as to where and how they shop we are also cautious of foreign currency movements and their impact on tourism which has particularly impacted certain touristdriven stores in the united states additionally we continue to monitor the effects of the macroeconomic environments in certain countries such as brazil and in the middle east the united kingdom’s anticipated exit from the european union geopolitical tensions and global security issues

  

volatility in the financial markets and a related economic downturn in key markets or markets generally throughout the world could have a material adverse effect on our business while we currently generate significant cash flows from our ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities credit markets may experience significant disruptions deterioration in global financial markets or an adverse change in our credit ratings could make future financing difficult or more expensive if any financial institutions that are parties to our undrawn revolving credit facility or other financing arrangements such as foreign exchange or interest rate hedging instruments were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us this could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain foreign currency or interest rate exposures which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

changes in laws regulations and policies that affect our business could adversely affect our financial results 

our business is subject to numerous laws regulations and policies changes in the laws regulations and policies including the interpretation or enforcement thereof that affect or will affect our business including changes in accounting standards tax laws and regulations laws and regulations relating to data privacy anticorruption advertising marketing manufacturing distribution product registration ingredients chemicals and packaging laws in europe and elsewhere relating to selective distribution environmental or climate change laws regulations or accords trade rules and customs regulations and the outcome and expense of legal or regulatory proceedings and any action we may take as a result could adversely affect our financial results 

  

we are involved and may become involved in the future in disputes and other legal or regulatory proceedings that if adversely decided or settled could adversely affect our financial results 

we are and may in the future become party to litigation other disputes or regulatory proceedings in general claims made by us or against us in litigation disputes or other proceedings can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements injunctions or damages that could significantly affect our business or financial results we are currently vigorously contesting certain of these claims however it is not possible to predict the final resolution of the litigation disputes or proceedings to which we currently are or may in the future become party to and the impact of certain of these matters on our business results of operations and financial condition could be material 

  

government reviews inquiries investigations and actions could harm our business or reputation 

as we operate in various locations around the world our operations in certain countries are subject to significant governmental scrutiny and may be adversely impacted by the results of such scrutiny the regulatory environment with regard to our business is evolving and officials often exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply applicable regulations from time to time we may receive formal and informal inquiries from various government regulatory authorities as well as selfregulatory organizations about our business and compliance with local laws regulations or standards any determination that our operations or activities or the activities of our employees are not in compliance with existing laws regulations or standards could negatively impact us in a number of ways including the imposition of substantial fines interruptions of business loss of supplier vendor or other thirdparty relationships termination of necessary licenses and permits or similar results all of which could potentially harm our business andor reputation even if an inquiry does not result in these types of determinations it potentially could create negative publicity which could harm our business andor reputation 

  

  

our success depends in part on the quality efficacy and safety of our products 

our success depends in part on the quality efficacy and safety of our products if our products are found to be defective or unsafe our product claims are found to be deceptive or our products otherwise fail to meet our consumers’ expectations our relationships with customers or consumers could suffer the appeal of one or more of our brands could be diminished and we could lose sales andor become subject to liability or claims any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition third parties may sell counterfeit versions of some of our products these counterfeit products may pose safety risks may fail to meet consumers’ expectations and may have a negative impact on our reputation 

  

our success depends in part on our key personnel 

our success depends in part on our ability to retain our key personnel including our executive officers and senior management team the unexpected loss of one or more of our key employees could adversely affect our business our success also depends in part on our continuing ability to identify hire train and retain other highly qualified personnel competition for these employees can be intense we may not be able to attract assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business this risk may be exacerbated by the stresses associated with the implementation of our strategic plan and other initiatives 

  

we are subject to risks related to the global scope of our operations 

we operate on a global basis with a majority of our fiscal 2017 net sales and operating income generated outside the united states we intend to reinvest these earnings in our foreign operations indefinitely except where we are able to repatriate these earnings to the united states without material incremental tax provision a majority of our cash and cash equivalents that result from these earnings remain outside the united states if these indefinitely reinvested earnings were repatriated into the united states as dividends we would be subject to additional taxes 

  

we maintain offices in over 50 countries and have key operational facilities located inside and outside the united states that manufacture warehouse or distribute goods for sale throughout the world our global operations are subject to many risks and uncertainties including 

  

·   fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and the relative costs of operating in different places which can affect our results of operations the value of our foreign assets the relative prices at which we and competitors sell products in the same markets the cost of certain inventory and noninventory items required in our operations and the relative prices at which we sell our products in different markets

  

·   foreign or us laws regulations and policies including restrictions on trade immigration and travel import and export license requirements tariffs and taxes operations and investments

  

·   lack of wellestablished or reliable legal and administrative systems in certain countries in which we operate and

  

·   adverse weather conditions currency exchange controls and social economic and geopolitical conditions such as terrorist attacks war or other military action

  

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects reputation results of operations and financial condition 

  

a disruption in operations or our supply chain could adversely affect our business and financial results 

as a company engaged in manufacturing and distribution on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including industrial accidents environmental events strikes and other labor disputes disruptions in supply chain or information systems loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites or suppliers product quality control safety increase in commodity prices and energy costs licensing requirements and other regulatory issues as well as natural disasters and other external factors over which we have no control if such an event were to occur it could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

  

we use a wide variety of direct and indirect suppliers of goods and services from around the world some of our products rely on single or a limited number of suppliers changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers could subject us to losses or adversely affect our ability to bring products to market further the failure of our suppliers to deliver goods and services in sufficient quantities in compliance with applicable standards and in a timely manner could adversely affect our customer service levels and overall business in addition any increases in the costs of goods and services for our business may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies in our operations 

  

  

our information systems and websites may be susceptible to cybersecurity breaches outages and other risks 

we rely on information systems outsourced and inhouse that support our business processes including product development marketing sales order processing production distribution finance and intracompany communications throughout the world we have ecommerce mcommerce and other internet websites in the united states and many other countries these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire floods power loss telecommunications failures breakins and other events despite the implementation of network security measures our systems may be vulnerable to cybersecurity breaches such as computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering the occurrence of these or other events could disrupt or damage our information systems and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

failure to adequately maintain the security of our electronic and other confidential information could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we are dependent upon automated information technology processes as part of our normal business activities we collect and store certain information that is confidential proprietary or otherwise sensitive including personal information with respect to customers consumers and employees we may share some of this information with vendors who assist us with certain aspects of our business moreover the success of our ecommerce and mcommerce operations depends upon the secure transmission of confidential and personal data over public networks including the use of cashless payments any failure on the part of us or our vendors to maintain the security of our confidential data and personal information including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information could result in business disruption damage to our reputation financial obligations to third parties fines penalties regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs and also result in deterioration in our employees’ consumers’ and customers’ confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages and thus could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to enhance our information security systems and could result in a disruption to our operations 

  

we are subject to risks associated with our global information systems 

our implementation and maintenance of global information systems outsourced and inhouse including supply chain and finance systems human resource management systems creative asset management and retail operating systems as well as associated hardware and use of cloudbased models involve risks and uncertainties failure to implement and maintain these and other systems as planned in terms of timing specifications costs or otherwise could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

  

as we outsource functions we become more dependent on the entities performing those functions 

as part of our longterm strategy we are continually looking for opportunities to provide essential business services in a more costeffective manner in some cases this requires the outsourcing of functions or parts of functions that can be performed more effectively by external service providers these include certain information systems finance and human resource functions while we believe we conduct appropriate due diligence before entering into agreements with the outsourcing entity the failure of one or more entities to provide the expected services provide them on a timely basis or to provide them at the prices we expect may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition in addition if we transition systems to one or more new or among existing external service providers we may experience challenges that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

  

the trading prices of our securities periodically may rise or fall based on the accuracy of predictions of our earnings or other financial performance 

our business planning process is designed to maximize our longterm strength growth and profitability not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter we believe that this longerterm focus is in the best interests of the company and our stockholders at the same time however we recognize that it may be helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our forecast of net sales earnings per share and other financial metrics or projections accordingly when we announced our yearend financial results for fiscal 2017 we provided guidance as to certain assumptions including ranges for our expected net sales and earnings per share for the quarter ending september 30 2017 and the fiscal year ending june 30 2018 while we generally expect to provide updates to our guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter we assume no responsibility to update any of our forwardlooking statements at such times or otherwise in addition the longerterm guidance we provide is based on goals that we believe at the time guidance is given are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years such targets are more difficult to predict than our current quarter and fiscal year expectations we historically have paid dividends on our common stock and repurchased shares of our class a common stock at any time we could stop or suspend payment of dividends or stop or suspend our stock repurchase program and any such action could cause the market price of our stock to decline 

  

  

in all of our public statements when we make or update a forwardlooking statement about our net sales andor earnings expectations or expectations regarding restructuring or other initiatives we accompany such statements directly or by reference to a public document with a list of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we expect such a list is included among other places in our earnings press release and in our periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission eg in our reports on form 10k and form 10q these and other factors may make it difficult for us and for outside observers such as research analysts to predict what our earnings will be in any given fiscal quarter or year 

  

outside analysts and investors have the right to make their own predictions of our financial results for any future period outside analysts however have access to no more material information about our results or plans than any other public investor and we do not endorse their predictions as to our future performance nor do we assume any responsibility to correct the predictions of outside analysts or others when they differ from our own internal expectations if and when we announce actual results that differ from those that outside analysts or others have been predicting the market price of our securities could be affected investors who rely on the predictions of outside analysts or others when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk we take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in the prices of our securities 

  

we are controlled by the lauder family as a result of their control of us the lauder family has the ability to prevent or cause a change in control or approve prevent or influence certain actions by us 

  

as of august 18 2017 members of the lauder family beneficially own directly or indirectly shares of the company’s class a common stock with one vote per share and class b common stock with 10 votes per share having approximately 87 of the outstanding voting power of the common stock in addition there are four members of the lauder family who are employees and members of our board of directors another family member is a party to a consulting agreement and a license agreement with us 

  

as a result of the stock ownership and their positions at the company the lauder family has the ability to exercise significant control and influence over our business including all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors amendments to the certificate of incorporation and significant corporate transactions such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets for the foreseeable future

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

  

results of operations 

we manufacture market and sell beauty products including those in the skin care makeup fragrance and hair care categories which are distributed in over 150 countries and territories the following table is a comparative summary of operating results for fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 and reflects the basis of presentation described in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 2 – summary of significant accounting policies and note 21 – segment data and related information for all periods presented products and services that do not meet our definition of skin care makeup fragrance and hair care have been included in the “other” category 

  

   

  

the following table presents certain consolidated earnings data as a percentage of net sales 

  

   

in order to meet the demands of consumers we continually introduce new products support new and established products through advertising merchandising and sampling and phase out existing products that no longer meet the needs of our consumers or our objectives the economics of developing producing launching supporting and discontinuing products impact our sales and operating performance each period the introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products which we take into account in our business planning 

  

nongaap financial measures 

  

we use certain nongaap financial measures among other financial measures to evaluate our operating performance which represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business management believes that excluding certain items that are not comparable from period to period helps investors and others compare operating performance between periods while we consider the nongaap measures useful in analyzing our results they are not intended to replace or act as a substitute for any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with us gaap see reconciliations of nongaap financial measures beginning on page 41 for reconciliations between nongaap financial measures and the most directly comparable us gaap measures

  

we operate on a global basis with the majority of our net sales generated outside the united states accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our results of operations therefore we present certain net sales operating results and diluted net earnings per common share information excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations to provide a framework for assessing the performance of our underlying business outside the united states constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant periodoverperiod we calculate constant currency information by translating current year results using prior year weightedaverage foreign currency exchange rates 

  

overview 

  

we believe the best way to increase stockholder value is to continue to provide superior products and services in the most efficient and effective manner while recognizing consumers’ changing behaviors and shopping preferences we are guided by our longterm strategy which has numerous initiatives across geographic regions product categories brands channels of distribution and functions that are designed to grow our sales provide cost efficiencies leverage our strengths and make us more productive and profitable   we plan to build upon and leverage our history of outstanding creativity and innovation high quality products and services and engaging communications while investing for longterm sustainable growth 

  

  

our balanced diverse and highly desirable brand portfolio positions us well to capitalize on opportunities in fast growing and profitable areas of prestige beauty  we believe that our range of prestige product offerings allows us to increase our share of a consumer’s beauty routine and source consumers from brands sold in massmarket distribution 

  

·   our skin care product category benefits from hero product lines such as advanced night repair from estée lauder and crème de la mer from la mer during fiscal 2017 we continued to expand these product lines through the introduction of the advanced night repair eye concentrate matrix from estée lauder and the revitalizing hydrating serum from la mer glamglow also contributed to the success in the category through targeted expanded consumer reach and new launches such as plumprageous in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 we purchased a minority interest in deciem a skin care brand which provides us with a strategic investment in a company that attracts millennials and a diverse consumer base

  

·   in our makeup category we further developed hero product lines such as double wear and pure color envy from estée lauder through the launch of additional products including double wear nude cushion stick radiant makeup and pure color envy hilustre light sculpting lipstick we continuously look to acquire brands that complement our existing business have significant sales growth potential and provide opportunities for future profitable growth during our fiscal 2017 second quarter we expanded our makeup portfolio with the acquisitions of too faced and becca both of these brands are primarily distributed in the faster growing specialtymulti and online channels they are expected to help us reach new consumers to increase our sales in these channels and to continue generating strong profitable growth

  

·   our fragrance category continues to benefit from increased sales of jo malone london and tom ford fragrances as well as from our fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016 acquisitions we have also benefited from the growth of the fragrance category in the asiapacific region and look for further opportunities to strengthen our business in this category there

  

·   in our hair care category we are reaching new consumers as we expand our presence beyond salons such as the planned september 2017 launch of bumble and bumble in ulta beauty a leading specialtymulti retailer in the united states

  

our global footprint provides many avenues of growth we leverage our regional organizations and the talents and expertise of our people to continue to be locally relevant through evolving the way we connect with our consumers in stores online and where they travel this includes the expansion of our digital and social media presence and the engagement of global and local influencers to amplify brand or product stories we tailor our strategy by country with our products services channels marketing and visual merchandising we continuously strengthen our presence in large imagebuilding core markets such as the united states and the united kingdom and broaden our presence in emerging markets including the middle east russia south africa and brazil

  

·   in north america we continue to deploy a number of strategies to accelerate growth despite a challenging environment especially in brick and mortar department stores and in latin america we continue to launch new brands expand the integration of social media and gain share in prestige beauty by encouraging consumers to trade up from massmarket products

  

·   in europe the middle east  africa we are expanding our digital and social media presence as well as leveraging our makeup strength to gain share in prestige beauty

  

·   in asiapacific particularly in china we are leveraging our diversified brand portfolio to benefit from the growth of the makeup and fragrance categories as well as continuing to launch new skin care products such as the clinique fresh pressed line of products with vitamin c

  

we approach distribution strategically by brand distribution channel and product category we are adding brands to faster growing channels such as e and mcommerce and specialty multibrand retailers and we are expanding certain brands into geographic markets where they are not yet sold 

  

·   in fiscal 2017 we increased our penetration in the specialtymulti channel through the acquisitions of becca and too faced and we expanded the representation of our existing brands such as the launch of m ž a ž c in ulta beauty in addition we have opportunities to accelerate our growth within specialtymulti brand retailers as they open new doors

  

·   internationally we are expanding our business in freestanding retail stores operated by us and by authorized third parties in european perfumeries and pharmacies and in department stores particularly in the united kingdom and certain markets in asia 

  

·   we seek to optimize distribution in both channels and geographies matching each brand with appropriate opportunities while maintaining high productivity per door we focus on brandbuilding retail opportunities that will expand consumer coverage for our brands as part of this strategy we continue to diversify our business in our travel retail channel across brands and product categories travel retail continues to be an important channel for brand building and profit margin expansion at the same time it is susceptible to a number of external factors including fluctuations in currency exchange rates and consumers’ willingness and ability to travel and spend 

  

  

·   online net sales continue to grow strongly on a global basis and we are continuing to launch e and mcommerce sites in new and existing markets we are also partnering with our retailers globally to drive sales of our products on their online sites we believe our success in delivering particularly strong online growth is a result of customization of our strategy to meet local market needs we also continue to develop and implement omnichannel concepts to deliver an integrated consumer experience and better serve consumers as they shop across channels

  

while our business is performing well overall we continue to face strong competition globally and economic challenges in certain countries in particular we are cautious of the continued decline in retail traffic primarily related to brickandmortar department stores in the united states as a result of the impact of shifts in consumer preferences as to where and how they shop we are also cautious of foreign currency movements including their impact on tourism which has particularly impacted certain touristdriven stores in the united states additionally we continue to monitor the effects of the macroeconomic environments in certain countries such as brazil and in the middle east the united kingdom’s anticipated exit from the european union geopolitical tensions and global security issues 

  

we believe we can to some extent offset the impact of these challenges by accelerating areas of strength among our brands product categories channels and markets however if economic conditions or the degree of uncertainty or volatility worsen or the adverse conditions previously described are further prolonged there could be a negative effect on consumer confidence demand and spending and as a result on our business we will continue to monitor these and other risks that may affect our business 

  

we navigate through shortterm volatility while focusing on our longterm strategy and using our multiple engines of growth that we believe will help promote sustainable results we are increasing our presence in emerging markets continuing efforts to revitalize and accelerate growth in our heritage brands focusing on key demographics and seeking opportunities to add to our diverse brand portfolio we are also strengthening our consumer engagement by leveraging digital marketing and enhancing our social media strategies and execution we will continue to drive product packaging and conceptual innovation and creativity that we believe enable us to introduce products that resonate with consumers some initiatives will involve new subcategories and others may expand key franchises 

  

leading beauty forward 

  

in may 2016 we announced a multiyear initiative “leading beauty forward” to build on our strengths and better leverage our cost structure to free resources for investment to continue our growth momentum leading beauty forward is designed to enhance our gotomarket capabilities reinforce our leadership in global prestige beauty and continue creating sustainable value we plan to approve specific initiatives under leading beauty forward through fiscal 2019 related to the optimization of select corporate functions supply chain activities and corporate and regional market support structures as well as the exit of underperforming businesses and expect to complete those initiatives through fiscal 2021 inclusive of charges recorded from inception through june 30 2017 we expect that leading beauty forward will result in related restructuring and other charges totaling between 600 million and 700 million before taxes consisting of employeerelated costs asset writeoffs and other costs to implement these initiatives after its full implementation we expect leading beauty forward to yield annual net benefits primarily in selling general and administrative expenses of between 200 million and 300 million before taxes we expect to reinvest a portion of these savings in future growth initiatives for additional information about leading beauty forward see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data — note 8 – charges associated with restructuring and other activities  

  

global technology infrastructure 

  

in october 2015 we approved plans to transform and modernize our global technology infrastructure “gti” to fundamentally change the way we deliver information technology services internally such initiative the “gti restructuring” as part of the gti restructuring we transitioned our gti from companyowned assets to a primarily vendorowned cloudbased model where we pay for services as they are used the implementation of the gti restructuring was substantially completed during fiscal 2016 for additional information about the gti restructuring see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 8 – charges associated with restructuring and other activities 

  

  

strategic modernization initiative implementation 

  

we rolled out the last major wave of our strategic modernization initiative “smi” in july 2014 and most of our locations are now sapenabled we plan to continue the implementation of sap at our remaining locations throughout the next few fiscal years in connection with the july 2014 implementation some retailers accelerated their sales orders that would have occurred in our fiscal 2015 first quarter into our fiscal 2014 fourth quarter in advance of this implementation to provide adequate safety stock to mitigate any potential shortterm business interruption associated with the smi rollout the negative impact on the net sales and operating results for the year ended june 30 2015 by product category and geographic region was as follows 

  

   

the lower orders during the year ended june 30 2015 created a favorable comparison between fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 of approximately 178 million in net sales and approximately 127 million in operating results and impacted our operating margin comparisons we believe that the presentation of certain yeartodate comparative information in the following discussions that excludes the impact of the timing of these orders is useful in analyzing the net sales performance and operating results of our business 

  

fiscal 2017 annual impairment testing 

  

we assess goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets at least annually for impairment or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist based on our annual goodwill and other intangible asset impairment testing as of april 1 2017 we determined that the carrying values of the rodin olio lusso and editions de parfums frédéric malle reporting units exceeded their fair values this determination was made based on updated longterm plans finalized and approved in june 2017 that reflected lower sales growth projections due to a softer than expected retail environment for those brands as a result a step 2 impairment assessment was performed and we recorded an impairment charge of the goodwill related to these reporting units of 28 million the fair values of the reporting units were based upon the average of the income approach which utilizes estimated cash flows and a terminal value discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of cash flows and the market approach which utilizes performance multiples based on market peers as of june 30 2017 no goodwill remained related to the rodin olio lusso reporting unit and the remaining carrying value of the goodwill related to the editions de parfums frédéric malle reporting unit was 6 million

  

we also determined that the carrying values of the rodin olio lusso and editions de parfums frédéric malle trademarks as well as the rodin olio lusso persona and customer relationship intangible assets exceeded their estimated fair values the fair values of the trademarks were determined utilizing a royalty rate to determine discounted projected future cash flows as a result we recognized impairment charges of 3 million for the remaining carrying values of the rodin olio lusso trademark customer relationship and persona intangible assets we also recognized an impairment charge for the editions de parfums frédéric malle trademark which was de minimis the remaining carrying value of this trademark was 32 million as of june 30 2017

  

the combined goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of 9 million and 22 million are reflected in the skin care and fragrance product categories respectively and 17 million and 14 million are reflected in the americas and europe the middle east  africa regions respectively 

  

  

if the softness in the retail environment impacting our growth projections for the editions de parfums frédéric malle reporting unit is more severe than we have anticipated or other business disruptions arise a resulting change in the longterm plans could have a negative impact on the estimated fair values of the related goodwill and trademark and it is possible we could recognize an impairment charge in the future based on the latest quantitative assessment the fair values of all other reporting units with material goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets with the exception of our fiscal 2017 acquisitions of too faced and becca were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values with regard to too faced and becca the carrying values of the related goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets as of the assessment date approximated their fair values

reported net sales in fiscal 2016 grew in each product category with the exception of skin care and in each geographic region with the exception of asiapacific the overall decline in the skin care category was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and the relatively slow growth in global prestige skin care that particularly impacted net sales in north america asiapacific and travel retail however this category benefited from increased sales of certain products particularly from la mer and origins net sales increases in product offerings by m ž a ž c smashbox tom ford clinique bobbi brown and estée lauder globally drove the growth in the makeup category our fragrance category benefited from net sales increases from our luxury brands incremental sales from our acquisitions during fiscal 2016 and 2015 also helped drive our skin care and fragrance sales the net sales increase in our hair care category was driven by product offerings from aveda and bumble and bumble as well as expanded consumer coverage each of our product categories benefited from targeted expanded consumer reach comparable door sales growth from certain brands new product offerings and growth from emerging markets

fiscal 2016 as compared with fiscal 2015 

  

the lower advertising merchandising and sampling costs in fiscal 2016 as a percentage of net sales as compared to fiscal 2015 were in part due to the brand and channel mix of our spend as certain media formats carry different cost structures certain of our brands have lower costs associated with advertising as they focus on digital and social media strategies and rely less on print and television advertising which carry a higher media cost

provision for income taxes 

  

   

the effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 decreased approximately 460 basis points due to the reversal of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance the “china deferred tax asset valuation allowance reversal” the deferred tax asset and associated valuation allowance related to the accumulated carryforward of excess advertising and promotional expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 a favorable change to the tax law in china was enacted that expanded the corporate income tax deduction allowance for advertising and promotional expenses resulting in this change in realizability of the asset also contributing to this decrease was a reduction in income tax reserve adjustments of approximately 100 basis points 

  

the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2016 was principally attributable to a lower effective tax rate related to our foreign operations as well as a decrease in income tax reserve adjustments recorded in fiscal 2016 

  

the provision for income taxes represents us federal foreign state and local income taxes the effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state and local income taxes the taxation of foreign income and income tax reserve adjustments which represent changes in our net liability for unrecognized tax benefits including tax settlements and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations our effective tax rate will change from quarter to quarter based on recurring and nonrecurring factors including but not limited to the geographical mix of earnings enacted tax legislation state and local income taxes tax reserve adjustments the ultimate disposition of deferred tax assets relating to stockbased compensation and the interaction of various global tax strategies in addition changes in judgment from the evaluation of new information resulting in the recognition derecognition or remeasurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period are recognized separately in the quarter of change

financial condition 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

overview 

  

our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program borrowings from the issuance of longterm debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks and other lenders in the united states and abroad at june 30 2017 we had cash and cash equivalents of 1136 million compared with 914 million at june 30 2016   our cash and cash equivalents are maintained at a number of financial institutions to mitigate the risk of uninsured balances we select financial institutions based on their credit ratings and financial strength and we perform ongoing evaluations of these institutions to limit our concentration risk exposure 

  

in addition we purchase short and longterm investments pursuant to our cash investment strategy our investment objectives include capital preservation maintaining adequate liquidity asset diversification and achieving appropriate returns within the guidelines set forth in our investment policy these investments are classified as availableforsale and totaled 1498 million and 1505 million at june 30 2017 and 2016 respectively 

  

our business is seasonal in nature and accordingly our working capital needs vary from time to time we may enter into investing and financing transactions that require additional funding to the extent that these needs exceed cash from operations we could subject to market conditions issue commercial paper issue longterm debt securities or borrow under our revolving credit facilities 

  

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that cash on hand cash generated from operations available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business operations information systems enhancements capital expenditures potential stock repurchases restructuring initiatives commitments and other contractual obligations on both a nearterm and longterm basis our cash and cash equivalents and short and longterm investment balances at june 30 2017 include 2376 million of cash and short and longterm investments in offshore jurisdictions associated with our permanent reinvestment strategy we do not believe that the indefinite reinvestment of these funds offshore impairs our ability to meet our domestic debt or working capital obligations if these indefinitely reinvested earnings were repatriated into the united states as dividends we would be subject to additional taxes 

  

the effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years generally we have been able to introduce new products at higher prices increase prices and implement other operating efficiencies to sufficiently offset cost increases which have been moderate 

  

credit ratings 

  

changes in our credit ratings will likely result in changes in our borrowing costs our credit ratings also impact the cost of our revolving credit facility downgrades in our credit ratings may reduce our ability to issue commercial paper andor longterm debt and would likely increase the relative costs of borrowing a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating or information as of august 18 2017 our commercial paper is rated a1 by standard  poor’s and p1 by moody’s and our longterm debt is rated a with a stable outlook by standard  poor’s and a2 with a stable outlook by moody’s 

  

debt and access to liquidity 

  

total debt as a percent of total capitalization excluding noncontrolling interests increased to 45 at june 30 2017 from 39 at june 30 2016 primarily due to the february 2017 issuance of the 180 senior notes due february 7 2020 “2020 senior notes” 315 senior notes due march 15 2027 “2027 senior notes” and 415 senior notes due march 15 2047 “2047 senior notes” 

  

for further information regarding our current and longterm debt and available financing see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 11 – debt  

  

cash flows 

  

   

  

the fiscal 2017 increase in net cash provided by operating activities as compared with fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by an increase in net earnings a decrease in discretionary pension and postretirement benefit contributions and a favorable change in accounts receivable due to the timing of shipments and collections these improvements were partially offset by unfavorable changes in accounts payable primarily due to the timing of payments and other accrued and noncurrent liabilities related to a change in legal accruals accrued professional fees and accrued employee incentive compensation partially offset by advertising and promotional accruals the overall change in cash flows from certain working capital components was impacted by our fiscal 2017 acquisitions 

  

the fiscal 2016 decrease in net cash provided by operating activities as compared with fiscal 2015 was primarily driven by the accelerated orders in connection with our july 2014 smi implementation which contributed to an unfavorable comparison in certain working capital components and the increase in net earnings the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities also reflected an unfavorable change in accounts receivable reflecting the timing of shipments and collections and higher longterm payments related to new freestanding retail store locations including cash payments made to former tenants to acquire the rights under commercial property leases also contributing to the decrease was an unfavorable change in accounts payable primarily due to the timing of expenses these decreases were partially offset by an increase in other accrued liabilities due in part to higher accrued restructuring costs and employee incentive compensation 

  

the fiscal 2017 increase in net cash used for investing activities primarily reflected cash paid in connection with the fiscal 2017 second quarter acquisitions of too faced and becca partially offset by lower net purchases of investments in connection with our cash investment strategy 

  

the fiscal 2016 decrease in net cash used for investing activities as compared with fiscal 2015 primarily reflected lower net purchases of investments in connection with our cash investment strategy the decrease in cash used for investing activities also reflected lower payments related to acquisitions cash paid in connection with the fiscal 2015 acquisitions was partially offset by cash paid in connection with the fiscal 2016 acquisition of by kilian and an additional purchase price trueup payment related to a fiscal 2015 acquisition partially offsetting the decrease was cash paid in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 for the longterm investment in have  be co ltd the company behind the skin care brands dr jart  and do the right thing as well as higher capital expenditure activity primarily related to leasehold improvements 

  

the fiscal 2017 increase in net cash provided by financing activities reflected the issuance of the 2020 senior notes 2027 senior notes and 2047 senior notes partially offset by the repayment of the 555 senior notes due may 15 2017 the increase also reflected lower treasury stock purchases and higher commercial paper borrowings partially offset by higher dividend payments 

  

the fiscal 2016 decrease in net cash used for financing activities as compared with fiscal 2015 primarily reflected the proceeds from the issuance of the 170 senior notes due may 10 2021 and additional 4375 senior notes due june 15 2045 as well as lower treasury stock purchases partially offset by higher dividend payments 

  

dividends

pension and postretirement plan funding 

  

several factors influence the annual funding requirements for our pension plans for our domestic trustbased noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan “us qualified plan” we seek to maintain appropriate funded percentages for any future contributions to the us qualified plan we would seek to contribute an amount or amounts that would not be less than the minimum required by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended “erisa” and subsequent pension legislation and would not be more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes for each international plan our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations in addition amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions as detailed in critical accounting policies and estimates   the effect of our pension plan funding on future operating results will depend on economic conditions employee demographics mortality rates the number of participants electing to take lumpsum distributions investment performance and funding decisions 

  

for the us qualified plan we maintain an investment strategy of matching the duration of a substantial portion of the plan assets with the duration of the underlying plan liabilities this strategy assists us in maintaining our overall funded ratio for fiscal 2017 and 2016 we met or exceeded all contribution requirements under erisa regulations for the us qualified plan in fiscal 2016 we made a discretionary cash contribution to the us qualified plan of 30 million as we continue to monitor the funded status we may decide to make cash contributions to the us qualified plan or our postretirement medical plan in the united states during fiscal 2018 

  

  

the following table summarizes actual and expected benefit payments and contributions for our other pension and postretirement plans 

  

   

commitments and contingencies 

  

certain of our business acquisition agreements include contingent consideration or “earnout” provisions these provisions generally require that we pay to the seller or sellers of the business additional amounts based on the performance of the acquired business since the size of each payment depends upon performance of the acquired business we do not expect that such payments will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or financial condition 

  

for additional contingencies refer to item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 15 – commitments and contingencies contractual obligations

for a discussion of credit risk see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 12 – derivative financial instruments credit risk  

  

market risk 

  

during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 we changed our market risk assessment model from a valueatrisk model to a sensitivity based model this sensitivity analysis utilizes hypothetical changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates at the end of the reporting period to express the potential future losses for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors we believe this model provides greater insight into the impact of market risk exposures on our derivative instruments 

  

we address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of market risk management that includes the use of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates and to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet to perform a sensitivity analysis of our foreign currency forward contracts we assess the change in fair values from the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates a hypothetical 10 weakening of the us dollar against the foreign exchange rates for the currencies in our portfolio would have resulted in a net decrease in the fair value of our portfolio of approximately 26 million and 22 million as of june 30 2017 and 2016 respectively this potential change does not consider our underlying foreign currency exposures 

  

in addition we enter into interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on our aggregate liability portfolio including future debt issuances based on a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates the estimated fair value of our interest rate derivatives would decrease by 34 million and 15 million as of june 30 2017 and 2016 respectively 

  

our sensitivity analysis represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may or may not occur it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated based upon actual fluctuations in market rates operating exposures and the timing thereof and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year we believe however that any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the derivative financial instrument was intended 

  

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

we do not maintain any offbalance sheet arrangements transactions obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities other than operating leases that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition at june 30 2017 and our results of operations for the three fiscal years ended june 30 2017 are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements these estimates and assumptions can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates we consider accounting estimates to be critical if both i the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and ii the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to the company’s financial condition our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition inventory pension and other postretirement benefit costs goodwill other intangible assets and longlived assets and income taxes 

  

management of the company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of the company’s board of directors 

  

revenue recognition 

our sales return accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net sales this accrual is calculated based on a history of actual returns estimated future returns and information provided by retailers regarding their inventory levels consideration of these factors results in an accrual for anticipated sales returns that reflects increases or decreases related to seasonal fluctuations experience has shown a relationship between retailer inventory levels and sales returns in the subsequent period as well as a consistent pattern of returns due to the seasonal nature of our business in addition as necessary specific accruals may be established for significant future known or anticipated events the types of known or anticipated events that we have considered and will continue to consider include but are not limited to the financial condition of our customers store closings by retailers changes in the retail environment and our decision to continue to support new and existing products

  

for a discussion of our revenue recognition accounting policy which includes information about the sales return accrual see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 2 – summary of significant accounting policies  

  

inventory 

we state our inventory at the lower of cost or fairmarket value with cost being based on standard cost and production variances which approximate actual cost on the firstin firstout method we believe this method most closely matches the flow of our products from manufacture through sale the reported net value of our inventory includes saleable products promotional products raw materials and componentry and work in process that will be sold or used in future periods 

  

we also record an inventory obsolescence reserve which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated realizable value based on various product sales projections this reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales in addition and as necessary we may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events 

  

for further discussion of our inventory accounting policy see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 2 – summary of significant accounting policies  

  

pension and other postretirement benefit costs 

we offer the following benefits to some or all of our employees the us qualified plan and an unfunded nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations collectively with the us qualified plan the “domestic plans” a domestic contributory defined contribution plan international pension plans which vary by country consisting of both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans deferred compensation arrangements and certain other postretirement benefit plans 

  

the amounts needed to fund future payouts under our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans are subject to numerous assumptions such as an anticipated discount rate expected rate of return on plan assets mortality rates and future compensation levels we evaluate these assumptions with our actuarial advisors and select assumptions that we believe reflect the economics underlying our pension and postretirement obligations while we believe these assumptions are within accepted industry ranges an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a direct impact on reported net earnings 

  

  

the discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated longterm bonds for fiscal 2017 net periodic benefit cost was determined using discount rates for our domestic plans of 370 and 300 and varying rates on our international plans between 25 and 600 the discount rates for our domestic plans were based on a bond portfolio that includes only longterm bonds with an aa rating or equivalent from a major rating agency we used an abovemean yield curve which represents an estimate of the effective settlement rate of the obligation and the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio are expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of our domestic plans for our international plans the discount rate in a particular country was principally determined based on a yield curve constructed from high quality corporate bonds in each country with the resulting portfolio having a duration matching that particular plan 

  

for fiscal 2017 we used an expected return on plan assets of 700 for our us qualified plan and varying rates of between 150 and 600 for our international plans in determining the longterm rate of return for a plan we consider the historical rates of return the nature of the plan’s investments and an expectation for the plan’s investment strategies see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 14 – pension deferred compensation and postretirement benefit plans for details regarding the nature of our pension and postretirement plan investments the difference between actual and expected return on plan assets is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income those gainslosses that are subject to amortization over future periods will be recognized as a component of the net periodic benefit cost in such future periods for fiscal 2017 our pension plans had actual return on assets of approximately 99 million as compared with expected return on assets of approximately 68 million the resulting net deferred gain of approximately 31 million when combined with gains and losses from previous years will be amortized over periods ranging from approximately 7 to 19 years the actual return on plan assets from our global pension plans was higher than expected due to the strong performance of equity assets globally and enhanced by fixed income returns in the united kingdom plan 

a 25 basispoint change in the discount rate or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have had the following effect on fiscal 2017 pension expense 

  

   

our postretirement plans are comprised of health care plans that could be impacted by health care cost trend rates which may have a significant effect on the amounts reported a 100 basispoint change in assumed health care cost trend rates for fiscal 2017 would have had the following effects 

  

   

to determine the fiscal 2018 net periodic benefit cost we are using discount rates of 390 and 340 for the us qualified plan and the nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan respectively and varying rates for our international plans of between 50 and 675 we are using an expected return on plan assets of 700 for the us qualified plan and varying rates for our international pension plans of between 175 and 675 the net change in these two key assumptions from those used in fiscal 2017 will result in a decrease in pension expense of approximately 1 million in fiscal 2018 

  

goodwill other intangible assets and longlived assets 

goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets other indefinitelived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized 

  

when testing goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment we have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test for fiscal 2017 and 2016 we elected to perform the qualitative assessment for certain of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets this qualitative assessment included the review of certain macroeconomic factors and entityspecific qualitative factors to determine if it was morelikelythannot that the fair values of our reporting units were below carrying value for our other reporting units and other indefinitelived intangible assets including those acquired during and subsequent to fiscal 2015 a quantitative assessment was performed   we engaged thirdparty valuation specialists and used industry accepted valuation models and criteria that were reviewed and approved by various levels of management with regard to our fiscal 2017 acquisitions of becca and too faced the carrying values of the related goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets as of the assessment date approximated their fair values 

  

  

for further discussion of the methods used and factors considered in our estimates as part of the impairment testing for goodwill other intangible assets and longlived assets see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 2 – summary of significant accounting policies  

  

income taxes 

we account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns as of june 30 2017 we have net deferred tax assets of 322 million the net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization as well as the continued application of currently anticipated tax rates included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance of 42 million for deferred tax assets where management believes it is morelikelythannot that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the relevant jurisdiction 

  

we provide tax reserves for us federal state local and foreign exposures relating to periods subject to audit the development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues potential outcomes and timing and is a subjective critical estimate we assess our tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting dates 

  

for further discussion of our income taxes accounting policy see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 2 – summary of significant accounting policies  

  

quantitative analysis 

during the threeyear period ended june 30 2017 there have not been material changes in the assumptions underlying these critical accounting policies nor to the related significant estimates the results of our business underlying these assumptions have not differed significantly from our expectations 

  

while we believe that the estimates that we have made are proper and the related results of operations for the period are presented fairly in all material respects other assumptions could reasonably be justified that would change the amount of reported net sales cost of sales or our provision for income taxes as they relate to the provisions for anticipated sales returns inventory obsolescence reserve and income taxes 

  

a 250 basispoint change in the items above collectively would have had the following effects for fiscal 2017

 item 1a risk factors 

  

there are risks associated with an investment in our securities please consider the following risks and all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k and in our subsequent filings with the securities and exchange commission “sec” our business may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial if any of the events contemplated by the following discussion of risks should occur or other risks arise or develop our business prospects financial condition and results of operations as well as the trading prices of our securities may be adversely affected 

  

the beauty business is highly competitive and if we are unable to compete effectively our results will suffer 

we face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world including multinational consumer product companies some of these competitors have greater resources than we do and others are new companies competing in emerging distribution channels in some cases our competitors may be able to respond to changing business and economic conditions more quickly than us competition in the beauty business is based on pricing of products innovation perceived value service to the consumer promotional activities advertising special events new product introductions ecommerce and mcommerce initiatives and other activities it is difficult for us to predict the timing and scale of our competitors’ actions in these areas a consolidation in the retail trade may result in us becoming increasingly dependent on key retailers this could result in an increased risk related to the concentration of our customers a severe adverse impact on the business operations of our customers could have a corresponding material adverse effect on us if one or more of our largest customers change their strategies including pricing or promotional activities or change or terminate their relationship with us there could be a material adverse effect on our business 

  

our ability to compete also depends on the continued strength of our brands our ability to attract and retain key talent and other personnel the efficiency of our manufacturing facilities and distribution network and our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property and those other rights used in our business our company has a wellrecognized and strong reputation that could be negatively impacted by many factors if the company’s reputation is adversely affected its ability to attract and retain customers and consumers could be impacted in addition certain of our key retailers around the world market and sell competing brands or are owned or otherwise affiliated with companies that market and sell competing brands our inability to continue to compete effectively in key countries around the world could have an adverse impact on our business 

  

our inability to anticipate and respond to market trends and changes in consumer preferences could adversely affect our financial results 

our continued success depends on our ability to anticipate gauge and react in a timely and costeffective manner to changes in consumer tastes for skin care makeup fragrance and hair care products attitudes toward our industry and brands as well as to where and how consumers shop for those products we must continually work to develop manufacture and market new products maintain and adapt our “hightouch” services to existing and emerging distribution channels maintain and enhance the recognition of our brands achieve a favorable mix of products successfully manage our inventories and refine our approach as to how and where we market and sell our products while we devote considerable effort and resources to shape analyze and respond to consumer preferences we recognize that consumer tastes cannot be predicted with certainty and can change rapidly the issue is compounded by the increasing use of digital and social media by consumers and the speed by which information and opinions are shared if we are unable to anticipate and respond to sudden challenges that we may face in the marketplace trends in the market for our products and changing consumer demands and sentiment our financial results will suffer in addition from time to time sales growth or profitability may be concentrated in a relatively small number of our brands if such a situation persists or a number of brands fail to perform as expected there could be a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

 14  

  

our future success depends on our ability to achieve our longterm strategy 

  

achieving our longterm strategy will require investment in new capabilities brands categories distribution channels technologies and emerging and more mature geographic markets these investments may result in shortterm costs without any current revenues and therefore may be dilutive to our earnings at least in the short term in addition we may dispose of or discontinue select brands or streamline operations and incur costs or restructuring and other charges in doing so although we believe that our strategy will lead to longterm growth in revenue and profitability we may not realize in full or in part the anticipated benefits the failure to realize benefits which may be due to our inability to execute plans global or local economic conditions competition changes in the beauty industry and the other risks described herein could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

acquisitions may expose us to additional risks 

  

we continuously review acquisition and investment opportunities that would expand our current product offerings our distribution channels increase the size and geographic scope of our operations or otherwise offer growth and operating efficiency opportunities there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate these transactions on favorable terms if required the financing for these transactions could result in an increase in our indebtedness dilute the interests of our stockholders or both the purchase price for some acquisitions may include additional amounts to be paid in cash in the future a portion of which may be contingent on the achievement of certain future operating results of the acquired business if the performance of any such acquired business exceeds such operating results then we may incur additional charges and be required to pay additional amounts 

  

acquisitions including strategic investments or alliances entail numerous risks which may include 

  

·   difficulties in integrating acquired operations or products including the loss of key employees from or customers of acquired businesses

  

·   diversion of management’s attention from our existing businesses

  

·   adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers

  

·   adverse impacts of margin and product cost structures different from those of our current mix of business and

  

·   risks of entering distribution channels categories or markets in which we have limited or no prior experience

  

our failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business and any adverse consequences associated with our acquisition activities could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

  

completed acquisitions typically result in additional goodwill andor an increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet we are required at least annually or as facts and circumstances exist to test goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to determine if impairment has occurred if the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the fair value of other intangible assets with indefinite lives in the period the determination is made we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

a general economic downturn or sudden disruption in business conditions may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items andor the financial strength of our customers that are retailers which could adversely affect our financial results 

  

the general level of consumer spending is affected by a number of factors including general economic conditions inflation interest rates energy costs and consumer confidence generally all of which are beyond our control consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower and may impact sales of our products a decline in consumer purchases of discretionary items also tends to impact our customers that are retailers we generally extend credit to a retailer based on an evaluation of its financial condition usually without requiring collateral however the financial difficulties of a retailer could cause us to curtail or eliminate business with that customer we may also assume more credit risk relating to the receivables from that retailer our inability to collect the receivable from one of our largest customers or from a group of customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition if a retailer was to liquidate we may incur additional costs if we choose to purchase the retailer’s inventory of our products to protect brand equity 

  

in addition sudden disruptions in business conditions for example from events such as a pandemic or other local or global health issues conflicts around the world or as a result of a terrorist attack retaliation or similar threats or as a result of adverse weather conditions climate changes or seismic events can have a shortterm and sometimes longterm impact on consumer spending 

  

events that impact consumers’ willingness or ability to travel andor purchase our products while traveling may impact our business including travel retail a significant contributor to our overall results and our strategy to market and sell products to international travelers at their destinations 

  

 15  

  

a downturn in the economies of or continuing recessions in the countries where we sell our products or a sudden disruption of business conditions in those countries could adversely affect consumer confidence the financial strength of our retailers and our sales and profitability we remain cautious of the continued slow retail growth in hong kong the decline in retail traffic primarily related to midtier department stores as well as certain m ž a ž c freestanding stores in the united states as a result of the impact of shifts in preferences of certain consumers as to where and how they shop for our products we also remain cautious of the continued strength of the us dollar in relation to most currencies additionally we are continuing to monitor the effects of the macroeconomic environment in brazil the united kingdom’s anticipated exit from the european union the political instability in turkey the impact of declining oil prices on consumer purchases in the middle east and global security issues

  

volatility in the financial markets and a related economic downturn in key markets or markets generally throughout the world could have a material adverse effect on our business while we currently generate significant cash flows from our ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities credit markets may experience significant disruptions deterioration in global financial markets or an adverse change in our credit ratings could make future financing difficult or more expensive if any financial institutions that are parties to our undrawn revolving credit facility or other financing arrangements such as foreign exchange or interest rate hedging instruments were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us this could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain foreign currency or interest rate exposures which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

changes in laws regulations and policies that affect our business could adversely affect our financial results 

  

our business is subject to numerous laws regulations and policies changes in the laws regulations and policies including the interpretation or enforcement thereof that affect or will affect our business including changes in accounting standards tax laws and regulations laws and regulations relating to data privacy anticorruption advertising marketing manufacturing distribution product registration ingredients chemicals and packaging laws in europe and elsewhere relating to selective distribution environmental or climate change laws regulations or accords trade rules and customs regulations and the outcome and expense of legal or regulatory proceedings and any action we may take as a result could adversely affect our financial results 

  

we are involved and may become involved in the future in disputes and other legal or regulatory proceedings that if adversely decided or settled could adversely affect our financial results 

  

we are and may in the future become party to litigation other disputes or regulatory proceedings in general claims made by us or against us in litigation disputes or other proceedings can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements injunctions or damages that could significantly affect our business or financial results we are currently vigorously contesting certain of these claims however it is not possible to predict the final resolution of the litigation disputes or proceedings to which we currently are or may in the future become party to and the impact of certain of these matters on our business results of operations and financial condition could be material 

  

government reviews inquiries investigations and actions could harm our business or reputation 

  

as we operate in various locations around the world our operations in certain countries are subject to significant governmental scrutiny and may be adversely impacted by the results of such scrutiny the regulatory environment with regard to our business is evolving and officials often exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply applicable regulations from time to time we may receive formal and informal inquiries from various government regulatory authorities as well as selfregulatory organizations about our business and compliance with local laws regulations or standards any determination that our operations or activities or the activities of our employees are not in compliance with existing laws regulations or standards could negatively impact us in a number of ways including the imposition of substantial fines interruptions of business loss of supplier vendor or other thirdparty relationships termination of necessary licenses and permits or similar results all of which could potentially harm our business andor reputation even if an inquiry does not result in these types of determinations it potentially could create negative publicity which could harm our business andor reputation 

  

our success depends in part on the quality efficacy and safety of our products 

  

our success depends in part on the quality efficacy and safety of our products if our products are found to be defective or unsafe our product claims are found to be deceptive or our products otherwise fail to meet our consumers’ expectations our relationships with customers or consumers could suffer the appeal of one or more of our brands could be diminished and we could lose sales andor become subject to liability or claims any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

our success depends in part on our key personnel 

  

our success depends in part on our ability to retain our key personnel including our executive officers and senior management team the unexpected loss of one or more of our key employees could adversely affect our business our success also depends in part on our continuing ability to identify hire train and retain other highly qualified personnel competition for these employees can be intense we may not be able to attract assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business this risk may be exacerbated by the stresses associated with the implementation of our strategic plan and other initiatives

we operate on a global basis with a majority of our fiscal 2016 net sales and operating income generated outside the united states we intend to reinvest these earnings in our foreign operations indefinitely except where we are able to repatriate these earnings to the united states without material incremental tax provision a majority of our cash and cash equivalents that result from these earnings remain outside the united states if these indefinitely reinvested earnings were repatriated into the united states as dividends we would be subject to additional taxes 

  

we maintain offices in over 50 countries and have key operational facilities located outside the united states that manufacture warehouse or distribute goods for sale throughout the world foreign operations are subject to many risks and uncertainties including 

  

·   fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and the relative costs of operating in different places which can affect our results of operations the value of our foreign assets the relative prices at which we and competitors sell products in the same markets the cost of certain inventory and noninventory items required in our operations and the relative prices at which we sell our products in different markets

  

·   foreign laws regulations and policies including restrictions on trade import and export license requirements and tariffs and taxes as well as united states laws and regulations relating to foreign trade operations and investment

  

·   lack of wellestablished or reliable legal and administrative systems in certain countries in which we operate and

  

·   adverse weather conditions currency exchange controls and social economic and geopolitical conditions such as terrorist attacks war or other military action

  

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects reputation results of operations and financial condition 

  

a disruption in operations or our supply chain could adversely affect our business and financial results 

  

as a company engaged in manufacturing and distribution on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including industrial accidents environmental events strikes and other labor disputes disruptions in supply chain or information systems loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites or suppliers product quality control safety increase in commodity prices and energy costs licensing requirements and other regulatory issues as well as natural disasters and other external factors over which we have no control if such an event were to occur it could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

  

we use a wide variety of direct and indirect suppliers of goods and services from around the world some of our products rely on single or a limited number of suppliers changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers could subject us to losses or adversely affect our ability to bring products to market further the failure of our suppliers to deliver goods and services in sufficient quantities in compliance with applicable standards and in a timely manner could adversely affect our customer service levels and overall business in addition any increases in the costs of goods and services for our business may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies in our operations 

  

our information systems and websites may be susceptible to cybersecurity breaches outages and other risks 

  

we have information systems that support our business processes including product development marketing sales order processing production distribution finance and intracompany communications throughout the world we have ecommerce mcommerce and other internet websites in the united states and many other countries these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire floods power loss telecommunications failures breakins and other events despite the implementation of network security measures our systems may be vulnerable to cybersecurity breaches such as computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering the occurrence of these or other events could disrupt or damage our information systems and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

failure to adequately maintain the security of our electronic and other confidential information could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

  

we are dependent upon automated information technology processes as part of our normal business activities we collect and store certain information that is confidential proprietary or otherwise sensitive including personal information with respect to customers and employees we may share some of this information with vendors who assist us with certain aspects of our business moreover the success of our ecommerce and mcommerce operations depends upon the secure transmission of confidential and personal data over public networks including the use of cashless payments any failure on the part of us or our vendors to maintain the security of our confidential data and our employees’ and customers’ personal information including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information could result in business disruption damage to our reputation financial obligations to third parties fines penalties regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs and also result in deterioration in our employees’ and customers’ confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages and thus could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to enhance our information security systems and could result in a disruption to our operations 

  

 17  

  

we are subject to risks associated with our global information systems 

  

our implementation and maintenance of global information systems including supply chain and finance systems human resource management systems creative asset management and retail operating systems as well as associated hardware and use of cloudbased models involve risks and uncertainties failure to implement and maintain these and other systems as planned in terms of timing specifications costs or otherwise could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

  

as we outsource functions we become more dependent on the entities performing those functions 

  

as part of our longterm strategy we are continually looking for opportunities to provide essential business services in a more costeffective manner in some cases this requires the outsourcing of functions or parts of functions that can be performed more effectively by external service providers these include certain information systems functions such as information technology operations and certain human resource functions such as employee benefit plan administration while we believe we conduct appropriate due diligence before entering into agreements with the outsourcing entity the failure of one or more entities to provide the expected services provide them on a timely basis or to provide them at the prices we expect may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition in addition if we transition systems to one or more new or among existing external service providers we may experience challenges that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

  

the trading prices of our securities periodically may rise or fall based on the accuracy of predictions of our earnings or other financial performance 

  

our business planning process is designed to maximize our longterm strength growth and profitability not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter we believe that this longerterm focus is in the best interests of the company and our stockholders at the same time however we recognize that it may be helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our forecast of net sales earnings per share and other financial metrics or projections accordingly when we announced our yearend financial results for fiscal 2016 we provided guidance as to certain assumptions including ranges for our expected net sales and earnings per share for the quarter ending september 30 2016 and the fiscal year ending june 30 2017 while we generally expect to provide updates to our guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter we assume no responsibility to update any of our forwardlooking statements at such times or otherwise in addition the longerterm guidance we provide is based on goals that we believe at the time guidance is given are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years such targets are more difficult to predict than our current quarter and fiscal year expectations we historically have paid dividends on our common stock and repurchased shares of our class a common stock at any time we could stop or suspend payment of dividends or stop or suspend our stock repurchase program and any such action could cause the market price of our stock to decline 

  

in all of our public statements when we make or update a forwardlooking statement about our net sales andor earnings expectations or expectations regarding restructuring or other initiatives we accompany such statements directly or by reference to a public document with a list of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we expect such a list is included among other places in our earnings press release and in our periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission eg in our reports on form 10k and form 10q these and other factors may make it difficult for us and for outside observers such as research analysts to predict what our earnings will be in any given fiscal quarter or year 

  

outside analysts and investors have the right to make their own predictions of our financial results for any future period outside analysts however have access to no more material information about our results or plans than any other public investor and we do not endorse their predictions as to our future performance nor do we assume any responsibility to correct the predictions of outside analysts or others when they differ from our own internal expectations if and when we announce actual results that differ from those that outside analysts or others have been predicting the market price of our securities could be affected investors who rely on the predictions of outside analysts or others when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk we take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in the prices of our securities 

  

we are controlled by the lauder family as a result of their control of us the lauder family has the ability to prevent or cause a change in control or approve prevent or influence certain actions by us 

  

as of august 18 2016 members of the lauder family beneficially own directly or indirectly shares of the company’s class a common stock with one vote per share and class b common stock with 10 votes per share having approximately 87 of the outstanding voting power of the common stock in addition there are four members of the lauder family who are employees including three who are members of our board of directors another family member is on our board and is a party to a consulting agreement and a license agreement with us 

  

as a result of the stock ownership and their positions at the company the lauder family has the ability to exercise significant control and influence over our business including all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors amendments to the certificate of incorporation and significant corporate transactions such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets for the foreseeable future 

  

 18  

  

  

we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the new york stock exchange rules and as a result are relying on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that are designed to provide protection to stockholders of companies that are not “controlled companies” 

  

the lauder family and their related entities own more than 50 of the total voting power of our common shares and as a result we are a “controlled company” under the new york stock exchange corporate governance standards as a controlled company we are exempt under the new york stock exchange standards from the obligation to comply with certain new york stock exchange corporate governance requirements including the requirements 1 that a majority of our board of directors consists of independent directors 2 that we have a nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities and 3 that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities 

  

while we have voluntarily caused our board to have a majority of independent directors and the written charters of our nominating and board affairs committee and the compensation committee to have the required provisions we are not requiring our nominating and board affairs committee and compensation committee to be comprised solely of independent directors as a result of our use of the “controlled company” exemptions investors will not have the same protection afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the new york stock exchange corporate governance requirements

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition at june 30 2016 and our results of operations for the three fiscal years ended june 30 2016 are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements these estimates and assumptions can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates we consider accounting estimates to be critical if both i the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and ii the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to the company’s financial condition our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition inventory pension and other postretirement benefit costs goodwill other intangible assets and longlived assets and income taxes 

  

management of the company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of the company’s board of directors 

  

 22  

  

revenue recognition 

our sales return accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net sales this accrual is calculated based on a history of actual returns estimated future returns and information provided by retailers regarding their inventory levels consideration of these factors results in an accrual for anticipated sales returns that reflects increases or decreases related to seasonal fluctuations experience has shown a relationship between retailer inventory levels and sales returns in the subsequent period as well as a consistent pattern of returns due to the seasonal nature of our business in addition as necessary specific accruals may be established for significant future known or anticipated events the types of known or anticipated events that we have considered and will continue to consider include but are not limited to the financial condition of our customers store closings by retailers changes in the retail environment and our decision to continue to support new and existing products

  

for a discussion of our revenue recognition accounting policy see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data — note 2 – summary of significant accounting policies ” 

  

inventory 

  

we state our inventory at the lower of cost or fairmarket value with cost being based on standard cost and production variances which approximate actual cost on the firstin firstout method we believe this method most closely matches the flow of our products from manufacture through sale the reported net value of our inventory includes saleable products promotional products raw materials and componentry and work in process that will be sold or used in future periods 

  

we also record an inventory obsolescence reserve which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated realizable value based on various product sales projections this reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales in addition and as necessary we may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events 

  

for further discussion of our inventory accounting policy see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data — note 2 — summary of significant accounting policies ” 

  

pension and other postretirement benefit costs 

  

we offer the following benefits to some or all of our employees a domestic trustbased noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan “us qualified plan” and an unfunded nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations collectively with the us qualified plan the “domestic plans” a domestic contributory defined contribution plan international pension plans which vary by country consisting of both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans deferred compensation arrangements and certain other postretirement benefit plans 

  

the amounts needed to fund future payouts under our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans are subject to numerous assumptions such as an anticipated discount rate expected rate of return on plan assets mortality rates and future compensation levels we evaluate these assumptions with our actuarial advisors and select assumptions that we believe reflect the economics underlying our pension and postretirement obligations while we believe these assumptions are within accepted industry ranges an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a direct impact on reported net earnings 

  

the discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated longterm bonds for fiscal 2016 net periodic benefit cost was determined using discount rates for our domestic plans of 440 and 370 and varying rates on our international plans between 075 and 700 the discount rates for our domestic plans were based on a bond portfolio that includes only longterm bonds with an aa rating or equivalent from a major rating agency we used an abovemean yield curve which represents an estimate of the effective settlement rate of the obligation and the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio are expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of our domestic plans for our international plans the discount rate in a particular country was principally determined based on a yield curve constructed from high quality corporate bonds in each country with the resulting portfolio having a duration matching that particular plan 

  

 23  

  

for fiscal 2016 we used an expected return on plan assets of 700 for our us qualified plan and varying rates of between 200 and 700 for our international plans in determining the longterm rate of return for a plan we consider the historical rates of return the nature of the plan’s investments and an expectation for the plan’s investment strategies see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 13 – pension deferred compensation and postretirement benefit plans ” for details regarding the nature of our pension and postretirement plan investments the difference between actual and expected return on plan assets is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income those gainslosses that are subject to amortization over future periods will be recognized as a component of the net periodic benefit cost in such future periods for fiscal 2016 our pension plans had actual return on assets of approximately 84 million as compared with expected return on assets of approximately 68 million the resulting net deferred gain of approximately 16 million when combined with gains and losses from previous years will be amortized over periods ranging from approximately 8 to 19 years the actual return on plan assets from our global pension plans was higher than expected primarily due to strong performance of fixed income assets attributable to our international pension plan in the united kingdom and the us qualified plan partially offset by equity underperformance globally 

  

a 25 basispoint change in the discount rate or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have had the following effect on fiscal 2016 pension expense 

  

   

our postretirement plans are comprised of health care plans that could be impacted by health care cost trend rates which may have a significant effect on the amounts reported a 100 basispoint change in assumed health care cost trend rates for fiscal 2016 would have had the following effects 

  

   

to determine the fiscal 2017 net periodic benefit cost we are using discount rates of 370 and 300 for the us qualified plan and the nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan respectively and varying rates for our international plans of between 25 and 600 we are using an expected return on plan assets of 700 for the us qualified plan and varying rates for our international pension plans of between 150 and 600 the net change in these two key assumptions from those used in fiscal 2016 will result in an increase in pension expense of approximately 17 million in fiscal 2017 

  

goodwill other intangible assets and longlived assets 

goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets other indefinitelived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized 

  

when testing goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment we have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test for fiscal 2016 and 2015 we elected to perform the qualitative assessment for the majority of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets this qualitative assessment included the review of certain macroeconomic factors and entityspecific qualitative factors to determine if it was morelikelythannot that the fair values of our reporting units were below carrying value for those reporting units acquired in fiscal 2015 a quantitative assessment was performed   we engaged thirdparty valuation specialists and used industry accepted valuation models and criteria that were reviewed and approved by various levels of management

  

for further discussion of the methods used and factors considered in our estimates as part of the impairment testing for goodwill other intangible assets and longlived assets see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 2 – summary of significant accounting policies ” 

  

income taxes 

  

we account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns as of june 30 2016 we have net deferred tax assets of 4223 million the net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization as well as the continued application of currently anticipated tax rates included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance of 1184 million for deferred tax assets where management believes it is morelikelythannot that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the relevant jurisdiction 

  

 24  

  

we provide tax reserves for us federal state local and foreign exposures relating to periods subject to audit the development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues potential outcomes and timing and is a subjective critical estimate we assess our tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting dates 

  

for further discussion of our income taxes accounting policy see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 2 – summary of significant accounting policies ” 

  

quantitative analysis 

  

during the threeyear period ended june 30 2016 there have not been material changes in the assumptions underlying these critical accounting policies nor to the related significant estimates the results of our business underlying these assumptions have not differed significantly from our expectations 

  

while we believe that the estimates that we have made are proper and the related results of operations for the period are presented fairly in all material respects other assumptions could reasonably be justified that would change the amount of reported net sales cost of sales or our provision for income taxes as they relate to the provisions for anticipated sales returns inventory obsolescence reserve and income taxes 

  

a 250 basispoint change in the items above collectively would have had the following effects for fiscal 2016 

  

   

 25  

  

  

results of operations 

we manufacture market and sell beauty products including those in the skin care makeup fragrance and hair care categories which are distributed in over 150 countries and territories the following table is a comparative summary of operating results for fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 and reflects the basis of presentation described in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 2 – summary of significant accounting policies and note 20 – segment data and related information ” for all periods presented products and services that do not meet our definition of skin care makeup fragrance and hair care have been included in the “other” category 

  

   

 26  

  

the following table presents certain consolidated earnings data as a percentage of net sales 

  

   

in order to meet the demands of consumers we continually introduce new products support new and established products through advertising merchandising and sampling and phase out existing products that no longer meet the needs of our consumers or our objectives the economics of developing producing launching supporting and discontinuing products impact our sales and operating performance each period the introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products which we take into account in our business planning 

  

nongaap financial measures 

  

we use certain nongaap financial measures among other financial measures to evaluate our operating performance which represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business management believes that excluding certain items that are not comparable from period to period helps investors and others compare operating performance between two periods while we consider the nongaap measures useful in analyzing our results they are not intended to replace or act as a substitute for any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with us gaap see “reconciliations of nongaap financial measures ” beginning on page 42 for reconciliations between nongaap financial measures and the most directly comparable us gaap measures 

  

we operate on a global basis with the majority of our net sales generated outside the united states accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our results of operations therefore we present certain net sales operating results and diluted net earnings per common share information excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations to provide a framework for assessing the performance of our underlying business outside the united states constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant periodoverperiod we calculate constant currency information by translating current year results using prior year weightedaverage foreign currency exchange rates 

  

overview 

  

we believe the best way to continue to increase stockholder value is to provide our customers and consumers with superior products and services in the most efficient and profitable manner while recognizing consumers’ changing behaviors and shopping preferences we are guided by our longterm strategy through fiscal 2019 which has numerous initiatives across geographic regions product categories brands channels of distribution and functions that are designed to grow our sales provide cost efficiencies leverage our strengths and make us more productive and profitable we plan to continue to build upon and leverage our history of outstanding creativity innovation entrepreneurship high quality products and services and engaging communications while investing for longterm sustainable growth 

  

 27  

  

our diverse and highly desirable brand portfolio positions us well to capitalize on opportunities in fast growing and profitable areas of prestige beauty we believe our range of prestige product offerings allows us to increase our share of a consumer’s beauty routine and source consumers from brands sold in mass distribution skin care our most profitable product category historically remains a strategic priority for us and we continue to support our large longstanding skin care product lines including advanced night repair from estée lauder clinique’s 3step skin care system and crème de la mer from la mer we have also continued to develop and introduce new products such as new dimension and renutriv ultimate diamond transformative energy eye crème from estée lauder clinique smart moisturizers clinique smart treatment oil and clinique sculptwear lift and contour serum for face and neck as well as the renewal oil and genaissance de la mer the serum essence from la mer we supplemented our skin care offerings through the fiscal 2015 acquisitions of glamglow and rodin olio lusso while growth in global prestige skin care remained relatively slow in fiscal 2016 growth in global prestige makeup continued to show the fastest acceleration this trend benefited our makeup sales particularly in certain areas in europe the middle east  africa such as the united kingdom we also introduced new products including new collections from our makeup artist brands and smashbox double wear makeup to go liquid compact and pure color envy liquid lip potion from estée lauder and chubby lash fattening mascara and beyond perfecting foundation  concealer from clinique we believe that the makeup category represents one of our most compelling growth opportunities our fragrance category continues to benefit from increased sales of jo malone london and tom ford fragrances new launches such as mimosa  cardamom from jo malone london and tom ford noir pour femme and incremental net sales from our fiscal 2015 acquisitions of le labo and editions de parfums frédéric malle in addition we are expanding our hair care brands in salons and other retail channels to complement the strategies in our existing business we are continuously looking to acquire and grow smaller brands that we believe have significant growth potential and may provide unique opportunities for profitable growth in the future during our fiscal 2016 third quarter we further expanded our luxury fragrance portfolio with the acquisition of by kilian a prestige fragrance brand 

  

our global footprint provides many avenues of growth we are leveraging our regional organizations and the talents and expertise of our people in an effort to continue to be locally relevant with our products services channels marketing and visual merchandising we are seeking share growth in large imagebuilding core markets such as the united states the united kingdom france italy japan and korea by strengthening our presence in these areas during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 we purchased a minority interest in have  be co ltd the korean company behind the skin care brands dr jart  and do the right thing this investment provides us with a strategic opportunity to participate in the expanding korean beauty trend in addition we are broadening our presence in emerging markets such as china the middle east eastern europe brazil russia india mexico and south africa while we continue to see slow department store traffic in some markets which is particularly affecting estée lauder and clinique we are growing faster in other channels such as e and mcommerce 

  

in north america we are hosting targeted instore events to support key innovations in multiple channels and we are increasing our presence in specialty multibrand retailers and freestanding retail stores internationally we are expanding our business in freestanding stores in european perfumeries and pharmacies and in department stores particularly in the united kingdom and certain markets in asia we approach distribution strategically by brand as each is at a different stage of development we seek to optimize distribution in both channels and geographies matching each brand with appropriate opportunities we focus on those areas where we believe our brands will expand consumer coverage and gain highquality distribution consistent with their positioning as part of this strategy we continue to expand brands in our travel retail channel which benefits from increasing international passenger traffic travel retail continues to be an important channel for brand building and profit margin expansion although it is susceptible to a number of external factors including fluctuations in currency exchange rates and consumers’ willingness and ability to travel and spend we have strategies focused on consumers who purchase in the travel retail channel in stores at their travel destinations or when they return to their home market this includes partnering with our retailers to open individual boutiques within airports to compete more effectively in this channel we are broadening our online portfolio around the world by adding brands to existing markets and entering new markets resulting in strong net sales growth in the online channel and we continue to develop and test omnichannel concepts to better serve consumers as they shop across channels we have identified opportunities to expand our online portfolio around the world which we expect will result in continued net sales growth in this channel our success in delivering particularly strong online growth in emerging markets is a result of taking key learnings from our online strategy in established markets such as the united states the united kingdom and germany and customizing them to meet local market needs to further drive our online sales we are planning new e and mcommerce site launches in new and existing markets and we are extending our thirdparty platform model which has been successful in china into certain other international locations 

  

while our business is performing well overall we are faced with strong competition globally and economic challenges in certain countries in particular we are cautious of the continued slow retail growth in hong kong the decline in retail traffic primarily related to midtier department stores as well as certain m ž a ž c freestanding stores in the united states as a result of the impact of shifts in preferences of certain consumers as to where and how they shop for our products we are also cautious of the continued strength of the us dollar in relation to most currencies additionally we are continuing to monitor the effects of the macroeconomic environment in brazil the united kingdom’s anticipated exit from the european union the political instability in turkey the impact of declining oil prices on consumer purchases in the middle east and global security issues

  

 28  

  

we believe we can to some extent offset the impact of these challenges by accelerating areas of strength utilizing the various growth drivers among our brands channels and markets however if economic conditions or the degree of uncertainty or volatility worsen or the adverse conditions previously discussed are further prolonged then there could be a negative effect on ongoing consumer confidence demand and spending and as a result on our business we will continue to monitor these and other risks that may affect our business 

  

we navigate through shortterm volatility while focusing on our longterm strategy and using our multiple engines of growth that we believe will promote sustainable growth we are increasing our presence in emerging markets continuing efforts to revitalize and accelerate growth in our heritage brands focusing on key demographics and seeking opportunities to add to our diverse brand portfolio we are also strengthening our consumer engagement by leveraging digital marketing and enhancing our social media strategies and execution we will continue to drive product packaging and conceptual innovation and creativity that we believe will enable us to introduce products that resonate with consumers some initiatives will involve new subcategories and others may expand key franchises we expect to leverage our top line growth through greater productivity due in part to cost savings and efficiencies from our strategic modernization initiative “smi” 

  

on may 3 2016 we announced a multiyear initiative “leading beauty forward” to build on our strengths and better leverage our cost structure to free resources for investment to continue our growth momentum leading beauty forward is designed to enhance our gotomarket capabilities reinforce our leadership in global prestige beauty and continue creating sustainable value we plan to approve specific initiatives under leading beauty forward through fiscal 2019 and expect to complete those initiatives through fiscal 2021 we expect that leading beauty forward will result in related restructuring and other charges totaling between 600 million and 700 million before taxes consisting of employeerelated costs asset writeoffs and other costs to implement these initiatives after its full implementation we expect leading beauty forward to yield annual net benefits primarily in selling general and administrative expenses of between 200 million and 300 million before taxes we expect to reinvest a portion behind future growth initiatives for additional information about leading beauty forward see “ item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 7 – charges associated with restructuring activities ” 

  

in addition to leading beauty forward investment in our global information systems is an ongoing process we have implemented initiatives to leverage our smi foundation that are focused on sustainment and global efficiencies as we modernize our key processes related systems and infrastructure we continue to develop upgraded capabilities to support our human resource operations and are making investments to upgrade our global technology infrastructure “gti” as well as our retail systems and retail capabilities globally these initiatives are expected to improve profitability by enhancing gross margin and supporting efficiencies in select operating expenses and working capital freeing resources to strategically reinvest in activities to support our future growth 

  

in october 2015 we approved plans to transform and modernize our gti to fundamentally change the way we deliver information technology services internally such initiative the “gti restructuring” as part of the gti restructuring we transitioned our gti from companyowned assets to a primarily vendorowned cloudbased model where we pay for services as they are used this model with a different thirdparty provider is expected to provide an enhanced scalable platform to better support current and future requirements help us achieve key strategic opportunities and improve our agility and flexibility to respond to the demands of the business by leveraging more advanced technologies this transition is expected to result in operational efficiencies and reduce our information technology service and infrastructure costs in the future the implementation of the gti restructuring was substantially completed during fiscal 2016 net savings from this initiative may be partially reinvested in other strategic areas of our business for additional information about the gti restructuring initiative see “ item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 7 – charges associated with restructuring activities ”

we rolled out the last major wave of smi in july 2014 and most of our locations are now sapenabled we plan to continue the implementation of sap at our remaining locations throughout the next few fiscal years in connection with the july 2014 implementation some retailers accelerated their sales orders that would have occurred in our fiscal 2015 first quarter into our fiscal 2014 fourth quarter in advance of this implementation to provide adequate safety stock to mitigate any potential shortterm business interruption associated with the smi rollout the negative impact on the net sales and operating results for the year ended june 30 2015 by product category and geographic region was as follows 

  

   

the lower orders during the year ended june 30 2015 created a favorable comparison between fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 of approximately 178 million in net sales and approximately 127 million in operating results and impacted our operating margin comparisons we believe that the presentation of certain yeartodate comparative information in the following discussions that excludes the impact of the timing of these orders is useful in analyzing the net sales performance and operating results of our business

reported net sales in fiscal 2016 grew in each product category with the exception of skin care and in each geographic region with the exception of asiapacific the overall decline in the skin care category was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and the relatively slow growth in global prestige skin care that particularly impacted net sales in north america asiapacific and travel retail however this category benefited from increased sales of certain products particularly from la mer and origins net sales increases in product offerings by m ž a ž c smashbox tom ford clinique bobbi brown and estée lauder globally drove the growth in the makeup category our fragrance category benefited from net sales increases from our luxury brands incremental sales from our acquisitions during the past two years also helped drive our skin care and fragrance sales the net sales increase in our hair care category was driven by product offerings from aveda and bumble and bumble as well as expanded consumer coverage each of our product categories benefited from brand expansion comparable door sales growth from certain brands new product offerings and growth from emerging markets

net sales in fiscal 2015 decreased from fiscal 2014 entirely driven by the negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 519 million and the difficult comparison due to the accelerated orders as discussed above of approximately 357 million inclusive of these items higher net sales in our makeup and hair care product categories were more than offset by declines in our skin care and fragrance product categories while geographically we experienced lower net sales in each region our makeup artist and luxury brands continued to grow net sales through successful product launches and the broadening of their presence globally however net sales from estée lauder and clinique were challenged in all of our product categories and reflected a difficult comparison to fiscal 2014 which featured significant launch activity related to the reformulation of certain iconic skin care products and several significant fragrance launches in addition we experienced strong growth in certain channels such as specialtymulti online and freestanding stores as well as expansion in emerging markets excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and the impact of the accelerated orders net sales would have increased in each of our major product categories and within each geographic region 

  

returns associated with restructuring activities are not allocated to our product categories or geographic regions because they result from activities that are deemed a companywide initiative to redesign resize and reorganize select corporate functions and gotomarket structures accordingly the following discussions of net sales by product categories and geographic regions exclude the fiscal 2016 impact of returns associated with restructuring activities of 14 million

fiscal 2016 as compared with fiscal 2015 

  

the lower advertising merchandising and sampling costs in fiscal 2016 as a percentage of net sales as compared to fiscal 2015 were in part due to the brand and channel mix of our spend as certain media formats carry different cost structures certain of our brands have lower costs associated with advertising as they focus on digital and social media strategies and rely less on print and television advertising which carry a higher media cost 

  

adjusting for the impact of the fiscal 2015 accelerated orders operating expense margin in fiscal 2016 would have increased an additional 90 basis points to 160 basis points unfavorable as compared to fiscal 2015 this additional increase as a percentage of net sales was reflected in general and administrative selling and shipping and advertising merchandising and sampling costs 

  

fiscal 2015 as compared with fiscal 2014 

  

the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was a result of higher support spending behind capabilitybuilding initiatives such as information technology as well as for acquisitionrelated expenses the higher store operating and selling costs in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 were primarily driven by the expansion of m ž a ž c and jo malone london freestanding retail stores

  

in fiscal 2015 adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders into the fiscal 2014 fourth quarter operating expenses as a percentage of net sales would have increased approximately 10 basis points primarily reflecting an increase in general and administrative expenses and higher store operating costs partially offset by lower spending on advertising merchandising and sampling and lower charges related to the remeasurement of net monetary assets in venezuela

provision for income taxes 

  

   

the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2016 was principally attributable to a lower effective tax rate related to our foreign operations as well as a decrease in income tax reserve adjustments recorded in the current year 

  

the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2015 was principally attributable to a lower effective tax rate related to our foreign operations which included venezuela remeasurement charges in fiscal 2015 and 2014 of 53 million and 383 million respectively for which no tax benefit was provided this reduction was partially offset by an increase in income tax reserve adjustments recorded in fiscal 2015 

  

the provision for income taxes represents us federal foreign state and local income taxes the effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state and local income taxes the taxation of foreign income and income tax reserve adjustments which represent changes in our net liability for unrecognized tax benefits including tax settlements and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations our effective tax rate will change from quarter to quarter based on recurring and nonrecurring factors including but not limited to the geographical mix of earnings enacted tax legislation state and local income taxes tax reserve adjustments the ultimate disposition of deferred tax assets relating to stockbased compensation and the interaction of various global tax strategies in addition changes in judgment from the evaluation of new information resulting in the recognition derecognition or remeasurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period are recognized separately in the quarter of change

financial condition 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

overview 

  

our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program borrowings from the issuance of longterm debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks and other lenders in the united states and abroad at june 30 2016 we had cash and cash equivalents of 9141 million compared with 10214 million at june 30 2015 our cash and cash equivalents are maintained at a number of financial institutions to mitigate the risk of uninsured balances we select financial institutions based on their credit ratings and financial strength and we perform ongoing evaluations of these institutions to limit our concentration risk exposure 

  

the decrease in cash and cash equivalents from the prior year primarily reflects cash used to purchase short and longterm investments pursuant to our cash investment strategy our investment objectives include capital preservation maintaining adequate liquidity asset diversification and achieving appropriate returns within the guidelines set forth in our investment policy these investments are classified as availableforsale and totaled 15045 million and 9178 million at june 30 2016 and 2015 respectively 

  

our business is seasonal in nature and accordingly our working capital needs vary from time to time we may enter into investing and financing transactions that require additional funding to the extent that these needs exceed cash from operations we could subject to market conditions issue commercial paper issue longterm debt securities or borrow under our revolving credit facilities 

  

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that cash on hand cash generated from operations available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business operations information systems enhancements capital expenditures potential stock repurchases restructuring activities commitments and other contractual obligations on both a nearterm and longterm basis our cash and cash equivalents and short and longterm investment balances at june 30 2016 include approximately 2002 million of cash and short and longterm investments in offshore jurisdictions associated with our permanent reinvestment strategy we do not believe that the indefinite reinvestment of these funds offshore impairs our ability to meet our domestic debt or working capital obligations if these indefinitely reinvested earnings were repatriated into the united states as dividends we would be subject to additional taxes 

  

the effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years generally we have been able to introduce new products at higher prices increase prices and implement other operating efficiencies to sufficiently offset cost increases which have been moderate

credit ratings 

  

changes in our credit ratings will likely result in changes in our borrowing costs our credit ratings also impact the cost of our revolving credit facility as discussed below downgrades in our credit ratings may reduce our ability to issue commercial paper andor longterm debt and would likely increase the relative costs of borrowing a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating as of august 18 2016 our commercial paper is rated a1 by standard  poor’s and p1 by moody’s and our longterm debt is rated a with a stable outlook by standard  poor’s and a2 with a stable outlook by moody’s

  

debt and access to liquidity 

  

total debt as a percent of total capitalization excluding noncontrolling interests increased to 39 at june 30 2016 from 31 at june 30 2015 primarily due to the issuance of the 4500 million of 170 senior notes due may 2021 “2021 senior notes” and an additional 1500 million of our 4375 senior notes due june 2045 “2045 senior notes” 

  

for further information regarding our current and longterm debt and available financing see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 10 – debt ”

  

cash flows 

  

   

the fiscal 2016 decrease in net cash provided by operating activities as compared with fiscal 2015 was primarily driven by the accelerated orders in connection with our july 2014 smi implementation which contributed to an unfavorable comparison in certain working capital components and the increase in net earnings the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities also reflected an unfavorable change in accounts receivable reflecting the timing of shipments and collections and higher longterm payments related to new freestanding retail store locations including cash payments made to former tenants to acquire the rights under commercial property leases also contributing to the decrease was an unfavorable change in accounts payable primarily due to the timing of expenses these decreases were partially offset by an increase in other accrued liabilities due in part to higher accrued restructuring costs and employee incentive compensation 

  

the fiscal 2015 increase in net cash provided by operating activities as compared with fiscal 2014 primarily reflected a favorable change in accounts receivable reflecting the timing of shipments and improved collections a favorable change in inventory reflecting our initiative to better align supply levels with forecasted demand and other supply chain improvements and a favorable change in accounts payable primarily due to the timing of payments the accelerated orders in connection with our july 2014 smi implementation also contributed to the favorable changes in these working capital components and the decrease in net earnings as compared to fiscal 2014 

  

the fiscal 2016 decrease in net cash used for investing activities as compared with fiscal 2015 primarily reflected lower net purchases of investments in connection with our cash investment strategy the decrease in cash used for investing activities also reflected lower payments related to acquisitions cash paid in connection with the fiscal 2015 acquisitions was partially offset by cash paid in connection with the fiscal 2016 acquisition of by kilian and an additional purchase price trueup payment related to a fiscal 2015 acquisition partially offsetting the decrease was cash paid in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 for the longterm investment in have  be co ltd the company behind the skin care brands dr jart  and do the right thing as well as higher capital expenditure activity primarily related to leasehold improvements 

  

the fiscal 2015 increase in net cash used for investing activities as compared with fiscal 2014 primarily reflected purchases of investments in connection with the implementation of our cash investment strategy as previously discussed also contributing to the increase was cash paid in connection with the acquisitions of rodin olio lusso le labo editions de parfums frédéric malle and glamglow partially offsetting cash used for investing activities were proceeds from the disposition of investments and to a lesser extent lower capital expenditure activity

  

the fiscal 2016 decrease in net cash used for financing activities as compared with fiscal 2015 primarily reflected the proceeds from the issuance of the 2021 senior notes and additional 2045 senior notes as well as lower treasury stock purchases partially offset by higher dividend payments 

  

 46  

  

the fiscal 2015 increase in net cash used for financing activities as compared with fiscal 2014 primarily reflected an increase in treasury stock purchases and higher dividend payments partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of the 2045 senior notes 

  

dividends 

  

for a summary of quarterly cash dividends declared per share on our class a and class b common stock during the year ended june 30 2016 and through august 18 2016 see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 15 – common stock ”

  

pension and postretirement plan funding 

  

several factors influence the annual funding requirements for our pension plans for the us qualified plan we seek to maintain appropriate funded percentages for any future contributions to the us qualified plan we would seek to contribute an amount or amounts that would not be less than the minimum required by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended “erisa” and subsequent pension legislation and would not be more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes for each international plan our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations in addition amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions as detailed in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — critical accounting policies and estimates ” the effect of our pension plan funding on future operating results will depend on economic conditions employee demographics mortality rates the number of participants electing to take lumpsum distributions investment performance and funding decisions 

  

for the us qualified plan we maintain an investment strategy of matching the duration of a substantial portion of the plan assets with the duration of the underlying plan liabilities this strategy assists us in maintaining our overall funded ratio during fiscal 2016 we made a cash contribution to the us qualified plan of 300 million for fiscal 2016 and 2015 we met or exceeded all contribution requirements under erisa regulations for the us qualified plan as we continue to monitor the funded status we may decide to make cash contributions to the us qualified plan or our postretirement medical plan in the united states during fiscal 2017 

  

the following table summarizes actual and expected benefit payments and contributions for our other pension and postretirement plans 

  

   

commitments and contingencies 

  

certain of our business acquisition agreements include contingent consideration or “earnout” provisions these provisions generally require that we pay to the seller or sellers of the business additional amounts based on the performance of the acquired business since the size of each payment depends upon performance of the acquired business we do not expect that such payments will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or financial condition 

  

for additional contingencies refer to “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data — note 14 — commitments and contingencies contractual obligations ”

credit risk 

  

for a discussion of credit risk see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 11 – derivative financial instruments credit risk ” 

  

market risk 

  

we use a valueatrisk model to assess the market risk of our derivative financial instruments valueatrisk represents the potential losses for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors for a specified time period and confidence level we estimate valueatrisk across all of our derivative financial instruments using a model with historical volatilities and correlations calculated over the past 250day period the high low and average measured valueatrisk during fiscal 2016 and 2015 related to our derivative financial instruments is as follows 

  

   

the model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 percent confidence level we used a statistical simulation model that valued our derivative financial instruments against one thousand randomly generated market price paths 

our calculated valueatrisk exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may or may not occur it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated based upon actual fluctuations in market rates operating exposures and the timing thereof and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year valueatrisk during fiscal 2016 was higher than fiscal 2015 primarily due to higher volatility in foreign exchange rates we believe however that any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the derivative financial instrument was intended 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

we do not maintain any offbalance sheet arrangements transactions obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities other than operating leases that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations 

  

recently issued accounting standards

 item 9a controls and procedures 

  

a   evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures

  

our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the securities and exchange commission and to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management including our principal executive and financial officers to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure the chief executive officer “ceo” and the chief financial officer “cfo” with assistance from other members of management have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of june 30 2016 and based on their evaluation have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date due to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting 

  

b   internal control over financial reporting

  

a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 we identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to ineffective general information technology controls in the areas of user access and program change management over certain information technology systems that are relevant to the company’s financial reporting processes and system of internal control over financial reporting as a result our business process automated and manual controls that are dependent on the affected general information technology controls were also ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted however this material weakness did not result in any identified misstatements to the financial statements or restatement of priorperiod financial statements and there were no changes in previously released financial results 

  

as a result of the material weakness noted above we completed additional substantive procedures prior to filing this annual report on form 10k for the year ended june 30 2016 “form 10k” based on these procedures management believes that our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles our ceo and cfo have certified that based on such officer’s knowledge the financial statements and other financial information included in this form 10k fairly present in all material respects the financial condition results of operations and cash flows of the company as of and for the periods presented in this form 10k in addition we have developed a remediation plan for this material weakness which is described below 

  

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting and the description of the material weakness are included on page f2 of this annual report on form 10k and is incorporated herein by reference the company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an adverse audit report on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2016 which appears on page f3 of this annual report on form 10k 

  

c   changes in internal controls over financial reporting

  

except for the control deficiencies discussed above that have been assessed as a material weakness as of june 30 2016 there have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f of the exchange act that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

  

d   remediation plan

  

management is actively implementing a remediation plan to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weakness are remediated such that these controls will operate effectively the remediation actions we are taking and expect to take include i improving general information technology program change control activities and policies including processes to maintain sufficient documentation evidencing execution of these policies ii improving the control activities and procedures associated with user access to certain information technology systems including proper segregation of duties related to the affected information systems iii educating and retraining control owners regarding internal control processes to mitigate identified risks and maintaining adequate documentation to evidence the effective design and operation of such processes and iv implementing enhanced controls to monitor the effectiveness of the underlying business process controls that are dependent on the data and financial reports generated from the relevant information systems 

  

we believe that these actions and the improvements we expect to achieve as a result will effectively remediate the material weakness however the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting will not be considered remediated until the remediated controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded through testing that these controls are operating effectively we expect that the remediation of this material weakness will be completed in fiscal 2017

 item 1a risk factors 

  

there are risks associated with an investment in our securities please consider the following risks and all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k and in our subsequent filings with the securities and exchange commission “sec” our business may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial if any of the events contemplated by the following discussion of risks should occur or other risks arise or develop our business prospects financial condition and results of operations as well as the trading prices of our securities may be adversely affected 

  

the beauty business is highly competitive and if we are unable to compete effectively our results will suffer 

we face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world including multinational consumer product companies some of these competitors have greater resources than we do and may be able to respond to changing business and economic conditions more quickly than us competition in the beauty business is based on pricing of products innovation perceived value service to the consumer promotional activities advertising special events new product introductions ecommerce and mcommerce initiatives and other activities it is difficult for us to predict the timing and scale of our competitors’ actions in these areas a consolidation in the retail trade may result in us becoming increasingly dependent on key retailers this could result in an increased risk related to the concentration of our customers a severe adverse impact on the business operations of our customers could have a corresponding material adverse effect on us if one or more of our largest customers change their strategies including pricing or promotional activities or change or terminate their relationship with us there could be a material adverse effect on our business our ability to compete also depends on the continued strength of our brands our ability to attract and retain key talent and other personnel the efficiency of our manufacturing facilities and distribution network and our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property and those other rights used in our business in addition certain of our key retailers around the world market and sell competing brands or are owned or otherwise affiliated with companies that market and sell competing brands our inability to continue to compete effectively in key countries around the world could have an adverse impact on our business 

  

our inability to anticipate and respond to market trends and changes in consumer preferences could adversely affect our financial results 

our continued success depends on our ability to anticipate gauge and react in a timely and costeffective manner to changes in consumer tastes for skin care makeup fragrance and hair care products attitudes toward our industry and brands as well as to where and how consumers shop for those products we must continually work to develop manufacture and market new products maintain and adapt our “hightouch” services to existing and emerging distribution channels maintain and enhance the recognition of our brands achieve a favorable mix of products successfully manage our inventories and refine our approach as to how and where we market and sell our products while we devote considerable effort and resources to shape analyze and respond to consumer preferences we recognize that consumer tastes cannot be predicted with certainty and can change rapidly the issue is compounded by the increasing use of digital and social media by consumers and the speed by which information and opinions are shared if we are unable to anticipate and respond to sudden challenges that we may face in the marketplace trends in the market for our products and changing consumer demands and sentiment our financial results will suffer 

  

our future success depends on our ability to achieve our longterm strategy 

achieving our longterm strategy will require investment in new capabilities brands categories distribution channels technologies and emerging and more mature geographic markets these investments may result in shortterm costs without any current revenues and therefore may be dilutive to our earnings at least in the short term in addition we may dispose of or discontinue select brands or streamline operations and incur costs or restructuring and other charges in doing so although we believe that our strategy will lead to longterm growth in revenue and profitability we may not realize in full or in part the anticipated benefits the failure to realize benefits which may be due to our inability to execute plans global or local economic conditions competition changes in the beauty industry and the other risks described herein could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

we continuously review acquisition and investment opportunities that would expand our current product offerings our distribution channels increase the size and geographic scope of our operations or otherwise offer growth and operating efficiency opportunities there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate these transactions on favorable terms if required the financing for these transactions could result in an increase in our indebtedness dilute the interests of our stockholders or both the purchase price for some acquisitions may include additional amounts to be paid in cash in the future a portion of which may be contingent on the achievement of certain future operating results of the acquired business if the performance of any such acquired business exceeds such operating results then we may incur additional charges and be required to pay additional amounts 

  

acquisitions including strategic investments or alliances entail numerous risks which may include 

·   difficulties in integrating acquired operations or products including the loss of key employees from or customers of acquired businesses

·   diversion of management’s attention from our existing businesses

·   adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers

·   adverse impacts of margin and product cost structures different from those of our current mix of business and

·   risks of entering distribution channels categories or markets in which we have limited or no prior experience

  

our failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business and any adverse consequences associated with our acquisition activities could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

  

completed acquisitions typically result in additional goodwill andor an increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet we are required at least annually or as facts and circumstances exist to test goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to determine if impairment has occurred if the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the fair value of other intangible assets with indefinite lives in the period the determination is made we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

a general economic downturn or sudden disruption in business conditions may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items andor the financial strength of our customers that are retailers which could adversely affect our financial results 

the general level of consumer spending is affected by a number of factors including general economic conditions inflation interest rates energy costs and consumer confidence generally all of which are beyond our control consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower and may impact sales of our products a decline in consumer purchases of discretionary items also tends to impact our customers that are retailers we generally extend credit to a retailer based on an evaluation of its financial condition usually without requiring collateral however the financial difficulties of a retailer could cause us to curtail or eliminate business with that customer we may also assume more credit risk relating to the receivables from that retailer our inability to collect the receivable from one of our largest customers or from a group of customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition if a retailer was to liquidate we may incur additional costs if we choose to purchase the retailer’s inventory of our products to protect brand equity 

  

in addition sudden disruptions in business conditions for example as a consequence of events such as a pandemic or local or international conflicts around the world or as a result of a terrorist attack retaliation and the threat of further attacks or retaliation or as a result of adverse weather conditions or climate changes or seismic events can have a shortterm and sometimes longterm impact on consumer spending 

  

events that impact consumers’ willingness or ability to travel andor purchase our products while traveling may impact our business including travel retail a significant contributor to our overall results and our strategy to market and sell products to international travelers at their destinations 

  

a downturn in the economies of or continuing recessions in the countries where we sell our products or a sudden disruption of business conditions in those countries could adversely affect consumer confidence the financial strength of our retailers and our sales and profitability we remain cautious of slower retail growth in hong kong and china a decline in spending by russian and brazilian travelers unfavorable foreign exchange due to the strength of the us dollar in relation to most currencies and lower net sales from our travel retail business in korea one of our largest markets for travel retail due to a decrease in the number of travelers there as a result of the recent outbreak of the mers virus additionally we are monitoring the effects of economic instability in russia greece and brazil

volatility in the financial markets and a related economic downturn in key markets or markets generally throughout the world could have a material adverse effect on our business while we currently generate significant cash flows from our ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities credit markets may experience significant disruptions deterioration in global financial markets or an adverse change in our credit ratings could make future financing difficult or more expensive if any financial institutions that are parties to our undrawn revolving credit facility or other financing arrangements such as foreign exchange or interest rate hedging instruments were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us this could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain foreign currency or interest rate exposures which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

changes in laws regulations and policies that affect our business could adversely affect our financial results 

our business is subject to numerous laws regulations and policies changes in the laws regulations and policies including the interpretation or enforcement thereof that affect or will affect our business including changes in accounting standards tax laws and regulations laws and regulations relating to data privacy anticorruption advertising marketing manufacturing distribution product registration ingredients chemicals and packaging laws in europe and elsewhere relating to selective distribution environmental or climate change laws regulations or accords trade rules and customs regulations and the outcome and expense of legal or regulatory proceedings and any action we may take as a result could adversely affect our financial results 

  

we are involved and may become involved in the future in disputes and other legal or regulatory proceedings that if adversely decided or settled could adversely affect our financial results 

we are and may in the future become party to litigation other disputes or regulatory proceedings in general claims made by us or against us in litigation disputes or other proceedings can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements injunctions or damages that could significantly affect our business or financial results we are currently vigorously contesting certain of these claims however it is not possible to predict the final resolution of the litigation disputes or proceedings to which we currently are or may in the future become party to and the impact of certain of these matters on our business results of operations and financial condition could be material 

  

government reviews inquiries investigations and actions could harm our business or reputation 

as we operate in various locations around the world our operations in certain countries are subject to significant governmental scrutiny and may be adversely impacted by the results of such scrutiny the regulatory environment with regard to our business is evolving and officials often exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply applicable regulations from time to time we may receive formal and informal inquiries from various government regulatory authorities as well as selfregulatory organizations about our business and compliance with local laws regulations or standards any determination that our operations or activities or the activities of our employees are not in compliance with existing laws regulations or standards could negatively impact us in a number of ways including the imposition of substantial fines interruptions of business loss of supplier vendor or other thirdparty relationships termination of necessary licenses and permits or similar results all of which could potentially harm our business andor reputation even if an inquiry does not result in these types of determinations it potentially could create negative publicity which could harm our business andor reputation 

  

our success depends in part on the quality efficacy and safety of our products 

our success depends in part on the quality efficacy and safety of our products if our products are found to be defective or unsafe our product claims are found to be deceptive or our products otherwise fail to meet our consumers’ expectations our relationships with customers or consumers could suffer the appeal of one or more of our brands could be diminished and we could lose sales andor become subject to liability or claims any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

our success depends in part on our key personnel 

our success depends in part on our ability to retain our key personnel including our executive officers and senior management team the unexpected loss of one or more of our key employees could adversely affect our business our success also depends in part on our continuing ability to identify hire train and retain other highly qualified personnel competition for these employees can be intense we may not be able to attract assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business this risk may be exacerbated by the stresses associated with the implementation of our strategic plan and other initiatives 

  

we are subject to risks related to our foreign operations 

we operate on a global basis with a majority of our fiscal 2015 net sales and operating income generated outside the united states we intend to reinvest these earnings in our foreign operations indefinitely except where we are able to repatriate these earnings to the united states without material incremental tax provision a majority of our cash and cash equivalents that result from these earnings remain outside the united states if these indefinitely reinvested earnings were repatriated into the united states as dividends we would be subject to additional taxes 

  

 12  

  

we maintain offices in over 50 countries and have key operational facilities located outside the united states that manufacture warehouse or distribute goods for sale throughout the world foreign operations are subject to many risks and uncertainties including 

·   fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and the relative costs of operating in different places which can affect our results of operations the value of our foreign assets the relative prices at which we and competitors sell products in the same markets the cost of certain inventory and noninventory items required in our operations and the relative prices at which we sell our products in different markets

·   foreign laws regulations and policies including restrictions on trade import and export license requirements and tariffs and taxes as well as united states laws and regulations relating to foreign trade operations and investment

·   lack of wellestablished or reliable legal and administrative systems in certain countries in which we operate and

·   adverse weather conditions currency exchange controls and social economic and geopolitical conditions such as terrorist attacks war or other military action

  

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects reputation results of operations and financial condition 

  

a disruption in operations or our supply chain could adversely affect our business and financial results 

as a company engaged in manufacturing and distribution on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including industrial accidents environmental events strikes and other labor disputes disruptions in supply chain or information systems loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites or suppliers product quality control safety increase in commodity prices and energy costs licensing requirements and other regulatory issues as well as natural disasters and other external factors over which we have no control if such an event were to occur it could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

  

we use a wide variety of direct and indirect suppliers of goods and services from around the world some of our products rely on single or a limited number of suppliers changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers could subject us to losses or adversely affect our ability to bring products to market further the failure of our suppliers to deliver goods and services in sufficient quantities in compliance with applicable standards and in a timely manner could adversely affect our customer service levels and overall business in addition any increases in the costs of goods and services for our business may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies in our operations 

  

our information systems and websites may be susceptible to cybersecurity breaches outages and other risks 

we have information systems that support our business processes including product development marketing sales order processing production distribution finance and intracompany communications throughout the world we have ecommerce mcommerce and other internet websites in the united states and many other countries these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire floods power loss telecommunications failures breakins and other events despite the implementation of network security measures our systems may be vulnerable to cybersecurity breaches such as computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering the occurrence of these or other events could disrupt or damage our information systems and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

failure to adequately maintain the security of our electronic and other confidential information could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we are dependent upon automated information technology processes as part of our normal business activities we collect and store certain information that is confidential proprietary or otherwise sensitive including personal information with respect to customers and employees we may share some of this information with vendors who assist us with certain aspects of our business moreover the success of our ecommerce and mcommerce operations depends upon the secure transmission of confidential and personal data over public networks including the use of cashless payments any failure on the part of us or our vendors to maintain the security of our confidential data and our employees’ and customers’ personal information including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information could result in business disruption damage to our reputation financial obligations to third parties fines penalties regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs and also result in deterioration in our employees’ and customers’ confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages and thus could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to enhance our information security systems and could result in a disruption to our operations 

  

we are subject to risks associated with our global information systems 

our implementation of global information systems including supply chain and finance systems human resource management systems and retail operating systems involves risks and uncertainties failure to implement and maintain these and other systems as planned in terms of timing specifications costs or otherwise could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

  

 13  

  

as we outsource functions we become more dependent on the entities performing those functions 

as part of our longterm strategy we are continually looking for opportunities to provide essential business services in a more costeffective manner in some cases this requires the outsourcing of functions or parts of functions that can be performed more effectively by external service providers these include certain information systems functions such as information technology operations and certain human resource functions such as employee benefit plan administration while we believe we conduct appropriate due diligence before entering into agreements with the outsourcing entity the failure of one or more entities to provide the expected services provide them on a timely basis or to provide them at the prices we expect may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition in addition if we transition systems to one or more new or among existing external service providers we may experience challenges that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

  

the trading prices of our securities periodically may rise or fall based on the accuracy of predictions of our earnings or other financial performance 

our business planning process is designed to maximize our longterm strength growth and profitability not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter we believe that this longerterm focus is in the best interests of the company and our stockholders at the same time however we recognize that it may be helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our forecast of net sales earnings per share and other financial metrics or projections accordingly when we announced our yearend financial results for fiscal 2015 we provided guidance as to certain assumptions including ranges for our expected net sales and earnings per share for the quarter ending september 30 2015 and the fiscal year ending june 30 2016 while we generally expect to provide updates to our guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter we assume no responsibility to update any of our forwardlooking statements at such times or otherwise in addition the longerterm guidance we provide is based on goals that we believe at the time guidance is given are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years such targets are more difficult to predict than our current quarter and fiscal year expectations 

  

in all of our public statements when we make or update a forwardlooking statement about our net sales andor earnings expectations or expectations regarding restructuring or other initiatives we accompany such statements directly or by reference to a public document with a list of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we expect such a list is included among other places in our earnings press release and in our periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission eg in our reports on form 10k and form 10q these and other factors may make it difficult for us and for outside observers such as research analysts to predict what our earnings will be in any given fiscal quarter or year 

  

outside analysts and investors have the right to make their own predictions of our financial results for any future period outside analysts however have access to no more material information about our results or plans than any other public investor and we do not endorse their predictions as to our future performance nor do we assume any responsibility to correct the predictions of outside analysts or others when they differ from our own internal expectations if and when we announce actual results that differ from those that outside analysts or others have been predicting the market price of our securities could be affected investors who rely on the predictions of outside analysts or others when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk we take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in the prices of our securities 

  

we are controlled by the lauder family as a result of their control of us the lauder family has the ability to prevent or cause a change in control or approve prevent or influence certain actions by us 

as of august 14 2015 members of the lauder family beneficially own directly or indirectly shares of the company’s class a common stock with one vote per share and class b common stock with 10 votes per share having approximately 87 of the outstanding voting power of the common stock in addition there are four members of the lauder family who are employees including three who are members of our board of directors another family member is on our board and is a party to a consulting agreement and a license agreement with us as a result of the stock ownership and their positions at the company the lauder family has the ability to exercise significant control and influence over our business including without limitation all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors amendments to the certificate of incorporation and significant corporate transactions such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets for the foreseeable future 

  

we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the new york stock exchange rules and as a result are relying on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that are designed to provide protection to stockholders of companies that are not “controlled companies” 

the lauder family and their related entities own more than 50 of the total voting power of our common shares and as a result we are a “controlled company” under the new york stock exchange corporate governance standards as a controlled company we are exempt under the new york stock exchange standards from the obligation to comply with certain new york stock exchange corporate governance requirements including the requirements 

·   that a majority of our board of directors consists of independent directors

·   that we have a nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities and

·   that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities

  

 14  

  

while we have voluntarily caused our board to have a majority of independent directors and the written charters of our nominating and board affairs committee and the compensation committee to have the required provisions we are not requiring our nominating and board affairs committee and compensation committee to be comprised solely of independent directors as a result of our use of the “controlled company” exemptions investors will not have the same protection afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the new york stock exchange corporate governance requirements

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition at june 30 2015 and our results of operations for the three fiscal years ended june 30 2015 are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements these estimates and assumptions can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates we consider accounting estimates to be critical if both i the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and ii the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to the company’s financial condition our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition inventory pension and other postretirement benefit costs goodwill other intangible assets and longlived assets and income taxes 

  

management of the company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of the company’s board of directors 

  

revenue recognition 

revenues from product sales are recognized upon transfer of ownership including passage of title to the customer and transfer of the risk of loss related to those goods in the americas region sales are generally recognized at the time the product is shipped to the customer and in the europe the middle east  africa and asiapacific regions sales are generally recognized based upon the customer’s receipt in certain circumstances transfer of title takes place at the point of sale for example at our retail stores 

  

revenues are reported on a net sales basis which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual product returns received discounts incentive arrangements with retailers and an amount established for anticipated product returns our practice is to accept product returns from retailers only if properly requested and approved in accepting returns we typically provide a credit to the retailer against accounts receivable from that retailer as a percentage of gross sales returns were 34 in fiscal 2015 and 2014 and 33 in fiscal 2013 

  

our sales return accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net sales this accrual is calculated based on a history of actual returns estimated future returns and information provided by retailers regarding their inventory levels consideration of these factors results in an accrual for anticipated sales returns that reflects increases or decreases related to seasonal fluctuations experience has shown a relationship between retailer inventory levels and sales returns in the subsequent period as well as a consistent pattern of returns due to the seasonal nature of our business in addition as necessary specific accruals may be established for significant future known or anticipated events the types of known or anticipated events that we have considered and will continue to consider include but are not limited to the financial condition of our customers store closings by retailers changes in the retail environment and our decision to continue to support new and existing products 

  

inventory 

we state our inventory at the lower of cost or fairmarket value with cost being based on standard cost and production variances which approximate actual cost on the firstin firstout method we believe this method most closely matches the flow of our products from manufacture through sale the reported net value of our inventory includes saleable products promotional products raw materials and componentry and work in process that will be sold or used in future periods inventory cost includes raw materials direct labor and overhead as well as inbound freight manufacturing overhead is allocated to the cost of inventory based on the normal production capacity unallocated overhead during periods of abnormally low production levels are recognized as cost of sales in the period in which they are incurred 

  

we also record an inventory obsolescence reserve which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated realizable value based on various product sales projections this reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales in addition and as necessary we may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events 

  

pension and other postretirement benefit costs 

we offer the following benefits to some or all of our employees a domestic trustbased noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan “us qualified plan” and an unfunded nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations collectively with the us qualified plan the “domestic plans” a domestic contributory defined contribution plan international pension plans which vary by country consisting of both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans deferred compensation arrangements and certain other postretirement benefit plans 

  

the amounts needed to fund future payouts under our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans are subject to numerous assumptions such as an anticipated discount rate expected rate of return on plan assets mortality rates and future compensation levels we evaluate these assumptions with our actuarial advisors and select assumptions that we believe reflect the economics underlying our pension and postretirement obligations while we believe these assumptions are within accepted industry ranges an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a direct impact on reported net earnings 

  

 19  

  

the discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated longterm bonds for fiscal 2015 net periodic benefit cost was determined using discount rates for our domestic plans of 360 and 430 and varying rates on our international plans between 50 and 675 the discount rates for our domestic plans were based on a bond portfolio that includes only longterm bonds with an aa rating or equivalent from a major rating agency we used an abovemean yield curve which represents an estimate of the effective settlement rate of the obligation and the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio are expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of our domestic plans for our international plans the discount rate in a particular country was principally determined based on a yield curve constructed from high quality corporate bonds in each country with the resulting portfolio having a duration matching that particular plan 

  

for fiscal 2015 we used an expected return on plan assets of 750 for our us qualified plan and varying rates of between 200 and 675 for our international plans in determining the longterm rate of return for a plan we consider the historical rates of return the nature of the plan’s investments and an expectation for the plan’s investment strategies see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data — note 13 — pension deferred compensation and postretirement benefit plans ” for details regarding the nature of our pension and postretirement plan investments the difference between actual and expected return on plan assets is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income those gainslosses that are subject to amortization over future periods will be recognized as a component of the net periodic benefit cost in such future periods for fiscal 2015 our pension plans had actual return on assets of approximately 61 million as compared with expected return on assets of approximately 72 million the resulting net deferred loss of approximately 11 million when combined with gains and losses from previous years will be amortized over periods ranging from approximately 7 to 18 years the actual return on plan assets from our global pension plans was lower than expected primarily due to underperformance of us plan assets partially offset by stronger than expected returns on international plan assets 

  

a 25 basispoint change in the discount rate or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have had the following effect on fiscal 2015 pension expense 

  

   

our postretirement plans are comprised of health care plans that could be impacted by health care cost trend rates which may have a significant effect on the amounts reported a onepercentagepoint change in assumed health care cost trend rates for fiscal 2015 would have had the following effects 

  

   

to determine the fiscal 2016 net periodic benefit cost we are using discount rates of 440 and 370 for the us qualified plan and the nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan respectively and varying rates for our international plans of between 75 and 700 we are using an expected return on plan assets of 700 for the us qualified plan and varying rates for our international pension plans of between 200 and 700 the net change in these two key assumptions from those used in fiscal 2015 will result in an increase in pension expense of approximately 11 million in fiscal 2016

goodwill other intangible assets and longlived assets 

goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets other indefinitelived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized 

  

we assess goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets at least annually for impairment as of the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which is one level below our operating segments we identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and management of each operating segment regularly reviews the operating results of those components we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to determine carrying values for our reporting units when testing goodwill for impairment we have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test if necessary the quantitative impairment test is performed in two steps i we determine if an indication of impairment exists by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value and ii if there is an impairment we measure the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill when testing other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment we also have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is morelikelythannot that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative test the quantitative impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets encompasses calculating the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value if the carrying value exceeds the fair value an impairment charge is recorded

  

for fiscal 2015 we elected to perform the qualitative assessment for all of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets this qualitative assessment included the review of certain macroeconomic factors and entityspecific qualitative factors to determine if it was morelikelythannot that the fair values of our reporting units were below carrying value we considered macroeconomic factors including the global economic growth general macroeconomic trends for the markets in which the reporting units operate and the intangible assets are employed and the growth of the global prestige beauty industry in addition to these macroeconomic factors among other things we considered the reporting units’ current results and forecasts any changes in the nature of the business any significant legal regulatory contractual political or other business climate factors changes in the industrycompetitive environment changes in the composition or carrying amount of net assets and our intention to sell or dispose of a reporting unit or cease the use of a trademark with regard to our fiscal 2015 acquisitions of rodin olio lusso le labo editions de parfums frédéric malle and glamglow the carrying values of the related goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets as of the assessment date approximated their fair values as a result of our qualitative assessment we concluded that it was morelikelythannot that our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets were not impaired and we did not need to perform a quantitative assessment

  

for fiscal 2014 we tested our reporting units for impairment using the twostep approach and our other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment by comparing their fair values to their carrying values as a result of these tests we concluded the fair values of our reporting units and the fair values of our indefinitelived intangible assets substantially exceeded their carrying values 

  

we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable when such events or changes in circumstances occur a recoverability test is performed comparing projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset or asset group to its carrying value if the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value an impairment would be recorded for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value which is determined by discounting estimated future cash flows

we account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns as of june 30 2015 we have current net deferred tax assets of 2790 million and noncurrent net deferred tax assets of 721 million the net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization as well as the continued application of currently anticipated tax rates included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance of 1209 million for deferred tax assets where management believes it is morelikelythannot that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the relevant jurisdiction based on our assessments no additional valuation allowance is required if our assessment of realizability of a deferred tax asset changes an increase to a valuation allowance will result in a reduction of net earnings at that time while the reduction of a valuation allowance will result in an increase of net earnings at that time

we provide tax reserves for us federal state local and foreign exposures relating to periods subject to audit the development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues potential outcomes and timing and is a subjective critical estimate we assess our tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting dates for those tax positions where it is morelikelythannot that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those tax positions where it is not morelikelythannot that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements we classify applicable interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes although the outcome relating to these exposures is uncertain in management’s opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating from these exposures if actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates they could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations

  

quantitative analysis 

during the threeyear period ended june 30 2015 there have not been material changes in the assumptions underlying these critical accounting policies nor to the related significant estimates the results of our business underlying these assumptions have not differed significantly from our expectations 

  

while we believe that the estimates that we have made are proper and the related results of operations for the period are presented fairly in all material respects other assumptions could reasonably be justified that would change the amount of reported net sales cost of sales or our provision for income taxes as they relate to the provisions for anticipated sales returns inventory obsolescence reserve and income taxes for fiscal 2015 had these estimates been changed simultaneously by 25 in either direction our reported gross profit would have increased or decreased by approximately 59 million and the provision for income taxes would have increased or decreased by approximately 02 million the collective impact of these changes on operating income net earnings attributable to the estée lauder companies inc and net earnings attributable to the estée lauder companies inc per diluted common share would be an increase or decrease of approximately 59 million 57 million and 01 respectively

results of operations 

we manufacture market and sell beauty products including those in the skin care makeup fragrance and hair care categories which are distributed in over 150 countries and territories the following table is a comparative summary of operating results for fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 and reflects the basis of presentation described in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data — note 2 — summary of significant accounting policies and note 20 — segment data and related information ” for all periods presented products and services that do not meet our definition of skin care makeup fragrance and hair care have been included in the “other” category

the following table presents certain consolidated earnings data as a percentage of net sales 

  

   

in order to meet the demands of consumers we continually introduce new products support new and established products through advertising merchandising and sampling and phase out existing products that no longer meet the needs of our consumers or our objectives the economics of developing producing launching supporting and discontinuing products impact our sales and operating performance each period the introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products which we take into account in our business planning 

  

we operate on a global basis with the majority of our net sales generated outside the united states accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our results of operations therefore we present certain net sales operating results and diluted net earnings per common share information excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations to provide a framework for assessing the performance of our underlying business outside the united states constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant periodoverperiod we calculate constant currency information by translating current year results using prior year weightedaverage foreign currency exchange rates 

  

overview 

  

we believe the best way to continue to increase stockholder value is to provide our customers and consumers with superior products and services that they have come to expect from us in the most efficient and profitable manner while recognizing consumers’ changing behaviors and shopping preferences to be the global leader in prestige beauty we are guided by our longterm strategy through fiscal 2018 which has numerous initiatives across geographic regions product categories brands channels of distribution and functions that are designed to grow our sales leverage our strengths and make us more productive and profitable we also plan to continue to build upon and leverage our history of outstanding creativity innovation and entrepreneurship in high quality products and services and engaging communications 

  

 24  

  

we believe our diverse and highly desirable brand portfolio positions us well to capitalize on opportunities in fast growing and profitable areas in prestige beauty skin care our most profitable product category remains a strategic priority for us and as a result we continue to support our large longstanding skin care product lines including advanced night repair from estée lauder clinique’s 3step skin care system and crème de la mer from la mer we are also developing and introducing new products such as new dimension from estée lauder the clinique sonic system purifying cleansing brush and clinique smart customrepair serum as well as skin care masks from la mer we also supplemented our skin care offerings in fiscal 2015 through the recent acquisitions of glamglow and rodin olio lusso while global prestige skin care growth was slower in fiscal 2015 global growth in prestige makeup accelerated in part due to social media activities this benefited our makeup sales and we continue to believe that the makeup category represents one of our most compelling growth opportunities during the year we successfully launched a number of new products including new collections from our makeup artist brands pure color envy sculpting lipstick and sculpting eye shadow palette from estée lauder and pop lip colour and primer beyond perfecting foundation and concealer and chubby stick sculpting products from clinique our fragrance category has benefited from new launches expanded distribution from our luxury fragrance brands and our recent acquisitions of le labo and editions de parfums frédéric malle in addition we are expanding our hair care brands in salons and other retail channels to complement the strategies in our existing business we are continuously looking to acquire and incubate smaller brands that we believe have growth potential and may provide unique opportunities for profitable growth in the future 

  

our global footprint provides us many avenues of growth enabling us to quickly utilize our strengths to capture opportunities around the world by leveraging our regional organization and to align the talents and expertise of our people in an effort to assure that we are locally relevant with our products services channels marketing and visual merchandising we are seeking share growth in large imagebuilding cities within core markets such as the united states the united kingdom france italy and japan by strengthening our geographic presence there in addition we continue to expand our presence and accelerate growth in emerging markets such as china the middle east eastern europe brazil russia and south africa during fiscal 2015 we have seen a general slowdown in department store traffic in some markets which has particularly affected estée lauder and clinique but we have been able to grow our business in other channels in north america we continued to expand our presence in specialty multibrand retailers and freestanding retail stores internationally we expanded our business in freestanding stores in european perfumeries and pharmacies and in department stores particularly in the united kingdom and certain markets in asia travel retail remains an important source of sales growth profitability and brand building although it is susceptible to a number of external factors including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and consumers’ willingness and ability to travel we have strategies focused on consumers who purchase in this channel in stores at their travel destinations or when they return to their home market in addition we have identified opportunities to expand our online portfolio around the world resulting in strong net sales growth in this channel and we are in the early stages of developing and testing omnichannel concepts to better serve consumers as they shop across channels we are applying what we have learned from our digital strategy in the united states to other markets such as brazil and russia to further drive our online sales we are expanding our presence on key thirdparty platforms in china where we are seeing promising results 

  

while our business is performing well overall we continue to see competitive pressures and economic challenges in certain countries around the world  we remain cautious of slower retail growth in hong kong and china a decline in spending by russian and brazilian travelers unfavorable foreign exchange due to the strength of the us dollar in relation to most currencies and lower net sales from our travel retail business in korea one of our largest markets for travel retail due to a decrease in the number of travelers there as a result of the recent outbreak of the mers virus additionally we are monitoring the effects of economic instability in russia greece and brazil

  

we believe we can to some extent offset the impact of these challenges by accelerating areas where we see more strength by utilizing the various growth drivers among our brands channels and markets however if economic conditions or the degree of uncertainty or volatility worsen or the adverse conditions previously discussed are further prolonged then we expect there could be a negative effect on ongoing consumer confidence demand and spending and as a result our business we will continue to monitor these and other risks that may affect our business 

  

looking ahead to fiscal 2016 we plan to execute our strategy by focusing on the multiple growth engines that we believe will promote longterm sustainable growth these include strengthening our presence in emerging markets continuing to revitalize and accelerate growth in our heritage brands focusing on key demographics and seeking opportunities to add to our diverse brand portfolio we will continue to drive innovation and creativity that we believe will enable us to introduce products that resonate with consumers some will involve new subcategories and others may expand key franchises we expect to leverage our topline growth through greater productivity due in part to cost savings and efficiencies from our strategic modernization initiative “smi” we plan to continue allocating our resources to growth drivers such as digital capabilities including the development of omnichannel concepts retail store expansion and information technology enhancements we also plan to continue to succeed in high growth product categories subcategories and channels of distribution benefit from regional opportunities focus on emerging market and luxury consumers and enhance our local relevance

investment in our global information systems is ongoing we have implemented initiatives to leverage our smi foundation that are focused on sustainment and global efficiencies as we continue to modernize our key processes related systems and infrastructure we are also developing upgraded capabilities to support our human resource operations and are making investments to upgrade our global technology infrastructure as well as our retail systems and retail capabilities globally these initiatives are expected to improve profitability by enhancing gross margin and supporting efficiencies in select operating expenses and working capital freeing resources to strategically reinvest in activities to support our future growth 

  

we rolled out the last major wave of smi in july 2014 and currently most of our locations are sapenabled we plan to continue the implementation of sap at our remaining locations throughout the next few fiscal years in connection with the july 2014 implementation some retailers accelerated their sales orders that would have occurred in our fiscal 2015 first quarter into our fiscal 2014 fourth quarter in advance of this implementation to provide adequate safety stock to mitigate any potential shortterm business interruption associated with the smi rollout the impact on net sales and operating results by product category and geographic region was as follows 

  

   

the higher orders at the end of fiscal 2014 coupled with the resulting lower orders in the beginning of fiscal 2015 created a difficult comparison between fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 which resulted in a variance of approximately 357 million in net sales and approximately 254 million in operating results and adversely impacted our operating margin comparisons while these additional orders had an adverse impact on our fiscal 2015 net sales and operating results comparisons we expect there to be corresponding favorable comparisons on our first quarter and full year fiscal 2016 net sales and operating results we believe the presentation of certain yeartodate comparative information in the following discussions that excludes the impact of the timing of these orders is useful in analyzing the net sales performance and operating results of our business

fiscal 2015 as compared with fiscal 2014 

  

net sales 

  

net sales decreased 2 or 1884 million to 107804 million entirely driven by the negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 519 million and the difficult comparison due to the accelerated orders as discussed above of approximately 357 million inclusive of these items higher net sales in our makeup and hair care product categories were more than offset by declines in our skin care and fragrance product categories while geographically we experienced lower net sales in each region our makeup artist and luxury brands continued to grow net sales through successful product launches and expanded global distribution however net sales from estée lauder and clinique have been challenged in all of our product categories and reflect a difficult comparison to the prior year which featured significant launch activity related to the reformulation of certain iconic skin care products and several significant fragrance launches in addition we are experiencing strong growth in certain channels such as specialtymulti online and freestanding stores as well as expansion in emerging markets excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and the impact of the accelerated orders net sales would have increased 6 with growth in each of our major product categories and within each geographic region

skin care 

net sales of skin care products decreased 6 or 2911 million to 44787 million this decrease reflected the negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 215 million the decrease as reported reflected lower net sales of estée lauder and clinique products of approximately 303 million combined primarily due to the accelerated orders and significant launch activity in the prior year related to the reformulation of certain iconic products these decreases were partially offset by higher sales of la mer products primarily due to new launches and expanded distribution in the travel retail channel and incremental sales from our recent acquisitions of approximately 23 million combined excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and the impact of the accelerated orders skin care net sales would have increased 2 excluding the impact of foreign currency translation skin care net sales decreased 2 adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders reported net sales in skin care would have decreased 2 

  

makeup 

makeup net sales increased 2 or 944 million to 43046 million this change reflected the negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 205 million the net sales increase as reported primarily reflected higher net sales from our makeup artist brands tom ford and smashbox of approximately 293 million combined sales from our makeup artist brands benefited from new product offerings as well as expanded distribution in a number of channels including our freestanding retail stores the higher net sales from tom ford and smashbox were primarily due to expanded distribution of tom ford in the travel retail channel and smashbox in specialty multibrand retailers partially offsetting these increases were lower sales of clinique and estée lauder products of approximately 161 million combined excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and the impact of the accelerated orders makeup net sales would have increased 10 excluding the impact of foreign currency translation makeup net sales increased 7 adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders reported net sales in makeup would have increased 5 

  

fragrance 

net sales of fragrance products decreased 1 or 86 million to 14164 million this decrease was entirely driven by the negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 75 million the decrease as reported primarily reflected lower sales of certain estée lauder clinique coach and tommy hilfiger fragrances of approximately 98 million combined these decreases were mostly offset by the strong performance of luxury fragrances from jo malone london and tom ford that resulted in higher net sales of approximately 91 million combined excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and the impact of the accelerated orders fragrance net sales would have increased 8 excluding the impact of foreign currency translation fragrance net sales increased 5 adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders reported net sales in fragrance would have increased 2 

  

hair care 

hair care net sales increased 3 or 150 million to 5306 million this change reflected the negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 22 million the increase in net sales reflected expanded global distribution of aveda products in department stores freestanding retail stores salons and in the travel retail channel and bumble and bumble products in specialty multibrand retailers the category also benefited from increased sales of smooth infusion naturally straight from aveda as well as the expansion of the hairdresser’s invisible oil line of products from bumble and bumble which contributed approximately 12 million to the increase combined partially offsetting these increases were lower sales of the invati line of products and dry remedy shampoo from aveda of approximately 6 million combined excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and the impact of the accelerated orders hair care net sales would have increased 7 excluding the impact of foreign currency translation hair care net sales increased 7 adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders reported net sales in hair care would have increased 3 

  

geographic regions

net sales in the americas decreased 1 or 585 million to 45138 million net sales in the united states and canada as reported decreased approximately 53 million combined primarily due to lower net sales from certain of our heritage brands driven by the impact of the accelerated orders and a difficult comparison with the prior year which featured significant launch activity related to the reformulation of certain iconic products these decreases were partially offset by higher net sales from our makeup artist luxury and hair care brands net sales in latin america decreased approximately 5 million primarily reflecting lower net sales in venezuela partially offset by higher net sales in brazil excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and the impact of the accelerated orders net sales in the americas would have increased 6 excluding the impact of foreign currency translation net sales in the americas increased 2 adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders reported net sales in the americas would have increased 2

in europe the middle east  africa net sales decreased 2 or 773 million to 40864 million driven by approximately 285 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation due to the strength of the us dollar in relation to most currencies in the region lower sales in our travel retail business germany iberia and italy totaled approximately 185 million combined the lower sales in our travel retail business were driven by the impact of the accelerated orders excluding this impact travel retail net sales increased due to a strategic expansion of certain of our luxury brands and our makeup artist brands partially offset by the negative impact of the social instability in hong kong as well as changes in the purchasing power of key groups of travelers the decrease in sales in germany iberia and italy was due to the weakening of the euro against the us dollar excluding this impact net sales in germany iberia and italy increased primarily driven by certain of our luxury makeup artist and hair care brands as a result of expanded distribution and new product introductions partially offsetting these reported decreases were higher sales in the united kingdom and the middle east of approximately 122 million combined the increase in sales in the united kingdom was primarily driven by our makeup artist and luxury brands higher sales in the middle east were primarily driven by certain of our luxury brands and makeup artist brands as a result of new product introductions and expanded distribution excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and the impact of the accelerated orders net sales in europe the middle east  africa would have increased 8 excluding the impact of foreign currency translation europe the middle east  africa net sales increased 5 adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders reported net sales in europe the middle east  africa would have increased 1

we strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market which may account for differences in regional sales growth 

  

cost of sales 

  

cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales decreased to 195 as compared with 197 in the prior year this improvement reflected favorable changes in foreign exchange transactions of approximately 20 basis points partially offset by an increase in obsolescence charges of approximately 10 basis points 

  

since certain promotional activities are a component of sales or cost of sales and the timing and level of promotions vary with our promotional calendar we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in the cost of sales percentage in addition future cost of sales may be impacted by channels of distribution and their relative growth 

  

operating expenses 

  

operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 656 as compared with 636 in the prior year and were impacted by the accelerated orders and brand and channel mix as certain retail and media formats carry different cost structures as a percentage of net sales this increase primarily reflected an increase in general and administrative expenses of approximately 100 basis points as a result of higher support spending behind capabilitybuilding initiatives such as information technology as well as for acquisitionrelated expenses this increase also reflected higher store operating and selling costs of approximately 110 basis points combined primarily driven by the expansion of m · a · c and jo malone london freestanding retail stores also contributing to this increase were higher costs associated with stockbased compensation and higher spending on advertising merchandising and sampling as a percentage of net sales of approximately 10 basis points each partially offsetting these increases were lower charges related to the measurement of net monetary assets in venezuela of approximately 30 basis points and favorable changes in foreign exchange transactions of approximately 10 basis points adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders into the fiscal 2014 fourth quarter operating expenses as a percentage of net sales would have increased approximately 10 basis points primarily reflecting an increase in general and administrative expenses and higher store operating costs partially offset by lower spending on advertising merchandising and sampling and lower charges related to the remeasurement of net monetary assets in venezuela

  

changes in advertising merchandising and sampling spending result from the type timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts as well as the markets and brands being emphasized

operating results 

  

operating income decreased 12 or 2213 million to 16063 million driven entirely by the negative impact of the accelerated orders of approximately 254 million and foreign currency translation of approximately 131 million operating margin decreased to 149 of net sales as compared with 167 in the prior year reflecting an increase in our operating expense margin partially offset by our higher gross margin adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders operating income would have increased 2 and operating margin would have remained flat 

  

our skin care makeup and fragrance results declined primarily reflecting the accelerated orders as well as certain challenges and difficult comparisons affecting our net sales growth in certain markets and channels by our heritage brands as previously discussed these decreases were partially offset by improved results from our makeup artist certain luxury and our hair care brands while certain operating expenses have increased as a percentage of net sales during the current year we have been able to implement cost containment measures to mitigate the impact 

  

product categories 

the overall change in operating results in each product category was negatively impacted by the accelerated orders into the fiscal 2014 fourth quarter from certain of our retailers due to our implementation of smi as follows skin care approximately 144 million makeup approximately 82 million fragrance approximately 28 million and the impact on hair care was de minimis

operating income in the americas decreased 44 or 2350 million to 3023 million primarily reflecting the decrease in net sales from our heritage brands in the united states and canada associated with the accelerated orders and the significant launch activity in the prior year related to the reformulation of certain iconic products as well as higher general and administrative expenses which include acquisitionrelated expenses this decrease was partially offset by lower advertising merchandising and sampling spending by our heritage brands due to the lower launch activity and a reallocation of spending among media formats the region also benefited from higher results in latin america primarily driven by lower charges related to the remeasurement of net monetary assets in venezuela adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders operating income in the americas would have decreased 27 

  

in europe the middle east  africa operating income increased less than 1 or 50 million to 9433 million higher operating results in the united kingdom the middle east france india russia and switzerland of approximately 83 million combined were partially offset by lower operating results in our travel retail business due to the accelerated orders and to a lesser extent germany of approximately 79 million combined the higher results in france india russia and switzerland were primarily due to an increase in constant currency net sales adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders operating income in europe the middle east  africa would have increased 13 

  

in asiapacific operating income increased 3 or 116 million to 3607 million higher results in china korea and australia totaled approximately 49 million combined these higher results were partially offset by lower results in japan due to the accelerated orders and singapore of approximately 40 million combined the lower results in singapore were primarily due to lower net sales adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders operating income in asiapacific would have increased 16 

  

interest expense 

  

interest expense increased to 600 million as compared with 594 million in the prior year primarily due to higher short and long term debt levels 

  

 29  

  

interest income and investment income net 

  

interest income and investment income net increased to 143 million as compared with 86 million in the prior year primarily due to higher investment income as a result of an increase in short and longterm investment balances and rates in connection with our modified cash investment strategy as well as realized gains on investments see “financial condition” below for further discussion of our modified cash investment strategy 

  

provision for income taxes 

  

the provision for income taxes represents us federal foreign state and local income taxes the effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state and local income taxes the taxation of foreign income and income tax reserve adjustments which represent changes in our net liability for unrecognized tax benefits including tax settlements and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations our effective tax rate will change from quarter to quarter based on recurring and nonrecurring factors including but not limited to the geographical mix of earnings enacted tax legislation state and local income taxes tax reserve adjustments the ultimate disposition of deferred tax assets relating to stockbased compensation and the interaction of various global tax strategies in addition changes in judgment from the evaluation of new information resulting in the recognition derecognition or remeasurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period are recognized separately in the quarter of change 

  

the effective rate for income taxes was 299 and 320 for fiscal 2015 and 2014 respectively the decrease of 210 basis points was principally attributable to a lower effective tax rate related to our foreign operations which included venezuela remeasurement charges in fiscal 2015 and 2014 of 53 million and 383 million respectively for which no tax benefit was provided this reduction was partially offset by an increase in income tax reserve adjustments recorded in the current year 

  

net earnings attributable to the estÉe lauder companies inc 

  

net earnings attributable to the estée lauder companies inc as compared with the prior year decreased 10 or 1152 million to 10889 million and diluted net earnings per common share decreased 8 from 306 to 282

nongaap financial measures 

  

we use certain nongaap financial measures among other financial measures to evaluate our operating performance which represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business management believes that excluding these items that are not comparable from period to period helps investors and others compare operating performance between two periods while we consider the nongaap measures useful in analyzing our results they are not intended to replace or act as a substitute for any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with us gaap the following tables present net sales operating income and diluted net earnings per common share adjusted to exclude the impact of accelerated orders associated with the july 2014 smi rollout adjustments associated with restructuring activities and the venezuela remeasurement charges the tables provide reconciliations between these nongaap financial measures and the most directly comparable us gaap measures

hair care net sales increased 5 or 267 million to 5156 million reflecting the continued success and growth of the invati line of products and the new and reformulated dry remedy line of products from aveda which contributed approximately 25 million combined to the increase the category benefited from sales generated from expanded global distribution of aveda products to salons and in the travel retail channel and bumble and bumble products to specialty multibrand retailers partially offsetting these increases were lower sales of ojon products the decrease in ojon net sales was primarily due to the exit of that business from the direct response television channel in our fiscal 2014 second quarter excluding the impact of foreign currency translation hair care net sales increased 6 the impact of the accelerated orders on the change in reported net sales in hair care was de minimis 

  

geographic regions

 33  

  

net sales in the americas increased 6 or 2694 million to 45723 million primarily reflecting higher net sales in the united states of approximately 231 million including the 84 million in accelerated orders this growth primarily reflected new collections from our makeup artist brands higher sales of prestige products from our luxury brands the continued expansion of smashbox at specialty multibrand retailers and department stores contributions from new product innovations from certain of our heritage brands fiscal 2014 launches from certain of our designer fragrances and expansion into new retail channels by certain of our hair care brands net sales in latin america increased approximately 24 million led by venezuela and brazil the net sales increase in venezuela was primarily due to price increases as a result of rising inflation net sales in canada increased approximately 15 million excluding the impact of foreign currency translation the americas net sales increased 7 adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders reported net sales in the americas would have increased 4 

  

in europe the middle east  africa net sales increased 11 or 4050 million to 41637 million primarily reflecting higher sales from our travel retail business the united kingdom germany and france of approximately 335 million combined the net sales increase in our travel retail business primarily reflected the success of fiscal 2014 launch initiatives an increase in global airline passenger traffic and expanded distribution as well as the impact of the accelerated orders this was despite a slowdown at retail in part due to an adverse impact of chinese government actions on the travel and spending of chinese consumers higher sales in the united kingdom and france were primarily driven by certain of our makeup artist and luxury brands the net sales increase in germany was primarily driven by our makeup artist and certain of our heritage brands these increases were partially offset by lower net sales in south africa and india of approximately 7 million combined driven by the weakening of their respective currencies excluding the impact of foreign currency translation europe the middle east  africa net sales increased 9 adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders reported net sales in europe the middle east  africa would have increased 9 

  

net sales in asiapacific increased 5 or 1111 million to 22327 million primarily reflecting higher sales in china and hong kong of approximately 119 million combined higher sales in china were primarily driven by expanded distribution the net sales increase in hong kong was primarily due to higher net sales from certain of our heritage and luxury brands these increases were partially offset by lower net sales in japan and australia of approximately 17 million combined the declines in japan and australia were driven by the weakening of their respective currencies which more than offset an improvement in their local retail environments and the impact of the accelerated orders in japan excluding the impact of foreign currency translation asiapacific net sales increased 9 adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders reported net sales in asiapacific would have increased 4 

  

we strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market which may account for differences in regional sales growth 

  

cost of sales 

  

cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales decreased to 197 as compared with 199 in fiscal 2013 cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales reflected strategic changes in pricing and the mix of our business of approximately 30 basis points and favorable manufacturing variances of approximately 10 basis points partially offsetting these changes were an increase in obsolescence charges and the unfavorable effect of exchange rates of approximately 10 basis points each 

  

operating expenses 

  

operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 636 as compared with 651 in fiscal 2013 as a percentage of net sales this decrease primarily reflected lower spending on advertising merchandising and sampling of approximately 110 basis points lower selling costs of approximately 50 basis points and a favorable comparison to fiscal 2013 which reflected restructuring goodwill and other impairment charges of approximately 40 basis points combined these improvements were partially offset by a charge in fiscal 2014 to remeasure net monetary assets in venezuela of approximately 30 basis points and unfavorable changes in foreign exchange transactions of approximately 10 basis points adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders in fiscal 2014 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales would have decreased 50 basis points primarily reflecting lower spending on advertising merchandising and sampling and lower selling costs 

  

changes in advertising merchandising and sampling spending result from the type timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts as well as the markets and brands being emphasized 

  

operating results 

  

operating income increased 20 or 3016 million to 18276 million and operating margin increased to 167 of net sales as compared with 150 in fiscal 2013 which primarily reflected our lower operating expense margin and to a lesser extent our higher gross margin the overall operating results were also impacted by approximately 127 million related to the accelerated orders in fiscal 2014 as discussed above which created a favorable comparison to fiscal 2013 partially offset by the fiscal 2014 remeasurement of net monetary assets in venezuela of 383 million the following discussions of operating results by product categories and geographic regions exclude the impact of total charges adjustments associated with restructuring activities of 29 million or less than 1 of net sales for fiscal 2014 and 178 million or less than 1 of net sales for fiscal 2013 we believe the following analysis of operating results better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders in fiscal 2014 and charges adjustments associated with restructuring activities operating income would have increased 10 and operating margin would have increased 50 basis points

product categories 

the overall change in operating results in each product category benefited from the accelerated orders during fiscal 2014 as discussed above as follows skin care approximately 72 million makeup approximately 41 million fragrance approximately 14 million and the impact on hair care was de minimis 

  

skin care operating income increased 18 or 1457 million to 9758 million primarily reflecting higher results driven by fiscal 2014 product launches from estée lauder and clinique and higher sales of luxury skin care products makeup operating income increased 23 or 1355 million to 7159 million primarily reflecting improved results from our makeup artist brands and certain of our heritage brands attributable to growth in net sales we reallocated our investment spending among brands and media formats which positively impacted operating income in the skin care and makeup product categories fragrance operating income decreased 13 or 162 million to 1041 million primarily reflecting higher investment spending behind fiscal 2014 major launches partially offset by higher results from our luxury brands the fiscal 2014 remeasurement of net monetary assets in venezuela impacted the skin care makeup and fragrance product categories by 12 million 16 million and 10 million respectively hair care operating results increased 26 or 70 million to 337 million primarily reflecting higher results from aveda and strategic reductions in spending behind ojon products adjusting for the accelerated orders operating income in the skin care makeup fragrance and hair care product categories would have increased decreased 9 16 25 and 26 respectively 

  

geographic regions 

the overall change in operating results in each geographic region benefited as a result of the accelerated orders during fiscal 2014 as discussed above as follows americas approximately 53 million europe the middle east  africa approximately 53 million and asiapacific approximately 21 million 

  

operating income in the americas increased 27 or 1141 million to 5373 million primarily reflecting the increase in net sales as previously discussed as well as a more measured approach to spending these improvements were partially offset by the fiscal 2014 remeasurement of net monetary assets in venezuela adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders operating income in the americas would have increased 14 

  

in europe the middle east  africa operating income increased 15 or 1249 million to 9383 million higher results from our travel retail business and in the united kingdom totaled approximately 126 million combined primarily reflecting higher sales the higher results in our travel retail business also reflected the impact of the accelerated orders these improvements were partially offset by lower operating results in france and the middle east of approximately 10 million combined the lower results in france were due to higher spending on advertising merchandising and sampling adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders operating income in europe the middle east  africa would have increased 9 

  

in asiapacific operating income increased 14 or 419 million to 3491 million higher results in korea japan and hong kong totaled approximately 45 million combined the higher results in korea were due to lower spending on advertising merchandising and sampling and the higher results in japan primarily reflected the impact of the accelerated orders the higher results in the region were partially offset by lower operating results of approximately 11 million in china and thailand combined the lower results from china were primarily driven by an increase in investment spending as a result of new product introductions and increased distribution adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders operating income in asiapacific would have increased 7 

  

interest expense 

  

interest expense decreased to 594 million as compared with 631 million in fiscal 2013 primarily due to the refinancing of debt at lower rates in fiscal 2013 

  

interest expense on debt extinguishment 

  

during the first quarter of fiscal 2013 we redeemed the 2301 million principal amount of our 775 senior notes due 2013 at a price of 108 of the principal amount we recorded a pretax expense on the extinguishment of debt of 191 million representing the call premium of 186 million and the prorata writeoff of 05 million of issuance costs and debt discount 

  

interest income and investment income net 

  

interest income and investment income net increased to 86 million which remained relatively unchanged compared with 83 million in fiscal 2013 

  

other income 

  

we recognized 231 million as other income during fiscal 2013 primarily reflecting the amended agreement related to the august 2007 sale of rodan  fields a brand then owned by us 

  

 35  

  

provision for income taxes 

  

the provision for income taxes represents us federal foreign state and local income taxes the effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state and local income taxes the taxation of foreign income and income tax reserve adjustments which represent changes in our net liability for unrecognized tax benefits including tax settlements and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations our effective tax rate will change from year to year based on recurring and nonrecurring factors including but not limited to the geographical mix of earnings enacted tax legislation state and local income taxes tax reserve adjustments the ultimate disposition of deferred tax assets relating to stockbased compensation and the interaction of various global tax strategies in addition changes in judgment from the evaluation of new information resulting in the recognition derecognition or remeasurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period are recognized separately in the period of change 

  

the effective rate for income taxes was 320 and 306 for fiscal 2014 and 2013 respectively the increase in the rate of 140 basis points was principally attributable to a higher effective tax rate related to the company’s foreign operations which included the impact of the venezuela remeasurement charge for which no tax benefit has been provided as well as slightly higher favorable income tax reserve adjustments recorded in fiscal 2013 

  

net earnings attributable to the estÉe lauder companies inc 

  

net earnings attributable to the estée lauder companies inc as compared with fiscal 2013 increased 18 or 1843 million to 12041 million and diluted net earnings per common share increased 19 from 258 to 306 

  

nongaap financial measures 

  

we use certain nongaap financial measures among other financial measures to evaluate our operating performance which represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business management believes that excluding these items that are not comparable from period to period helps investors and others compare operating performance between two periods while we consider the nongaap measures useful in analyzing our results they are not intended to replace or act as a substitute for any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with us gaap the following tables present net sales operating income and diluted net earnings per common share adjusted to exclude the impact of accelerated orders associated with the july 2014 smi rollout the venezuela fiscal 2014 remeasurement charge returns and charges adjustments associated with restructuring activities and the fiscal 2013 interest expense on debt extinguishment the tables provide reconciliations between these nongaap financial measures and the most directly comparable us gaap measures

financial condition 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

overview 

  

our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program borrowings from the issuance of longterm debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks and other lenders in the united states and abroad at june 30 2015 we had cash and cash equivalents of 10214 million compared with 16291 million at june 30 2014 our cash and cash equivalents are maintained at a number of financial institutions to mitigate the risk of uninsured balances we select financial institutions based on their credit ratings and financial strength and perform ongoing evaluations of these institutions to limit our concentration risk exposure 

  

the decline in cash balances reflects the change in our cash investment strategy that we implemented in the fiscal 2015 second quarter to invest a portion of our cash and cash equivalents in short and longterm investments our investment objectives include capital preservation maintaining adequate liquidity asset diversification and achieving appropriate returns within the guidelines set forth in our investment policy these investments are classified as availableforsale and totaled 9178 million at june 30 2015 

  

during fiscal 2015 we acquired rodin olio lusso a skin care brand le labo a fragrance brand editions de parfums frédéric malle a fragrance brand and glamglow a skin care brand the purchase price related to each of these acquisitions includes cash paid at closing plus additional amounts to be paid in the future a portion of which is contingent on the achievement of certain future operating results the amounts paid at closing amounting to 2372 million were funded by cash on hand and through the issuance of commercial paper the additional amounts are expected to be paid from fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2020 with the exception of working capital adjustments that were paid during fiscal 2015 and additional working capital adjustments and a purchase price trueup payment that are expected to be paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 the aggregate acquisitiondate fair value of these transactions was approximately 437 million

  

our business is seasonal in nature and accordingly our working capital needs vary from time to time we may enter into investing and financing transactions that require additional funding to the extent that these needs exceed cash from operations we could subject to market conditions issue commercial paper issue longterm debt securities or borrow under our revolving credit facilities 

  

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that cash on hand cash generated from operations available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business operations information systems enhancements capital expenditures potential stock repurchases commitments and other contractual obligations on both a nearterm and longterm basis our cash and cash equivalents and short and longterm investment balances at june 30 2015 include approximately 1694 million of cash and short and longterm investments in offshore jurisdictions associated with our permanent reinvestment strategy we do not believe that the indefinite reinvestment of these funds offshore impairs our ability to meet our domestic debt or working capital obligations if these indefinitely reinvested earnings were repatriated into the united states as dividends we would be subject to additional taxes 

  

the effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years generally we have been able to introduce new products at higher prices increase prices and implement other operating efficiencies to sufficiently offset cost increases which have been moderate 

  

credit ratings 

  

changes in our credit ratings will likely result in changes in our borrowing costs our credit ratings also impact the cost of our revolving credit facility as discussed below downgrades in our credit ratings may reduce our ability to issue commercial paper andor longterm debt and would likely increase the relative costs of borrowing a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating as of august 14 2015 our commercial paper is rated a1 by standard  poor’s and p1 by moody’s and our longterm debt is rated a with a stable outlook by standard  poor’s and a2 with a stable outlook by moody’s

debt 

  

at june 30 2015 our outstanding borrowings were as follows

2   consists of 2500 million principal and unamortized debt discount of 10 million 

3   consists of 3000 million principal and unamortized debt discount of 34 million 

4   consists of 2000 million principal and unamortized debt discount of 21 million 

5   consists of 2500 million principal unamortized debt discount of 02 million and a 02 million adjustment to reflect the fair value of interest rate swaps 

6   consists of 3000 million principal unamortized debt discount of 01 million and a 140 million adjustment to reflect the termination value of interest rate swaps 

7   the senior notes contain certain customary incurrence—based covenants including limitations on indebtedness secured by liens 

  

in june 2015 we issued the 2045 senior notes in a public offering priced at 97999 with a yield of 4497 interest payments are required to be made semiannually on june 15 th and december 15 th  for further information see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data — note 10 — debt ”

  

we have a 10 billion commercial paper program under which we may issue commercial paper in the united states as of june 30 2015 we had no commercial paper outstanding at august 14 2015 we had 2200 million of commercial paper outstanding which we may refinance on a periodic basis as it matures at thenprevailing market interest rates 

  

we have a 10 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility the “facility” that we extended by one year and is currently set to expire on july 15 2020 we have a remaining option to extend the facility one more year at june 30 2015 no borrowings were outstanding under the facility the facility may be used for general corporate purposes up to the equivalent of 350 million of the facility is available for multicurrency loans the interest rate on borrowings under the facility is based on libor or on the higher of prime which is the rate of interest publicly announced by the administrative agent or ½ plus the federal funds rate we incurred costs of approximately 10 million to establish the facility which costs are being amortized over the term of the facility the facility has an annual fee of 06 million payable quarterly based on our current credit ratings the facility also contains a crossdefault provision whereby a failure to pay other material financial obligations in excess of 1500 million after grace periods and absent a waiver from the lenders would result in an event of default and the acceleration of the maturity of any outstanding debt under the facility

  

total debt as a percent of total capitalization excluding noncontrolling interests increased to 31 at june 30 2015 from 26 at june 30 2014 primarily due to the issuance of the 2045 senior notes 

  

cash flows 

  

net cash provided by operating activities was 19433 million 15352 million and 12263 million in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively the fiscal 2015 increase in cash flows provided by operating activities as compared with fiscal 2014 primarily reflected a favorable change in accounts receivable reflecting the timing of shipments and improved collections a favorable change in inventory reflecting our initiative to better align supply levels with forecasted demand and other supply chain improvements and a favorable change in accounts payable primarily due to the timing of payments the accelerated orders in connection with our july 2014 smi implementation also contributed to the favorable changes in these working capital components and the decrease in net earnings as compared to fiscal 2014 the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities during fiscal 2014 as compared with fiscal 2013 was primarily driven by an increase in net earnings an increase in accrued income taxes as a result of the level and timing of tax payments and an increase in accounts payable primarily due to the timing of payments these changes were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable which primarily reflected accelerated orders in connection with our july 2014 smi implementation 

  

 38  

  

net cash used for investing activities was 16162 million 5116 million and 4655 million in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively the fiscal 2015 increase as compared with fiscal 2014 primarily reflected purchases of investments in connection with the implementation of our cash investment strategy as previously discussed also contributing to the increase was cash paid in connection with the acquisitions of rodin olio lusso le labo editions de parfums frédéric malle and glamglow partially offsetting cash used for investing activities were proceeds from the disposition of investments and to a lesser extent lower capital expenditure activity the increase in cash flows used for investing activities during fiscal 2014 as compared with fiscal 2013 primarily reflected higher capital expenditure activity related to leasehold improvements and counters

  

net cash used for financing activities was 8948 million 8569 million and 6115 million in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively the fiscal 2015 increase in cash used for financing activities as compared with fiscal 2014 primarily reflected an increase in treasury stock purchases and higher dividend payments partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of the 2045 senior notes the increase in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2014 as compared with fiscal 2013 primarily reflected an increase in treasury stock purchases which were partially offset by lower dividend payments that resulted from the transition to quarterly dividends in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 and the final annual dividend payment made that year in addition fiscal 2013 reflected the proceeds from the issuance of the 2022 senior notes and 2042 senior notes which was partially offset by the redemption of the 2013 senior notes and repayment of commercial paper 

  

dividends 

  

for a summary of quarterly cash dividends declared per share on our class a and class b common stock during the year ended june 30 2015 see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data — note 15 — common stock ”

  

pension and postretirement plan funding 

  

several factors influence the annual funding requirements for our pension plans for the us qualified plan we seek to maintain appropriate funded percentages for any future contributions to the us qualified plan we would seek to contribute an amount or amounts that would not be less than the minimum required by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended “erisa” and subsequent pension legislation and would not be more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes for each international plan our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations in addition amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions as detailed in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — critical accounting policies and estimates ” the effect of our pension plan funding on future operating results will depend on economic conditions employee demographics mortality rates the number of participants electing to take lumpsum distributions investment performance and funding decisions 

  

for the us qualified plan we maintain an investment strategy of matching the duration of a substantial portion of the plan assets with the duration of the underlying plan liabilities this strategy assists us in maintaining our overall funded ratio during fiscal 2015 we made a cash contribution to the us qualified plan of 250 million for fiscal 2015 and 2014 we met or exceeded all contribution requirements under erisa regulations for the us qualified plan as we continue to monitor the funded status we may decide to make cash contributions to the us qualified plan or our postretirement medical plan in the united states during fiscal 2016 

  

for fiscal 2015 and 2014 we made benefit payments under our nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan of 49 million and 72 million respectively we expect to make benefit payments under this plan during fiscal 2016 of approximately 15 million for fiscal 2015 and 2014 we made benefit payments under our postretirement plans of 63 million and 62 million respectively we expect to make benefit payments under these plans during fiscal 2016 of approximately 6 million for fiscal 2015 and 2014 we made cash contributions to our international defined benefit pension plans of 228 million and 279 million respectively we expect to make contributions under these plans during fiscal 2016 of approximately 23 million 

  

commitments and contingencies 

  

certain of our business acquisition agreements include contingent consideration or “earnout” provisions these provisions generally require that we pay to the seller or sellers of the business additional amounts based on the performance of the acquired business since the size of each payment depends upon performance of the acquired business we do not expect that such payments will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or financial condition 

  

for additional contingencies refer to “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data — note 14 — commitments and contingencies contractual obligations ”

for a discussion of credit risk see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data — note 11 — derivative financial instruments credit risk ” 

  

market risk 

  

we use a valueatrisk model to assess the market risk of our derivative financial instruments valueatrisk represents the potential losses for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors for a specified time period and confidence level we estimate valueatrisk across all of our derivative financial instruments using a model with historical volatilities and correlations calculated over the past 250day period the high low and average measured valueatrisk during fiscal 2015 and 2014 related to our derivative financial instruments is as follows 

  

   

the model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 percent confidence level we used a statistical simulation model that valued our derivative financial instruments against one thousand randomly generated market price paths 

our calculated valueatrisk exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may or may not occur it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated based upon actual fluctuations in market rates operating exposures and the timing thereof and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year we believe however that any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the derivative financial instrument was intended 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

we do not maintain any offbalance sheet arrangements transactions obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities other than operating leases that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations

we are continually benchmarking the performance of the supply chain and will change suppliers and adjust our distribution networks and manufacturing footprint based upon the changing needs of the business as we integrate acquired brands we continually seek new ways to leverage our production and sourcing capabilities to improve our overall supply chain performance

 item 1a risk factors 

  

there are risks associated with an investment in our securities 

  

please consider the following risks and all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k and in our subsequent filings with the securities and exchange commission “sec” our business may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial if any of the events contemplated by the following discussion of risks should occur or other risks arise or develop our business prospects financial condition and results of operations as well as the trading prices of our securities may be adversely affected 

  

the beauty business is highly competitive and if we are unable to compete effectively our results will suffer 

  

we face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world including multinational consumer product companies some of these competitors have greater resources than we do and may be able to respond to changing business and economic conditions more quickly than us competition in the beauty business is based on pricing of products innovation perceived value service to the consumer promotional activities advertising special events new product introductions ecommerce and mcommerce initiatives and other activities it is difficult for us to predict the timing and scale of our competitors’ actions in these areas a consolidation in the retail trade may result in us becoming increasingly dependent on key retailers this could result in an increased risk related to the concentration of our customers a severe adverse impact on the business operations of our customers could have a corresponding material adverse effect on us our ability to compete also depends on the continued strength of our brands our ability to attract and retain key talent and other personnel the efficiency of our manufacturing facilities and distribution network and our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property and those other rights used in our business in addition certain of our key retailers around the world market and sell competing brands or are owned or otherwise affiliated with companies that market and sell competing brands our inability to continue to compete effectively in key countries around the world could have an adverse impact on our business 

  

  

our inability to anticipate and respond to market trends and changes in consumer preferences could adversely affect our financial results 

  

our continued success depends on our ability to anticipate gauge and react in a timely and costeffective manner to changes in consumer tastes for skin care makeup fragrance and hair care products attitudes toward our industry and brands as well as to where and how consumers shop for those products we must continually work to develop manufacture and market new products maintain and adapt our “hightouch” services to existing and emerging distribution channels maintain and enhance the recognition of our brands achieve a favorable mix of products successfully manage our inventories and refine our approach as to how and where we market and sell our products while we devote considerable effort and resources to shape analyze and respond to consumer preferences we recognize that consumer tastes cannot be predicted with certainty and can change rapidly the issue is compounded by the increasing use of social and digital media by consumers and the speed by which information and opinions are shared if we are unable to anticipate and respond to sudden challenges that we may face in the marketplace trends in the market for our products and changing consumer demands and sentiment our financial results will suffer 

  

our future success depends on our ability to achieve our longterm strategy 

  

achieving our longterm strategy will require investment in new capabilities brands categories distribution channels technologies and emerging and more mature geographic markets these investments may result in shortterm costs without any current revenues and therefore may be dilutive to our earnings at least in the short term in addition we may dispose of or discontinue select brands or streamline operations and incur costs or restructuring and other charges in doing so although we believe that our strategy will lead to longterm growth in revenue and profitability we may not realize in full or in part the anticipated benefits the failure to realize benefits which may be due to our inability to execute plans global or local economic conditions competition changes in the beauty industry and the other risks described herein could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

acquisitions may expose us to additional risks 

  

we continuously review acquisition and investment opportunities that would expand our current product offerings our distribution channels increase the size and geographic scope of our operations or otherwise offer growth and operating efficiency opportunities there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate these transactions on favorable terms if required the financing for these transactions could result in an increase in our indebtedness dilute the interests of our stockholders or both acquisitions including strategic investments or alliances entail numerous risks which may include 

  

·   difficulties in assimilating acquired operations or products including the loss of key employees from or customers of acquired businesses 

·   diversion of management’s attention from our existing businesses 

·   adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and 

·   risks of entering distribution channels categories or markets in which we have limited or no prior experience 

  

our failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business and any adverse consequences associated with our acquisition activities could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

  

completed acquisitions typically result in additional goodwill andor an increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet we are required at least annually or as facts and circumstances exist to test goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to determine if impairment has occurred if the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the fair value of other intangible assets with indefinite lives in the period the determination is made we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

  

a general economic downturn or sudden disruption in business conditions may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items andor the financial strength of our customers that are retailers which could adversely affect our financial results 

  

the general level of consumer spending is affected by a number of factors including general economic conditions inflation interest rates energy costs and consumer confidence generally all of which are beyond our control consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower and may impact sales of our products a decline in consumer purchases of discretionary items also tends to impact our customers that are retailers we generally extend credit to a retailer based on an evaluation of its financial condition usually without requiring collateral however the financial difficulties of a retailer could cause us to curtail or eliminate business with that customer we may also assume more credit risk relating to the receivables from that retailer our inability to collect the receivable from one of our largest customers or from a group of customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition if a retailer was to liquidate we may incur additional costs if we choose to purchase the retailer’s inventory of our products to protect brand equity 

  

in addition sudden disruptions in business conditions for example as a consequence of events such as a pandemic or local or international conflicts around the world or as a result of a terrorist attack retaliation and the threat of further attacks or retaliation or as a result of adverse weather conditions or climate changes or seismic events can have a shortterm and sometimes longterm impact on consumer spending 

  

events that impact consumers’ willingness or ability to travel andor purchase our products while traveling may impact our business including travel retail a significant contributor to our overall results and our strategy to market and sell products to international travelers at their destinations 

  

a downturn in the economies of or continuing recessions in the countries where we sell our products or a sudden disruption of business conditions in those countries could adversely affect consumer confidence the financial strength of our retailers and our sales and profitability we are seeing continued softness in certain southern european countries and korea due to challenging economic environments as well as intensifying competitive pressures globally elsewhere we are cautious of an uncertain retail environment in the united states in the short term unfavorable foreign exchange rates in certain emerging countries and the lower growth rates we have been experiencing in china we also continue to see an adverse impact of chinese government actions on the travel and spending of chinese consumers which are affecting sales in the travel retail channel at their travel destinations and within their home market 

  

volatility in the financial markets and a related economic downturn in key markets or markets generally throughout the world could have a material adverse effect on our business while we currently generate significant cash flows from our ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities credit markets may experience significant disruptions deterioration in global financial markets or an adverse change in our credit ratings could make future financing difficult or more expensive if any financial institutions that are parties to our undrawn revolving credit facility or other financing arrangements such as foreign exchange or interest rate hedging instruments were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us this could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain foreign currency or interest rate exposures which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

changes in laws regulations and policies that affect our business could adversely affect our financial results 

  

our business is subject to numerous laws regulations and policies changes in the laws regulations and policies including the interpretation or enforcement thereof that affect or will affect our business including changes in accounting standards tax laws and regulations laws and regulations relating to data privacy anticorruption advertising marketing manufacturing distribution product registration ingredients chemicals and packaging laws in europe and elsewhere relating to selective distribution environmental or climate change laws regulations or accords trade rules and customs regulations and the outcome and expense of legal or regulatory proceedings and any action we may take as a result could adversely affect our financial results 

  

we are involved and may become involved in the future in disputes and other legal or regulatory proceedings that if adversely decided or settled could adversely affect our financial results 

  

we are and may in the future become party to litigation other disputes or regulatory proceedings in general claims made by us or against us in litigation disputes or other proceedings can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements injunctions or damages that could significantly affect our business or financial results we are currently vigorously contesting certain of these claims however it is not possible to predict the final resolution of the litigation disputes or proceedings to which we currently are or may in the future become party to and the impact of certain of these matters on our business results of operations and financial condition could be material 

  

  

government reviews inquiries investigations and actions could harm our business or reputation 

  

as we operate in various locations around the world our operations in certain countries are subject to significant governmental scrutiny and may be adversely impacted by the results of such scrutiny the regulatory environment with regard to our business is evolving and officials often exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply applicable regulations from time to time we may receive formal and informal inquiries from various government regulatory authorities as well as selfregulatory organizations about our business and compliance with local laws regulations or standards any determination that our operations or activities or the activities of our employees are not in compliance with existing laws regulations or standards could result in the imposition of substantial fines interruptions of business loss of supplier vendor or other thirdparty relationships termination of necessary licenses and permits or similar results all of which could potentially harm our business andor reputation even if an inquiry does not result in these types of determinations it potentially could create negative publicity which could harm our business andor reputation 

  

our success depends in part on the quality efficacy and safety of our products 

  

our success depends in part on the quality efficacy and safety of our products if our products are found to be defective or unsafe our product claims are found to be deceptive or our products otherwise fail to meet our consumers’ expectations our relationships with customers or consumers could suffer the appeal of one or more of our brands could be diminished and we could lose sales andor become subject to liability or claims any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

our success depends in part on our key personnel 

  

our success depends in part on our ability to retain our key personnel including our executive officers and senior management team the unexpected loss of one or more of our key employees could adversely affect our business our success also depends in part on our continuing ability to identify hire train and retain other highly qualified personnel competition for these employees can be intense we may not be able to attract assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business this risk may be exacerbated by the stresses associated with the implementation of our strategic plan and other initiatives 

  

we are subject to risks related to our foreign operations 

  

we operate on a global basis with a majority of our fiscal 2014 net sales and operating income generated outside the united states 

  

we intend to reinvest these earnings in our foreign operations indefinitely except where we are able to repatriate these earnings to the united states without material incremental tax provision a significant portion of our cash and cash equivalents that result from these earnings remain outside the united states if these indefinitely reinvested earnings were repatriated into the united states as dividends we would be subject to additional taxes 

  

we maintain offices in over 50 countries and have key operational facilities located outside the united states that manufacture warehouse or distribute goods for sale throughout the world foreign operations are subject to many risks and uncertainties including 

  

·   fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which can affect our results of operations the value of our foreign assets the relative prices at which we and foreign competitors sell products in the same markets and the cost of certain inventory and noninventory items required in our operations 

  

·   foreign laws regulations and policies including restrictions on trade import and export license requirements and tariffs and taxes as well as united states laws and regulations relating to foreign trade operations and investment 

  

·   lack of wellestablished or reliable legal and administrative systems in certain countries in which we operate and 

  

·   adverse weather conditions currency exchange controls and social economic and geopolitical conditions such as terrorist attacks war or other military action 

  

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects reputation results of operations and financial condition 

  

a disruption in operations or our supply chain could adversely affect our business and financial results 

  

as a company engaged in manufacturing and distribution on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including industrial accidents environmental events strikes and other labor disputes disruptions in supply chain or information systems loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites or suppliers product quality control safety increase in commodity prices and energy costs licensing requirements and other regulatory issues as well as natural disasters and other external factors over which we have no control if such an event were to occur it could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

  

  

we use a wide variety of direct and indirect suppliers of goods and services from around the world some of our products rely on single or a limited number of suppliers changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers could subject us to losses or adversely affect our ability to bring products to market further the failure of our suppliers to deliver goods and services in sufficient quantities in compliance with applicable standards and in a timely manner could adversely affect our customer service levels and overall business in addition any increases in the costs of goods and services for our business may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies in our operations 

  

our information systems and websites may be susceptible to cybersecurity breaches outages and other risks 

  

we have information systems that support our business processes including product development marketing sales order processing production distribution finance and intracompany communications throughout the world we have ecommerce mcommerce and other internet websites in the united states and many other countries these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire floods power loss telecommunications failures breakins and similar events despite the implementation of network security measures our systems may be vulnerable to cybersecurity breaches such as computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering the occurrence of these or other events could disrupt or damage our information systems and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

failure to adequately maintain the security of our electronic and other confidential information could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

  

we are dependent upon automated information technology processes as part of our normal business activities we collect and store certain information that is confidential proprietary or otherwise sensitive including personal information with respect to customers and employees we may share some of this information with vendors who assist us with certain aspects of our business moreover the success of our ecommerce and mcommerce operations depends upon the secure transmission of confidential and personal data over public networks including the use of cashless payments any failure on the part of us or our vendors to maintain the security of our confidential data and our employees’ and customers’ personal information including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information could result in business disruption damage to our reputation financial obligations to third parties fines penalties regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs and also result in deterioration in our employees’ and customers’ confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages and thus could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to enhance our information security systems and could result in a disruption to our operations 

  

we are subject to risks associated with implementing global information systems 

  

as part of our strategic modern initiative “smi” we are implementing enterprisewide global programs intended to deliver a single set of integrated data processes and technologies which would be scalable and used to standardize business processes across brands regions and functions we are also implementing other systems including global human resource management systems and retail operating systems like most entitywide changes to software systems the implementation of smi and other systems involve risks and uncertainties failure to implement smi and other systems as planned in terms of timing specifications andor costs could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

  

as we outsource functions we become more dependent on the entities performing those functions 

  

as part of our longterm strategy we are continually looking for opportunities to provide essential business services in a more costeffective manner in some cases this requires the outsourcing of functions or parts of functions that can be performed more effectively by external service providers these include certain information systems functions such as information technology operations and certain human resource functions such as employee benefit plan administration while we believe we conduct appropriate due diligence before entering into agreements with the outsourcing entity the failure of one or more entities to provide the expected services provide them on a timely basis or to provide them at the prices we expect may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

  

  

the trading prices of our securities periodically may rise or fall based on the accuracy of predictions of our earnings or other financial performance 

  

our business planning process is designed to maximize our longterm strength growth and profitability not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter we believe that this longerterm focus is in the best interests of the company and our stockholders at the same time however we recognize that it may be helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our forecast of net sales earnings per share and other financial metrics or projections accordingly when we announced our yearend financial results for fiscal 2014 we provided guidance as to a number of assumptions including our expected net sales and earnings per share for the quarter ending september 30 2014 and the fiscal year ending june 30 2015 while we generally expect to provide updates to our guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter we assume no responsibility to update any of our forwardlooking statements at such times or otherwise in addition the longerterm guidance we provide is based on goals that we believe at the time guidance is given are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years such targets are more difficult to predict than our current quarter and fiscal year expectations 

  

in all of our public statements when we make or update a forwardlooking statement about our net sales andor earnings expectations or expectations regarding restructuring or other initiatives we accompany such statements directly or by reference to a public document with a list of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we expect such a list is included among other places in our earnings press release and in our periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission eg in our reports on form 10k and form 10q these and other factors may make it difficult for us and for outside observers such as research analysts to predict what our earnings will be in any given fiscal quarter or year 

  

outside analysts and investors have the right to make their own predictions of our financial results for any future period outside analysts however have access to no more material information about our results or plans than any other public investor and we do not endorse their predictions as to our future performance nor do we assume any responsibility to correct the predictions of outside analysts or others when they differ from our own internal expectations if and when we announce actual results that differ from those that outside analysts or others have been predicting the market price of our securities could be affected investors who rely on the predictions of outside analysts or others when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk we take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in the prices of our securities 

  

we are controlled by the lauder family as a result of their control of us the lauder family has the ability to prevent or cause a change in control or approve prevent or influence certain actions by us 

  

as of august 14 2014 members of the lauder family beneficially own directly or indirectly shares of the company’s class a common stock with one vote per share and class b common stock with 10 votes per share having 867 of the outstanding voting power of the common stock in addition there are four members of the lauder family who are employees including three who are members of our board of directors another family member is on our board and is a party to a consulting agreement and a license agreement with us as a result of the stock ownership and their positions at the company the lauder family has the ability to exercise significant control and influence over our business including without limitation all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors amendments to the certificate of incorporation and significant corporate transactions such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets for the foreseeable future 

  

we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the new york stock exchange rules and as a result are relying on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that are designed to provide protection to stockholders of companies that are not “controlled companies” 

  

the lauder family and their related entities own more than 50 of the total voting power of our common shares and as a result we are a “controlled company” under the new york stock exchange corporate governance standards as a controlled company we are exempt under the new york stock exchange standards from the obligation to comply with certain new york stock exchange corporate governance requirements including the requirements 

  

·   that a majority of our board of directors consists of independent directors 

·   that we have a nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities and 

·   that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities 

  

while we have voluntarily caused our board to have a majority of independent directors and the written charters of our nominating and board affairs committee and the compensation committee to have the required provisions we are not requiring our nominating and board affairs committee and compensation committee to be comprised solely of independent directors as a result of our use of the “controlled company” exemptions investors will not have the same protection afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the new york stock exchange corporate governance requirements

we expect to continue the payment of cash dividends in the future but there can be no assurance that the board of directors will continue to declare them we transitioned to a quarterly dividend payout schedule for our class a and class b common stock beginning in the fiscal 2013 third quarter accordingly the total cash dividends per share in fiscal 2013 is equivalent to six quarterly dividends as a result the total value of cash dividends per share paid in fiscal 2014 was lower than the dividends per share paid in fiscal 2013 on august 14 2014 a dividend was declared in the amount of 20 per share on our class a and class b common stock the dividend is payable in cash on september 15 2014 to stockholders of record at the close of business on august 29 2014

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition at june 30 2014 and our results of operations for the three fiscal years ended june 30 2014 are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements these estimates and assumptions can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates we consider accounting estimates to be critical if both i the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and ii the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to the company’s financial condition our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition inventory pension and other postretirement benefit costs goodwill other intangible assets and longlived assets and income taxes 

  

management of the company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of the company’s board of directors 

  

revenue recognition 

revenues from product sales are recognized upon transfer of ownership including passage of title to the customer and transfer of the risk of loss related to those goods in the americas region sales are generally recognized at the time the product is shipped to the customer and in the europe the middle east  africa and asiapacific regions sales are generally recognized based upon the customer’s receipt in certain circumstances transfer of title takes place at the point of sale for example at our retail stores 

  

revenues are reported on a net sales basis which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual product returns received discounts incentive arrangements with retailers and an amount established for anticipated product returns our practice is to accept product returns from retailers only if properly requested authorized and approved in accepting returns we typically provide a credit to the retailer against accounts receivable from that retailer as a percentage of gross sales returns were 34 in fiscal 2014 33 in fiscal 2013 and 35 in fiscal 2012 

  

our sales return accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net sales this accrual is calculated based on a history of actual returns estimated future returns and information provided by retailers regarding their inventory levels consideration of these factors results in an accrual for anticipated sales returns that reflects increases or decreases related to seasonal fluctuations experience has shown a relationship between retailer inventory levels and sales returns in the subsequent period as well as a consistent pattern of returns due to the seasonal nature of our business in addition as necessary specific accruals may be established for significant future known or anticipated events the types of known or anticipated events that we have considered and will continue to consider include but are not limited to the financial condition of our customers store closings by retailers changes in the retail environment and our decision to continue to support new and existing products 

  

in the ordinary course of business we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions based upon the evaluation of accounts receivable aging specific exposures and historical trends our allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net earnings the allowance for doubtful accounts was 239 million and 227 million as of june 30 2014 and 2013 respectively the allowance for doubtful accounts was reduced by 83 million 230 million and 138 million for customer deductions and writeoffs in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively and increased by 95 million 146 million and 110 million for additional provisions in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

  

inventory 

we state our inventory at the lower of cost or fairmarket value with cost being based on standard cost which approximates actual cost on the firstin firstout fifo method we believe this method most closely matches the flow of our products from manufacture through sale the reported net value of our inventory includes saleable products promotional products raw materials and componentry and work in process that will be sold or used in future periods inventory cost includes raw materials direct labor and overhead as well as inbound freight manufacturing overhead is allocated to the cost of inventory based on the normal production capacity unallocated overhead during periods of abnormally low production levels are recognized as cost of sales in the period in which they are incurred 

  

we also record an inventory obsolescence reserve which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated realizable value based on various product sales projections this reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales in addition and as necessary we may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events

pension and other postretirement benefit costs 

we offer the following benefits to some or all of our employees a domestic trustbased noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan “us qualified plan” and an unfunded nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations collectively with the us qualified plan the “domestic plans” a domestic contributory defined contribution plan international pension plans which vary by country consisting of both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans deferred compensation arrangements and certain other postretirement benefit plans 

  

the amounts needed to fund future payouts under our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans are subject to numerous assumptions and variables certain significant variables require us to make assumptions that are within our control such as an anticipated discount rate expected rate of return on plan assets and future compensation levels we evaluate these assumptions with our actuarial advisors and select assumptions that we believe reflect the economics underlying our pension and postretirement obligations while we believe these assumptions are within accepted industry ranges an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a direct impact on reported net earnings 

  

the discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated longterm bonds for fiscal 2014 we used discount rates for our domestic plans of between 430 and 490 and varying rates on our international plans of between 100 and 725 the discount rate for our domestic plans is based on a bond portfolio that includes only longterm bonds with an aa rating or equivalent from a major rating agency we used an abovemean yield curve which represents an estimate of the effective settlement rate of the obligation and the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio are expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of our domestic plans for our international plans the discount rate in a particular country was principally determined based on a yield curve constructed from high quality corporate bonds in each country with the resulting portfolio having a duration matching that particular plan 

  

for fiscal 2014 we used an expected return on plan assets of 750 for our us qualified plan and varying rates of between 225 and 725 for our international plans in determining the longterm rate of return for a plan we consider the historical rates of return the nature of the plan’s investments and an expectation for the plan’s investment strategies see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 12 – pension deferred compensation and postretirement benefit plans ” for details regarding the nature of our pension and postretirement plan investments the difference between actual and expected return on plan assets is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income those gainslosses that are subject to amortization over future periods will be recognized as a component of the net periodic benefit cost in such future periods for fiscal 2014 our pension plans had actual return on assets of approximately 129 million as compared with expected return on assets of approximately 68 million the resulting net deferred gain of approximately 61 million when combined with gains and losses from previous years will be amortized over periods ranging from approximately 7 to 23 years the actual return on plan assets from our global pension plans exceeded expectations primarily reflecting strong performance from global equity and us fixed income investments 

  

a 25 basispoint change in the discount rate or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have had the following effect on fiscal 2014 pension expense 

  

   

our postretirement plans are comprised of health care plans that could be impacted by health care cost trend rates which may have a significant effect on the amounts reported a onepercentagepoint change in assumed health care cost trend rates for fiscal 2014 would have had the following effects 

  

   

to determine the fiscal 2015 net periodic benefit cost we are using discount rates of 430 and 360 for the us qualified plan and the nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan respectively and varying rates for our international plans of between 50 and 675 we are using an expected return on plan assets of 750 for the us qualified plan and varying rates for our international pension plans of between 200 and 675 the net change in these assumptions from those used in fiscal 2014 will result in an increase in pension expense of approximately 3 million in fiscal 2015

goodwill other intangible assets and longlived assets 

goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets other indefinitelived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized 

  

we assess goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles at least annually for impairment as of the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which is one level below our operating segments we identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and management of each reporting unit regularly reviews the operating results of those components we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to determine carrying values for our reporting units impairment testing is performed in two steps i we determine if an indication of impairment exists by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value and ii if there is an impairment we measure the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill the impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets encompasses calculating a fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value if the carrying value exceeds the fair value an impairment charge is recorded 

  

testing goodwill for impairment requires us to estimate fair values of reporting units using significant estimates and assumptions the assumptions made will impact the outcome and ultimate results of the testing we use industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and in certain instances we engage thirdparty valuation specialists for advice to determine fair value of the reporting units we generally use an equal weighting of the income and market approaches in certain circumstances equal weighting will not be applied if one of these methods may be less applicable eg only the income approach would be used for reporting units with existing negative margins we believe both approaches are equally relevant and the most reliable indications of fair value because the fair value of product or service companies is more dependent on the ability to generate earnings than on the value of the assets used in the production process 

  

under the income approach we determine fair value using a discounted cash flow method projecting future cash flows of each reporting unit as well as a terminal value and discounting such cash flows at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows under the market approach we utilize information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units which creates valuation multiples that are applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested to value the reporting unit 

  

the key estimates and factors used in these two approaches include but are not limited to revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts terminal value the weightedaverage cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and comparable market multiples the fiscal 2014 compound annual growth rate of sales for the first eight years of our projections as considered appropriate for the individual reporting units ranged between 3 and 17 with the higher growth rates in certain of the company’s smaller reporting units that are expected to continue the growth that they have exhibited over the past several years the following fiscal 2013 estimates and factors exclude those related to our darphin reporting unit for which we recorded an impairment charge of the remainder of its goodwill the fiscal 2013 compound annual growth rate of sales for the first five to eight years of our projections ranged between 5 and 22 with the higher growth rates in certain of the company’s smaller reporting units that are expected to continue the growth that they have exhibited over the past several years for reporting units with positive earnings growth in the corresponding earnings before interest and taxes ranged from 3 to 38 in fiscal 2014 as compared with 7 to 49 in fiscal 2013 the terminal growth rates were projected at 3 after eight years in fiscal 2014 and five to eight years in fiscal 2013 which reflects our estimate of longterm market and gross domestic product growth the weightedaverage cost of capital used to discount future cash flows ranged from 9 to 17 in fiscal 2014 as compared with 8 to 15 in fiscal 2013 the range of market multiples used in our fiscal 2014 impairment testing was from 12 to 35 times trailingtwelvemonth sales and 90 to 120 times trailingtwelvemonth earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization the range of market multiples used in our fiscal 2013 impairment testing was from 15 to 35 times trailingtwelvemonth sales and between 85 to 130 times trailingtwelvemonth earnings before interest taxes and depreciation and amortization future changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the results of our reviews for impairment of goodwill however a decrease of 100 basis points in our terminal growth rate or an increase of 100 basis points in our weightedaverage cost of capital would still result in a fair value calculation exceeding our book value for each of our reporting units changes in the valuation assumptions from those used in the prior year primarily reflect the impact of the current economic environment on the reporting units and their projected future results of operations 

  

 21  

  

to determine fair value of other indefinitelived intangible assets we use an income approach the relieffromroyalty method this method assumes that in lieu of ownership a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to obtain the rights to use the comparable asset other indefinitelived intangible assets’ fair values require significant judgments in determining both the assets’ estimated cash flows as well as the appropriate discount and royalty rates applied to those cash flows to determine fair value changes in such estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results the fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 terminal growth rate applied to future cash flows was 3 and the fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 discount rates ranged from 9 to 17 in fiscal 2014 and 10 to 18 in fiscal 2013 the fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 royalty rates ranged from 05 to 12 these rates exclude those related to the darphin trademark for which we recorded an impairment charge for its remaining carrying value in fiscal 2013 

  

as of our annual stepone goodwill and indefinitelived asset impairment test on april 1 2014 the fair values of our reporting units and the fair values of our indefinitelived intangible assets substantially exceeded their respective carrying values 

  

we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable when such events or changes in circumstances occur a recoverability test is performed comparing projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset or asset group to its carrying value if the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value an impairment would be recorded for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value which is determined by discounting future cash flows 

  

income taxes 

we account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns as of june 30 2014 we have current net deferred tax assets of 2951 million and noncurrent net deferred tax assets of 855 million the net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization as well as the continued application of currently anticipated tax rates included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance of 1152 million for deferred tax assets where management believes it is morelikelythannot that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the relevant jurisdiction based on our assessments no additional valuation allowance is required if we determine that a deferred tax asset will not be realizable an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will result in a reduction of net earnings at that time while the reduction of a valuation allowance will result in an increase of net earnings at that time 

  

we provide tax reserves for us federal state local and foreign exposures relating to periods subject to audit the development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues potential outcomes and timing and is a subjective critical estimate we assess our tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting dates for those tax positions where it is morelikelythannot that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those tax positions where it is not morelikelythannot that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements we classify applicable interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes although the outcome relating to these exposures is uncertain in management’s opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating from these exposures if actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates they could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations 

  

quantitative analysis 

during the threeyear period ended june 30 2014 there have not been material changes in the assumptions underlying these critical accounting policies nor to the related significant estimates the results of our business underlying these assumptions have not differed significantly from our expectations 

  

while we believe that the estimates that we have made are proper and the related results of operations for the period are presented fairly in all material respects other assumptions could reasonably be justified that would change the amount of reported net sales cost of sales operating expenses or our provision for income taxes as they relate to the provisions for anticipated sales returns allowance for doubtful accounts inventory obsolescence reserve and income taxes for fiscal 2014 had these estimates been changed simultaneously by 25 in either direction our reported gross profit would have increased or decreased by approximately 58 million operating expenses would have changed by approximately 06 million and the provision for income taxes would have increased or decreased by approximately 07 million the collective impact of these changes on operating income net earnings attributable to the estée lauder companies inc and net earnings attributable to the estée lauder companies inc per diluted common share would be an increase or decrease of approximately 64 million 57 million and 01 respectively

results of operations 

we manufacture market and sell beauty products including those in the skin care makeup fragrance and hair care categories which are distributed in over 150 countries and territories the following table is a comparative summary of operating results for fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 and reflects the basis of presentation described in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data — note 2 — summary of significant accounting policies and note 19 — segment data and related information ” for all periods presented products and services that do not meet our definition of skin care makeup fragrance and hair care have been included in the “other” category

the following table presents certain consolidated earnings data as a percentage of net sales 

  

   

in order to meet the demands of consumers we continually introduce new products support new and established products through advertising merchandising and sampling and phase out existing products that no longer meet the needs of our consumers or our objectives the economics of developing producing launching supporting and discontinuing products impact our sales and operating performance each period the introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products which we take into account in our business planning 

  

we operate on a global basis with the majority of our net sales generated outside the united states accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our results of operations therefore we present certain net sales information excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations to provide a framework for assessing the performance of our underlying business outside the united states constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant periodoverperiod we calculate constant currency information by translating current year results using prior year weightedaverage foreign currency exchange rates 

  

overview 

we believe that the best way to continue to increase stockholder value is to provide our customers and consumers with the products and services that they have come to expect from us in the most efficient and profitable manner while recognizing consumers’ changing shopping habits to be the global leader in prestige beauty we continued to implement a longterm strategy that is guiding us through fiscal 2017 the strategy has numerous initiatives across geographic regions channels of distribution product categories brands and functions that are designed to leverage our strengths make us more productive and grow our sales 

  

we have a strong diverse and highly valuable brand portfolio with global reach and potential and we plan to continue building upon and leveraging our history of outstanding creativity innovation and entrepreneurship we have succeeded in expanding our distinctive “hightouch” service model and will continue to look for ways to further evolve it within our channels of distribution and geographic regions as an example we continue to enhance our capabilities to deliver superior retailing experiences across our brands particularly in freestanding retail stores we also continue to increase brand awareness and sales by expanding our multipronged digital presence encompassing ecommerce and mcommerce as well as digital and social media we are leveraging our regional organization in an effort to assure that we are locally relevant with our products services channels marketing and visual merchandising 

  

 24  

  

as part of our strategy we are continuing to position ourselves to capitalize on opportunities in the fastestgrowing areas in prestige beauty skin care our most profitable product category continues to be a strategic priority for our innovation and investment spending particularly in the asiapacific region and with product launches such as advanced night repair synchronized recovery complex ii from estée lauder and dramatically different moisturizing lotion  from clinique we are also focusing our attention on luxury consumers across all product categories and have seen continued strength in the net sales of many of our higherend prestige products we also continue to build our makeup product category through the introduction of new product offerings including new collections from our makeup artist brands and pure color sculpting lipstick from estée lauder and our fragrance category through new launches and innovation such as estée lauder modern muse and new fragrances from michael kors and tory burch in addition we are continuing to expand our hair care brands both in salons and in other retail channels 

  

we are strengthening our geographic presence by seeking share growth in large imagebuilding cities within core markets such as the united states the united kingdom france italy and japan in addition we continue to prioritize efforts to expand our presence and accelerate share growth in emerging markets such as china the middle east eastern europe brazil and south africa and focus on consumers who purchase in the travel retail channel in stores at their travel destinations or when they return to their home market we also continue to expand our digital presence in international markets which has resulted in growth in the net sales of our products sold online in north america despite solid retail sales growth during the holiday season we saw a softening in the retail environment during the second half of fiscal 2014 in our traditional department store channel due in part to adverse winter weather conditions at the same time we continued to expand our presence in other channels such as specialty multibrand retailers freestanding retail stores and online internationally we continue to take actions to grow in european perfumeries and pharmacies and in department stores particularly in asia and the united kingdom in addition we are emphasizing our skin care and makeup initiatives to boost our travel retail sales and continuing efforts to grow our business in the freestanding retail store online specialty multibrand retailer and prestige salon channels the travel retail channel continues to be an important source of sales growth and profitability our business in this channel has benefited from the implementation of programs we designed to target consumers in distinct travel corridors enhance consumers’ “hightouch” experiences and convert travelers into purchasers 

  

while our overall business is performing well we are seeing continued softness in certain southern european countries and korea due to challenging economic environments as well as intensifying competitive pressures globally elsewhere we are cautious of an uncertain retail environment in the united states in the short term unfavorable foreign exchange rates in certain emerging countries and the lower growth rates we have been experiencing in china we also continue to see an adverse impact of chinese government actions on the travel and spending of chinese consumers which are affecting sales in the travel retail channel at their travel destinations and within their home market 

  

we believe we have and will continue to offset to some extent the impact of these challenges as a result of our strategy to mitigate weaknesses we find in certain areas by utilizing the strengths of our diverse brand portfolio and geographic presence in other areas however if economic conditions or the degree of uncertainty or volatility worsen or the adverse conditions previously discussed are further prolonged then we expect there to be a negative effect on ongoing consumer confidence demand and spending and as a result our business we will continue to monitor these and other risks that may affect our business 

  

looking ahead to fiscal 2015 we plan to continue building on our strengths and our heritage of innovation to bring unique and highperformance products with longterm appeal and enduring quality to our consumers we expect our strategy will enable us to continue to succeed in high growth channels benefit from regional opportunities focus on emerging market consumers and enhance our local relevance we plan on continuing to incorporate our personalized “hightouch” philosophy through customization with key retailers expansion in freestanding retail stores and extending it to fastgrowing digital platforms we remain dedicated to investing in select areas to improve our capabilities or develop new ones our main focuses are digital capabilities research and development product innovation consumer insight information technology improvements and operational excellence

we rolled out the last major wave of smi in july 2014 in certain of our remaining locations as a result some retailers accelerated their sales orders that we believe would normally occur in our fiscal 2015 first quarter into our fiscal 2014 fourth quarter in advance of this implementation to provide adequate safety stock to mitigate any potential shortterm business interruption associated with the smi rollout the impact on net sales and operating results by product category and geographic region is as follows 

  

   

these actions created a favorable comparison between fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 of approximately 178 million in net sales and approximately 127 million in operating results and impacted our operating margin comparisons while these additional orders benefited our fiscal 2014 net sales and operating results comparisons we expect there to be a corresponding adverse effect on our first quarter and full year fiscal 2015 net sales and operating results we believe the presentation of certain yeartodate comparative information in the following discussions that excludes the impact of the timing of these orders is useful in analyzing the net sales performance and operating results of our business 

  

impact of recent economic events in venezuela 

  

our venezuelan subsidiary has been operating in a highly inflationary economy since january 2010 ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties in venezuela have resulted in stringent controls on foreign currency exchange in february 2013 there was a devaluation of the venezuelan currency the bolivar fuerte “vef” from an official rate of 43 to 63 we recorded a devaluation charge in our fiscal 2013 third quarter which did not have a significant impact on our consolidated net sales or operating income in october 2013 the venezuelan government introduced an auctionbased foreign currency exchange mechanism “sicad i” participation in the weekly auctions is limited to certain industries determined by the venezuelan government since we were unable to transact in the only sicad i auction we were authorized to participate we continued to use the official published rate of 63 to remeasure our vefdenominated monetary assets and liabilities 

  

during the third quarter of fiscal 2014 the venezuelan government enacted additional changes to the country’s foreign exchange controls that expanded the use of sicad i and created a third exchange control mechanism “sicad ii” which allows all companies in all sectors to apply for the purchase of foreign currency and foreign currency denominated securities for any legal use or purpose as a result we considered our companyspecific facts and circumstances in determining the appropriate remeasurement rate principally assessing our legal eligibility to access the available foreign exchange mechanisms the transactions that would be eligible our past and expected future ability to transact through those mechanisms and our intent to utilize a particular mechanism for particular purposes although the sicad ii mechanism and its level and frequency of exchange continue to be regulated by the venezuelan government it offers the possibility of foreign exchange in a theoretically open market without restricted uses and in our opinion is the only mechanism legally available at this time for our highest priority transactions which are the import of goods we have submitted applications to access us dollars through the sicad ii mechanism and certain applications have been approved and we have received funds through june 30 2014 while there is no guarantee our future applications will be accepted based on the enacted changes and related considerations of how our business is eligible under the requirements established by the venezuelan authorities we believe the sicad ii rate was and continues to be the most appropriate rate that reflects the economics of our venezuelan subsidiary’s business since march 24 2014 when the sicad ii mechanism became operational as a result we changed the exchange rate used to remeasure our vefdenominated monetary assets and liabilities from 63 to the sicad ii rate which was 4998 as of june 30 2014 accordingly a remeasurement charge of 383 million on a before and after tax basis was reflected in our consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended june 30 2014 

  

 26  

  

furthermore in january 2014 in an effort to control inflation pricing and product shortages the venezuelan government enacted a law which imposed a cap on profit margins we have evaluated the impact of this law and while it has challenged our local business it did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended june 30 2014 

  

further controls on foreign currency exchange or other actions by the venezuelan government could have an impact on our local business however we do not consider our venezuelan operations significant to our overall business on a consolidated basis we derived less than 1 of our net sales and approximately 1 of our operating income before the remeasurement charge from our business in venezuela for the year ended june 30 2014 

  

returns and charges associated with restructuring activities 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2013 we closed our multifaceted cost savings program implemented in february 2009 the “program” and have executed substantially all remaining initiatives as of june 30 2014 total cumulative restructuring charges and other costs to implement those initiatives from inception of the program to date are 3175 million 

  

restructuring charges adjustments 

  

the following table presents aggregate restructuring charges adjustments related to the program to date 

  

   

the following table presents accrued restructuring charges adjustments and the related activities under the program to date 

  

   

accrued restructuring charges at june 30 2014 are expected to result in cash expenditures funded from cash provided by operations of approximately 7 million and 1 million in fiscal 2015 and 2016 respectively

net sales 

  

net sales increased 8 or 7871 million to 109688 million primarily reflecting growth in all of our product categories and geographic regions the impact of foreign currency translation on the change in net sales was de minimis 

  

in advance of our july 2014 implementation of smi at certain of our locations and to provide adequate safety stock to mitigate any potential shortterm business interruption associated with the rollout certain of our retailers accelerated their orders during the fiscal 2014 fourth quarter we believe those additional orders which totaled approximately 178 million would normally occur in our fiscal 2015 first quarter and created a favorable comparison to fiscal 2013 while these additional orders benefited our fiscal 2014 net sales comparison we expect there to be a corresponding adverse effect on our first quarter and full year fiscal 2015 net sales adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders reported net sales would have increased 6 with growth in all of our product categories and geographic regions 

  

product categories 

the change in net sales in each product category benefited from the accelerated orders during the current year as discussed above as follows skin care approximately 91 million makeup approximately 65 million fragrance approximately 21 million and hair care approximately 1 million 

  

skin care 

net sales of skin care products increased 7 or 3045 million to 47698 million the recent launches of advanced night repair synchronized recovery complex ii and micro essence skin activating treatment lotion from estée lauder and dramatically different moisturizing lotion  and reformulated repairwear laser focus from clinique contributed approximately 615 million of incremental sales combined also contributing to the increase were higher sales of la mer products and the nutritious line of products from estée lauder of approximately 144 million combined partially offsetting these increases were lower sales of certain existing advanced night repair synchronized recovery products from estée lauder and dramatically different moisturizing lotion and repairwear laser focus from clinique of approximately 493 million combined excluding the impact of foreign currency translation skin care net sales increased 8 adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders reported net sales in skin care would have increased 5 

  

makeup 

makeup net sales increased 9 or 3333 million to 42102 million primarily reflecting higher net sales from our makeup artist brands the recent launch of all about shadow from clinique and higher sales of smashbox products of approximately 339 million combined sales from our makeup artist brands benefited from new product offerings as well as expanded distribution in line with our retail store strategy partially offsetting these increases were lower sales of chubby stick moisturizing lip colour balm and high impact lip color from clinique as well as the prioryear launches of pore refining solutions makeup from clinique and pure color vivid shine lipstick from estée lauder of approximately 34 million combined the impact of foreign currency translation on makeup net sales was de minimis adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders reported net sales in makeup would have increased 7 

  

fragrance 

net sales of fragrance products increased 9 or 1142 million to 14250 million primarily reflecting the recent launches of estée lauder modern muse the michael kors collection jo malone peony  blush suede and tory burch as well as higher sales of tom ford black orchid of approximately 149 million combined these increases were partially offset by lower sales of estée lauder pleasures  donna karan cashmere mist dkny be delicious so intense and coach poppy of approximately 31 million combined the impact of foreign currency translation on fragrance net sales was de minimis adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders reported net sales in fragrance would have increased 7 

  

 28  

  

hair care 

hair care net sales increased 5 or 267 million to 5156 million reflecting the continued success and growth of the invati line of products and the new and reformulated dry remedy line of products from aveda which contributed approximately 25 million combined to the increase the category benefited from sales generated from expanded global distribution of aveda products to salons and in the travel retail channel and bumble and bumble products to specialty multibrand retailers partially offsetting these increases were lower sales of ojon products the decrease in ojon net sales was primarily due to the exit of that business from the direct response television channel in our fiscal 2014 second quarter excluding the impact of foreign currency translation hair care net sales increased 6 the impact of the accelerated orders on the change in reported net sales in hair care was de minimis 

  

geographic regions

cost of sales 

  

cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales decreased to 197 as compared with 199 in the prior year cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales reflected strategic changes in pricing and the mix of our business of approximately 30 basis points and favorable manufacturing variances of approximately 10 basis points partially offsetting these changes were an increase in obsolescence charges and the unfavorable effect of exchange rates of approximately 10 basis points each 

  

since certain promotional activities are a component of sales or cost of sales and the timing and level of promotions vary with our promotional calendar we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in the cost of sales percentage in addition future cost of sales mix may be impacted by the inclusion of potential new brands or channels of distribution which have margin and product cost structures different from those of our current mix of business

operating expenses 

  

operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 636 as compared with 651 in the prior year as a percentage of net sales this decrease primarily reflected lower spending on advertising merchandising and sampling of approximately 110 basis points lower selling costs of approximately 50 basis points and a favorable comparison to the prior year which reflected restructuring goodwill and other impairment charges of approximately 40 basis points combined these improvements were partially offset by a charge in the current year to remeasure net monetary assets in venezuela of approximately 30 basis points and unfavorable changes in foreign exchange transactions of approximately 10 basis points adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders in the current year operating expenses as a percentage of net sales would have decreased 50 basis points primarily reflecting lower spending on advertising merchandising and sampling and lower selling costs 

  

changes in advertising merchandising and sampling spending result from the type timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts as well as the markets and brands being emphasized 

  

operating results 

  

operating income increased 20 or 3016 million to 18276 million and operating margin increased to 167 of net sales as compared with 150 in the prior year which primarily reflected our lower operating expense margin and to a lesser extent our higher gross margin the overall operating results were also impacted by approximately 127 million related to the accelerated orders in the current year as discussed above which created a favorable comparison to the prior year partially offset by the current year remeasurement of net monetary assets in venezuela of 383 million while these additional orders benefited our fiscal 2014 operating results comparison we expect there to be a corresponding adverse effect on our first quarter and full year fiscal 2015 operating results the following discussions of operating results by product categories and geographic regions exclude the impact of total charges adjustments associated with restructuring activities of 29 million or less than 1 of net sales for fiscal 2014 and 178 million or less than 1 of net sales for fiscal 2013 we believe the following analysis of operating results better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders in the current year and charges adjustments associated with restructuring activities operating income would have increased 10 and operating margin would have increased 50 basis points

provision for income taxes 

  

the provision for income taxes represents us federal foreign state and local income taxes the effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state and local income taxes the taxation of foreign income and income tax reserve adjustments which represent changes in our net liability for unrecognized tax benefits including tax settlements and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations our effective tax rate will change from year to year based on recurring and nonrecurring factors including but not limited to the geographical mix of earnings enacted tax legislation state and local income taxes tax reserve adjustments the ultimate disposition of deferred tax assets relating to stockbased compensation and the interaction of various global tax strategies in addition changes in judgment from the evaluation of new information resulting in the recognition derecognition or remeasurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period are recognized separately in the period of change 

  

the effective rate for income taxes was 320 and 306 for fiscal 2014 and 2013 respectively the increase in the rate of 140 basis points was principally attributable to a higher effective tax rate related to the company’s foreign operations which included the impact of the venezuela remeasurement charge for which no tax benefit has been provided as well as slightly higher favorable income tax reserve adjustments recorded in the prior year 

  

net earnings attributable to the estÉe lauder companies inc

financial condition 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

overview 

  

our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program borrowings from the issuance of longterm debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks and other lenders in the united states and abroad at june 30 2014 we had cash and cash equivalents of 16291 million compared with 14957 million at june 30 2013 our cash and cash equivalents are maintained at a number of financial institutions to mitigate the risk of uninsured balances we select financial institutions based on their credit ratings and financial strength and perform ongoing evaluations of these institutions to limit our concentration risk exposure 

  

our business is seasonal in nature and accordingly our working capital needs vary from time to time we may enter into investing and financing transactions that require additional funding to the extent that these needs exceed cash from operations we could subject to market conditions issue commercial paper issue longterm debt securities or borrow under our revolving credit facilities 

  

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that cash on hand cash generated from operations available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business operations information systems enhancements capital expenditures potential stock repurchases potential acquisitions and investments commitments and other contractual obligations on both a nearterm and longterm basis our cash and cash equivalents balance at june 30 2014 includes approximately 1140 million of cash in offshore jurisdictions associated with our permanent reinvestment strategy we do not believe that the indefinite reinvestment of these funds offshore impairs our ability to meet our domestic debt or working capital obligations if these indefinitely reinvested earnings were repatriated into the united states as dividends we would be subject to additional taxes 

  

the effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years generally we have been able to introduce new products at higher prices increase prices and implement other operating efficiencies to sufficiently offset cost increases which have been moderate 

  

credit ratings 

changes in our credit ratings will likely result in changes in our borrowing costs our credit ratings also impact the cost of our revolving credit facility as discussed below downgrades in our credit ratings may reduce our ability to issue commercial paper andor longterm debt and would likely increase the relative costs of borrowing a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating as of august 14 2014 our commercial paper is rated a1 by standard  poor’s and p1 by moody’s and our longterm debt is rated a with a stable outlook by standard  poor’s and a2 with a stable outlook by moody’s 

  

debt 

at june 30 2014 our outstanding borrowings were as follows

we have a fixed rate promissory note agreement with a financial institution pursuant to which we may borrow up to 1500 million in the form of loan participation notes through one of our subsidiaries in europe the interest rate on borrowings under this agreement is at an allin fixed rate determined by the lender and agreed to by us at the date of each borrowing at june 30 2014 no borrowings were outstanding under this agreement debt issuance costs incurred related to this agreement were de minimis

net cash used for financing activities was 8569 million 6115 million and 5851 million in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the increase in cash used for financing activities as compared with fiscal 2013 primarily reflected an increase in treasury stock purchases which were partially offset by lower dividend payments that resulted from the transition to quarterly dividends in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 and the final annual dividend payment made that year in addition the prior year reflected the proceeds from the issuance of the 2022 senior notes and 2042 senior notes which was partially offset by the redemption of the 2013 senior notes and repayment of commercial paper the increase in cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2013 as compared with fiscal 2012 primarily reflected the repayment of outstanding commercial paper during fiscal 2013 higher dividends paid as a result of the increase in the annual dividend rate and transition to a quarterly dividend payout schedule and higher redemptions of longterm debt during fiscal 2013 partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of the 2022 senior notes and 2042 senior notes in august 2012 and lower treasury stock repurchases

dividends 

  

the following is a summary of cash dividends declared per share on our class a and class b common stock during the year ended june 30 2014

pension and postretirement plan funding 

  

several factors influence the annual funding requirements for our pension plans for the us qualified plan our funding policy consists of annual contributions at a rate that provides for future plan benefits and maintains appropriate funded percentages such contribution is not less than the minimum required by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended “erisa” and subsequent pension legislation and is not more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes for each international plan our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations in addition amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions as detailed in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies and estimates ” the effect of our pension plan funding on future operating results will depend on economic conditions employee demographics mortality rates the number of participants electing to take lumpsum distributions investment performance and funding decisions 

  

for the us qualified plan we maintain an investment strategy of matching the duration of a substantial portion of the plan assets with the duration of the underlying plan liabilities this strategy assists us in maintaining our overall funded ratio for fiscal 2014 and 2013 we met or exceeded all contribution requirements under erisa regulations for the us qualified plan as we continue to monitor the performance of our plan assets we may decide to make discretionary cash contributions to the us qualified plan or our postretirement plan in the united states during fiscal 2015 but do not have plans to do so at this time 

  

for fiscal 2014 and 2013 we made benefit payments under our nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan of 72 million and 61 million respectively we expect to make benefit payments under this plan during fiscal 2015 of approximately 144 million for fiscal 2014 and 2013 we made cash contributions to our international defined benefit pension plans of 279 million and 259 million respectively we expect to make contributions under these plans during fiscal 2015 of approximately 240 million 

  

commitments and contingencies 

  

certain of our business acquisition agreements include “earnout” provisions these provisions generally require that we pay to the seller or sellers of the business additional amounts based on the performance of the acquired business since the size of each payment depends upon performance of the acquired business we do not expect that such payments will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or financial condition 

  

for additional contingencies refer to “item 3 legal proceedings” 

  

 38  

  

contractual obligations 

  

the following table summarizes scheduled maturities of our contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed and determinable as of june 30 2014 

  

   

1   includes longterm and current debt and the related projected interest costs and to a lesser extent capital lease commitments interest costs on longterm and current debt are projected to be 613 million in each of the years from fiscal 2015 through fiscal 2017 446 million in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 and 7287 million thereafter projected interest costs on variable rate instruments were calculated using market rates at june 30 2014 refer to “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 9 – debt ” 

  

2   minimum operating lease commitments only include base rent certain leases provide for contingent rents that are not measurable at inception and primarily include rents based on a percentage of sales in excess of stipulated levels as well as common area maintenance these amounts are excluded from minimum operating lease commitments and are included in the determination of total rent expense when it is probable that the expense has been incurred and the amount is reasonably measurable 

  

3   unconditional purchase obligations primarily include inventory commitments estimated future earnout payments estimated royalty payments pursuant to license agreements advertising commitments capital improvement commitments planned funding of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations commitments pursuant to executive compensation arrangements obligations related to our cost savings initiatives and acquisitions future earnout payments and future royalty and advertising commitments were estimated based on planned future sales for the term that was in effect at june 30 2014 without consideration for potential renewal periods 

  

4   refer to “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 7 – income taxes” for information regarding unrecognized tax benefits as of june 30 2014 the noncurrent portion of our unrecognized tax benefits including related accrued interest and penalties was 695 million at this time the settlement period for the noncurrent portion of the unrecognized tax benefits including related accrued interest and penalties cannot be determined and therefore was not included 

  

derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 

  

we address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and may enter into option contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates and interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on our aggregate liability portfolio we also enter into foreign currency forward contracts and may use option contracts not designated as hedging instruments to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes costs associated with entering into these derivative financial instruments have not been material to our consolidated financial results 

  

for each derivative contract entered into where we look to obtain hedge accounting treatment we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items as well as our riskmanagement objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction the nature of the risk being hedged how the hedging instruments’ effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively and a description of the method of measuring ineffectiveness this process includes linking all derivatives to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions we also formally assess both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items if it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge we will be required to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively 

  

 39  

  

foreign exchange risk management 

  

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge anticipated transactions as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies for periods consistent with our identified exposures the purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on costs and on the cash flows that we receive from foreign subsidiaries the majority of foreign currency forward contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries we may also enter into foreign currency option contracts to hedge anticipated transactions where there is a high probability that anticipated exposures will materialize the foreign currency forward contracts entered into to hedge anticipated transactions have been designated as foreign currency cashflow hedges and have varying maturities through the end of june 2016 hedge effectiveness of foreign currency forward contracts is based on a hypothetical derivative methodology and excludes the portion of fair value attributable to the spotforward difference which is recorded in currentperiod earnings hedge effectiveness of foreign currency option contracts is based on a dollar offset methodology the ineffective portion of both foreign currency forward and option contracts is recorded in currentperiod earnings for hedge contracts that are no longer deemed highly effective hedge accounting is discontinued and gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income loss are reclassified to earnings when the underlying forecasted transaction occurs if it is probable that the forecasted transaction will no longer occur then any gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income loss are reclassified to currentperiod earnings as of june 30 2014 these foreign currency cashflow hedges were highly effective in all material respects 

  

at june 30 2014 we had foreign currency forward contracts in the amount of 15973 million the foreign currencies included in foreign currency forward contracts notional value stated in us dollars are principally the british pound 2672 million euro 2398 million swiss franc 1704 million canadian dollar 1386 million australian dollar 1113 million japanese yen 1080 million and hong kong dollar 1030 million 

  

credit risk 

  

as a matter of policy we only enter into derivative contracts with counterparties that have a longterm credit rating of at least a or higher by at least two nationally recognized rating agencies the counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions exposure to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to the gross fair value of contracts in asset positions which totaled 42 million at june 30 2014 to manage this risk we have established strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored accordingly management believes risk of loss under these hedging contracts is remote 

  

certain of our derivative financial instruments with two counterparties contain creditriskrelated contingent features at june 30 2014 we were in a net liability position for certain derivative contracts that contain such features such creditriskrelated contingent features would be triggered if a upon a merger involving the company the ratings of the surviving entity were materially weaker than prior to the merger or b the company’s credit ratings fall below investment grade rated below bbbbaa3 and the company fails to enter into an international swaps  derivatives association credit support annex within 30 days of being requested by the counterparty the fair value of collateral required to settle the instruments immediately if a triggering event were to occur is estimated at approximately the fair value of the contracts the fair value of those contracts as of june 30 2014 was 45 million as of june 30 2014 we were in compliance with such creditriskrelated contingent features 

  

market risk 

  

we use a valueatrisk model to assess the market risk of our derivative financial instruments valueatrisk represents the potential losses for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors for a specified time period and confidence level we estimate valueatrisk across all of our derivative financial instruments using a model with historical volatilities and correlations calculated over the past 250day period the high low and average measured valueatrisk during fiscal 2014 related to our foreign exchange contracts is as follows 

  

   

the model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 percent confidence level we used a statistical simulation model that valued our derivative financial instruments against one thousand randomly generated market price paths 

our calculated valueatrisk exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may or may not occur it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated based upon actual fluctuations in market rates operating exposures and the timing thereof and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year we believe however that any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the derivative financial instrument was intended 

  

 40  

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

we do not maintain any offbalance sheet arrangements transactions obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities other than operating leases that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations

we are continually benchmarking the performance of the supply chain and will change suppliers and adjust our distribution networks and manufacturing footprint based upon the changing needs of the business as we integrate acquired brands we continually seek new ways to leverage our production and sourcing capabilities to improve our overall supply chain performance

 item 1a risk factors 

  

there are risks associated with an investment in our securities 

  

please consider the following risks and all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k and in our subsequent filings with the securities and exchange commission “sec” our business may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial if any of the events contemplated by the following discussion of risks should occur or other risks arise or develop our business prospects financial condition and results of operations as well as the trading prices of our securities may be adversely affected 

  

the beauty business is highly competitive and if we are unable to compete effectively our results will suffer 

  

we face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world including multinational consumer product companies some of these competitors have greater resources than we do and may be able to respond to changing business and economic conditions more quickly than us competition in the beauty business is based on pricing of products innovation perceived value service to the consumer promotional activities advertising special events new product introductions ecommerce and mcommerce initiatives and other activities it is difficult for us to predict the timing and scale of our competitors’ actions in these areas also the consolidation in the retail trade has resulted in us becoming increasingly dependent on key retailers including largeformat retailers who have increased their negotiating strength this could result in an increased risk related to the concentration of our customers a severe adverse impact on the business operations of our customers could have a corresponding material adverse effect on us our ability to compete also depends on the continued strength of our brands our ability to attract and retain key talent and other personnel the efficiency of our manufacturing facilities and distribution network and our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property and those other rights used in our business in addition certain of our key retailers around the world market and sell competing brands or are owned or otherwise affiliated with companies that market and sell competing brands our inability to continue to compete effectively in key countries around the world could have an adverse impact on our business 

  

our inability to anticipate and respond to market trends and changes in consumer preferences could adversely affect our financial results 

  

our continued success depends on our ability to anticipate gauge and react in a timely and costeffective manner to changes in consumer tastes for skin care makeup fragrance and hair care products attitudes toward our industry and brands as well as to where and how consumers shop for those products we must continually work to develop manufacture and market new products maintain and adapt our “hightouch” services to existing and emerging distribution channels maintain and enhance the recognition of our brands achieve a favorable mix of products and refine our approach as to how and where we market and sell our products while we devote considerable effort and resources to shape analyze and respond to consumer preferences we recognize that consumer tastes cannot be predicted with certainty and can change rapidly the issue is compounded by the increasing use of social and digital media by consumers and the speed by which information and opinions are shared if we are unable to anticipate and respond to sudden challenges that we may face in the marketplace trends in the market for our products and changing consumer demands and sentiment our financial results will suffer 

  

our future success depends on our ability to achieve our longterm strategy 

  

achieving our longterm strategy will require investment in new capabilities brands categories distribution channels technologies and emerging and more mature geographic markets these investments may result in shortterm costs without any current revenues and therefore may be dilutive to our earnings at least in the short term in addition we may dispose of or discontinue select brands or streamline operations and incur costs or restructuring and other charges in doing so although we believe that our strategy will lead to longterm growth in revenue and profitability we may not realize in full or in part the anticipated benefits the failure to realize benefits which may be due to our inability to execute plans global or local economic conditions competition changes in the beauty industry and the other risks described herein could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

 11  

  

acquisitions may expose us to additional risks 

  

we continuously review acquisition opportunities that would expand our current product offerings our distribution channels increase the size and geographic scope of our operations or otherwise offer growth and operating efficiency opportunities if required the financing for any of these acquisitions could result in an increase in our indebtedness dilute the interests of our stockholders or both acquisitions entail numerous risks which may include 

  

·   difficulties in assimilating acquired operations or products including the loss of key employees from or customers of acquired businesses 

·   diversion of management’s attention from our core businesses 

·   adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and 

·   risks of entering distribution channels categories or markets in which we have limited or no prior experience 

  

our failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate acquisitions on favorable terms 

  

completed acquisitions typically result in additional goodwill andor an increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet we are required at least annually or as facts and circumstances exist to test goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to determine if impairment has occurred if the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the fair value of other intangible assets with indefinite lives in the period the determination is made we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

a general economic downturn or sudden disruption in business conditions may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items andor the financial strength of our customers that are retailers which could adversely affect our financial results 

  

the general level of consumer spending is affected by a number of factors including general economic conditions inflation interest rates energy costs and consumer confidence generally all of which are beyond our control consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower and may impact sales of our products a decline in consumer purchases of discretionary items also tends to impact our customers that are retailers we generally extend credit to a retailer based on an evaluation of its financial condition usually without requiring collateral however the financial difficulties of a retailer could cause us to curtail or eliminate business with that customer we may also assume more credit risk relating to the receivables from that retailer our inability to collect the receivable from one of our largest customers or from a group of customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition if a retailer was to liquidate we may incur additional costs if we choose to purchase the retailer’s inventory of our products to protect brand equity 

  

in addition sudden disruptions in business conditions for example as a consequence of events such as a pandemic or local or international conflicts around the world or as a result of a terrorist attack retaliation and the threat of further attacks or retaliation or as a result of adverse weather conditions or climate changes or seismic events can have a shortterm and sometimes longterm impact on consumer spending 

  

events that impact consumers’ willingness or ability to travel andor purchase our products while traveling may impact our business including travel retail a significant contributor to our overall results and our strategy to market and sell products to international travelers at their destinations 

  

a downturn in the economies of or continuing recessions in the countries where we sell our products or a sudden disruption of business conditions in those countries could adversely affect consumer confidence the financial strength of our retailers and our sales and profitability we continue to see weakness due to global economic uncertainties and volatility in financial markets particularly in certain southern european countries and korea elsewhere we are cautious of a slowing retail environment in the united states in the short term and that a slowing of the future growth trend of the chinese economy may temper our retail sales growth including that of our travel retail business 

  

volatility in the financial markets and a related economic downturn in key markets or markets generally throughout the world could have a material adverse effect on our business while we currently generate significant cash flows from our ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities credit markets may experience significant disruptions deterioration in global financial markets could make future financing difficult or more expensive if any financial institutions that are parties to our undrawn revolving credit facility supporting our commercial paper program or other financing arrangements such as interest rate or foreign exchange hedging instruments were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us this could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain interest rate or foreign currency exposures which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

 12  

  

changes in laws regulations and policies that affect our business could adversely affect our financial results 

  

our business is subject to numerous laws regulations and policies changes in the laws regulations and policies including the interpretation or enforcement thereof that affect or will affect our business including changes in accounting standards tax laws and regulations laws and regulations relating to data privacy anticorruption advertising manufacturing distribution product registration ingredients chemicals and packaging laws in europe and elsewhere relating to selective distribution environmental or climate change laws regulations or accords trade rules and customs regulations and the outcome and expense of legal or regulatory proceedings and any action we may take as a result could adversely affect our financial results 

  

we are involved and may become involved in the future in disputes and other legal or regulatory proceedings that if adversely decided or settled could adversely affect our financial results 

  

we are and may in the future become party to litigation other disputes or regulatory proceedings in general claims made by us or against us in litigation disputes or other proceedings can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements injunctions or damages that could significantly affect our business or financial results we are currently vigorously contesting certain of these claims however it is not possible to predict the final resolution of the litigation disputes or proceedings to which we currently are or may in the future become party to and the impact of certain of these matters on our business results of operations and financial condition could be material 

  

government reviews inquiries investigations and actions could harm our business or reputation 

  

as we operate in various locations around the world our operations in certain countries are subject to significant governmental scrutiny and may be adversely impacted by the results of such scrutiny the regulatory environment with regard to our business is evolving and officials often exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply applicable regulations from time to time we may receive formal and informal inquiries from various government regulatory authorities as well as selfregulatory organizations about our business and compliance with local laws regulations or standards any determination that our operations or activities or the activities of our employees are not in compliance with existing laws regulations or standards could result in the imposition of substantial fines interruptions of business loss of supplier vendor or other thirdparty relationships termination of necessary licenses and permits or similar results all of which could potentially harm our business andor reputation even if an inquiry does not result in these types of determinations it potentially could create negative publicity which could harm our business andor reputation 

  

our success depends in part on the quality and safety of our products 

  

our success depends in part on the quality and safety of our products if our products are found to be defective or unsafe or if they otherwise fail to meet our consumers’ standards our relationships with customers or consumers could suffer the appeal of one or more of our brands could be diminished and we could lose sales andor become subject to liability claims any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

our success depends in part on our key personnel 

  

our success depends in part on our ability to retain our key personnel including our executive officers and senior management team the unexpected loss of one or more of our key employees could adversely affect our business our success also depends in part on our continuing ability to identify hire train and retain other highly qualified personnel competition for these employees can be intense we may not be able to attract assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business this risk may be exacerbated by the stresses associated with the implementation of our strategic plan and other initiatives 

  

 13  

  

we are subject to risks related to our foreign operations 

  

we operate on a global basis with a majority of our fiscal 2013 net sales and operating income generated outside the united states 

  

we intend to reinvest these earnings in our foreign operations indefinitely except where we are able to repatriate these earnings to the united states without material incremental tax provision a portion of our cash and cash equivalents that result from these earnings remain outside the united states if these indefinitely reinvested earnings were repatriated into the united states as dividends we would be subject to additional taxes 

  

we maintain offices in over 50 countries and have key operational facilities located outside the united states that manufacture warehouse or distribute goods for sale throughout the world foreign operations are subject to many risks and uncertainties including 

  

·   fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which can affect our results of operations the value of our foreign assets the relative prices at which we and foreign competitors sell products in the same markets and the cost of certain inventory and noninventory items required in our operations 

  

·   foreign laws regulations and policies including restrictions on trade import and export license requirements and tariffs and taxes as well as united states laws and regulations relating to foreign trade operations and investment 

  

·   lack of wellestablished or reliable legal and administrative systems in certain countries in which we operate and 

  

·   adverse weather conditions currency exchange controls and social economic and geopolitical conditions such as terrorist attacks war or other military action 

  

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects reputation results of operations and financial condition 

  

a disruption in operations or our supply chain could adversely affect our business and financial results 

  

as a company engaged in manufacturing and distribution on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including industrial accidents environmental events strikes and other labor disputes disruptions in supply chain or information systems loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites or suppliers product quality control safety increase in commodity prices and energy costs licensing requirements and other regulatory issues as well as natural disasters and other external factors over which we have no control if such an event were to occur it could have an adverse affect on our business and financial results 

  

we use a wide variety of direct and indirect suppliers of goods and services from around the world some of our products rely on single or a limited number of suppliers changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers could subject us to losses or adversely affect our ability to bring products to market further the failure of our suppliers to deliver goods and services in sufficient quantities in compliance with applicable standards and in a timely manner could adversely affect our customer service levels and overall business in addition any increases in the costs of goods and services for our business may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies in our operations 

  

our information systems and websites may be susceptible to cybersecurity breaches outages and other risks 

  

we have information systems that support our business processes including product development marketing sales order processing production distribution finance and intracompany communications throughout the world we have ecommerce mcommerce and other internet websites in the united states and many other countries these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire floods power loss telecommunications failures breakins and similar events despite the implementation of network security measures our systems may be vulnerable to cybersecurity breaches such as computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering the occurrence of these or other events could disrupt or damage our information systems and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

 14  

  

failure to adequately maintain the security of our electronic and other confidential information could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

  

we are dependent upon automated information technology processes as part of our normal business activities we collect and store certain information that is confidential proprietary or otherwise sensitive including personal information with respect to customers and employees we may share some of this information with vendors who assist us with certain aspects of our business moreover the success of our ecommerce and mcommerce operations depends upon the secure transmission of confidential and personal data over public networks including the use of cashless payments any failure on the part of us or our vendors to maintain the security of our confidential data and our employees’ and customers’ personal information including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information could result in business disruption damage to our reputation financial obligations to third parties fines penalties regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs and also result in deterioration in our employees’ and customers’ confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages and thus could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to enhance our information security systems and could result in a disruption to our operations 

  

we are subject to risks associated with implementing global information systems 

  

as part of our strategic modern initiative “smi” we are implementing enterprisewide global programs intended to deliver a single set of integrated data processes and technologies which would be scalable and used to standardize business processes across brands regions and functions we anticipate the continued migration of our operations to sap with the majority of our locations to be enabled through calendar 2014 we are also implementing other systems including global human resource management systems and retail operating systems like most entitywide changes to software systems the implementation of smi and other systems involve risks and uncertainties failure to implement smi and other systems as planned in terms of timing specifications andor costs could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

  

as we outsource more functions we will become more dependent on the entities performing those functions 

  

as part of our longterm strategy we are continually looking for opportunities to provide essential business services in a more costeffective manner in some cases this requires the outsourcing of functions or parts of functions that can be performed more effectively by external service providers these include certain information systems functions such as information technology operations and certain human resource functions such as employee benefit plan administration while we believe we conduct appropriate due diligence before entering into agreements with the outsourcing entity the failure of one or more entities to provide the expected services provide them on a timely basis or to provide them at the prices we expect may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

  

the trading prices of our securities periodically may rise or fall based on the accuracy of predictions of our earnings or other financial performance 

  

our business planning process is designed to maximize our longterm strength growth and profitability not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter we believe that this longerterm focus is in the best interests of the company and our stockholders at the same time however we recognize that it may be helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our forecast of net sales earnings per share and other financial metrics or projections accordingly when we announced our yearend financial results for fiscal 2013 we provided guidance as to a number of assumptions including our expected net sales and earnings per share for the fiscal year ending june 30 2014 and the quarter ending september 30 2013 while we generally expect to provide updates to our guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter we assume no responsibility to update any of our forwardlooking statements at such times or otherwise in addition the longerterm guidance we provide is based on goals that we believe at the time guidance is given are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years such targets are more difficult to predict than our current quarter and fiscal year expectations 

  

in all of our public statements when we make or update a forwardlooking statement about our net sales andor earnings expectations or expectations regarding restructuring or other initiatives we accompany such statements directly or by reference to a public document with a list of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we expect such a list is included among other places in our earnings press release and in our periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission eg in our reports on form 10k and form 10q these and other factors may make it difficult for us and for outside observers such as research analysts to predict what our earnings will be in any given fiscal quarter or year 

  

 15  

  

outside analysts and investors have the right to make their own predictions of our financial results for any future period outside analysts however have access to no more material information about our results or plans than any other public investor and we do not endorse their predictions as to our future performance nor do we assume any responsibility to correct the predictions of outside analysts or others when they differ from our own internal expectations if and when we announce actual results that differ from those that outside analysts or others have been predicting the market price of our securities could be affected investors who rely on the predictions of outside analysts or others when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk we take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in the prices of our securities 

  

we are controlled by the lauder family as a result of their control of us the lauder family has the ability to prevent or cause a change in control or approve prevent or influence certain actions by us 

  

as of august 19 2013 members of the lauder family beneficially own directly or indirectly shares of the company’s class a common stock with one vote per share and class b common stock with 10 votes per share having 86 of the outstanding voting power of the common stock in addition there are four members of the lauder family who are employees including three who are members of our board of directors another family member is on our board and is a party to a consulting agreement and a license agreement with us as a result of the stock ownership and their positions at the company the lauder family has the ability to exercise significant control and influence over our business including without limitation all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors amendments to the certificate of incorporation and significant corporate transactions such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets for the foreseeable future 

  

we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the new york stock exchange rules and as a result are relying on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that are designed to provide protection to stockholders of companies that are not “controlled companies” 

  

the lauder family and their related entities own more than 50 of the total voting power of our common shares and as a result we are a “controlled company” under the new york stock exchange corporate governance standards as a controlled company we are exempt under the new york stock exchange standards from the obligation to comply with certain new york stock exchange corporate governance requirements including the requirements 

  

·   that a majority of our board of directors consists of independent directors 

·   that we have a nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities and 

·   that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities 

  

while we have voluntarily caused our board to have a majority of independent directors and the written charters of our nominating and board affairs committee and the compensation committee to have the required provisions we are not requiring our nominating and board affairs committee and compensation committee to be comprised solely of independent directors as a result of our use of the “controlled company” exemptions investors will not have the same protection afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the new york stock exchange corporate governance requirements

 item 3 legal proceedings  

  

we are involved from time to time in litigation and other legal proceedings incidental to our business management believes that the outcome of current litigation and legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial condition however management’s assessment of our current litigation and other legal proceedings could change in light of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions or other proceedings pending against us not presently known to us or determinations by judges juries or other finders of fact which are not in accord with management’s evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such litigation or proceedings except as disclosed below reasonably possible losses in addition to the amounts accrued for litigation and other legal proceedings are not material to our consolidated financial statements

during the fiscal 2007 fourth quarter the former owner of the darphin brand initiated litigation in the paris commercial court against us seeking to recover €600 million 783 million at the exchange rate at june 30 2013 that he claims he was owed as additional consideration for the sale of darphin to us in april 2003 on december 23 2011 the paris commercial court issued its judgment awarding the former owner €229 million 299 million at the exchange rate at june 30 2013 plus interest from 2007 we have filed our appeal with the paris court of appeal and oral arguments for the appeal are scheduled for december 2013 in accordance with the judgment in january 2012 we paid €253 million 330 million at the exchange rate at june 30 2013 to the former owner and received from him a bank guarantee to assure repayment to us of such sum or any part thereof in the event that the judgment is reversed by the paris court of appeal based upon our assessment of the case as well as the advice of external counsel we are maintaining the amount we previously accrued as an amount that we believe will ultimately be paid based on the probable outcome of the appeal such amount is less than the paris commercial court’s award

market for registrant’s common equity and related stockholder matters 

  

our class a common stock is publicly traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol “el” the following table shows the high and low per share sales prices as reported on the new york stock exchange composite tape and the cash dividends per share declared in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 

  

   

  

we expect to continue the payment of cash dividends in the future but there can be no assurance that the board of directors will continue to declare them we transitioned to a quarterly dividend payout schedule for our class a and class b common stock beginning in the fiscal 2013 third quarter accordingly the total cash dividends per share in fiscal 2013 is equivalent to six quarterly dividends as a result the total value of cash dividends per share expected to be paid in fiscal 2014 will be lower than the dividends per share paid in fiscal 2013 

  

on august 14 2013 a dividend was declared in the amount of 18 per share on our class a and class b common stock the dividend is payable in cash on september 16 2013 to stockholders of record at the close of business on august 30 2013 

  

as of august 19 2013 there were 8464 record holders of class a common stock and 17 record holders of class b common stock

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition at june 30 2013 and our results of operations for the three fiscal years ended june 30 2013 are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements these estimates and assumptions can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates we consider accounting estimates to be critical if both i the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and ii the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to the company’s financial condition our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition inventory pension and other postretirement benefit costs goodwill other intangible assets and longlived assets and income taxes 

  

management of the company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of the company’s board of directors 

  

revenue recognition 

revenues from product sales are recognized upon transfer of ownership including passage of title to the customer and transfer of the risk of loss related to those goods in the americas region sales are generally recognized at the time the product is shipped to the customer and in the europe the middle east  africa and asiapacific regions sales are generally recognized based upon the customer’s receipt in certain circumstances transfer of title takes place at the point of sale for example at our retail stores 

  

revenues are reported on a net sales basis which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual product returns received discounts incentive arrangements with retailers and an amount established for anticipated product returns our practice is to accept product returns from retailers only if properly requested authorized and approved in accepting returns we typically provide a credit to the retailer against accounts receivable from that retailer as a percentage of gross sales returns were 33 in fiscal 2013 and 35 in fiscal 2012 and 2011 

  

our sales return accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net sales this accrual is calculated based on a history of actual returns estimated future returns and information provided by retailers regarding their inventory levels consideration of these factors results in an accrual for anticipated sales returns that reflects increases or decreases related to seasonal fluctuations experience has shown a relationship between retailer inventory levels and sales returns in the subsequent period as well as a consistent pattern of returns due to the seasonal nature of our business in addition as necessary specific accruals may be established for significant future known or anticipated events the types of known or anticipated events that we have considered and will continue to consider include but are not limited to the financial condition of our customers store closings by retailers changes in the retail environment and our decision to continue to support new and existing products 

  

in the ordinary course of business we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions based upon the evaluation of accounts receivable aging specific exposures and historical trends our allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net earnings the allowance for doubtful accounts was 227 million and 311 million as of june 30 2013 and 2012 respectively the allowance for doubtful accounts was reduced by 230 million 138 million and 99 million for customer deductions and writeoffs in fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively and increased by 146 million 110 million and 95 million for additional provisions in fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

  

inventory 

we state our inventory at the lower of cost or fairmarket value with cost being based on standard cost which approximates actual cost on the firstin firstout fifo method we believe this method most closely matches the flow of our products from manufacture through sale the reported net value of our inventory includes saleable products promotional products raw materials and componentry and work in process that will be sold or used in future periods inventory cost includes raw materials direct labor and overhead as well as inbound freight manufacturing overhead is allocated to the cost of inventory based on the normal production capacity unallocated overhead during periods of abnormally low production levels are recognized as cost of sales in the period in which they are incurred 

  

we also record an inventory obsolescence reserve which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated realizable value based on various product sales projections this reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales in addition and as necessary we may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events 

  

 21  

  

pension and other postretirement benefit costs 

we offer the following benefits to some or all of our employees a domestic trustbased noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan “us qualified plan” and an unfunded nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations collectively with the us qualified plan the “domestic plans” a domestic contributory defined contribution plan international pension plans which vary by country consisting of both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans deferred compensation arrangements and certain other postretirement benefit plans 

  

the amounts needed to fund future payouts under our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans are subject to numerous assumptions and variables certain significant variables require us to make assumptions that are within our control such as an anticipated discount rate expected rate of return on plan assets and future compensation levels we evaluate these assumptions with our actuarial advisors and select assumptions that we believe reflect the economics underlying our pension and postretirement obligations while we believe these assumptions are within accepted industry ranges an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a direct impact on reported net earnings 

  

the discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated longterm bonds for fiscal 2013 we used a discount rate for our domestic plans of 390 and varying rates on our international plans of between 100 and 700 the discount rate for our domestic plans is based on a bond portfolio that includes only longterm bonds with an aa rating or equivalent from a major rating agency as of june 30 2013 we used an abovemean yield curve rather than the broadbased yield curve we used before because we believe it represents a better estimate of an effective settlement rate of the obligation and the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio are expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of our domestic plans the benefit obligation of our domestic plans would have been higher by approximately 34 million at june 30 2013 had we not used the abovemean yield curve for our international plans the discount rate in a particular country was principally determined based on a yield curve constructed from high quality corporate bonds in each country with the resulting portfolio having a duration matching that particular plan 

  

for fiscal 2013 we used an expected return on plan assets of 750 for our us qualified plan and varying rates of between 225 and 700 for our international plans in determining the longterm rate of return for a plan we consider the historical rates of return the nature of the plan’s investments and an expectation for the plan’s investment strategies see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 12 – pension deferred compensation and postretirement benefit plans ” for details regarding the nature of our pension and postretirement plan investments the difference between actual and expected return on plan assets is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income those gainslosses that are subject to amortization over future periods will be recognized as a component of the net periodic benefit cost in such future periods for fiscal 2013 our pension plans had actual return on assets of approximately 74 million as compared with expected return on assets of approximately 64 million the resulting net deferred gain of approximately 10 million when combined with gains and losses from previous years will be amortized over periods ranging from approximately 7 to 22 years the actual return on plan assets from our international pension plans exceeded expectations primarily reflecting a strong performance from fixed income and equity investments the lower than expected return on assets from our us qualified plan was primarily due to weakness in our fixed income investments partially offset by our strong equity returns 

  

a 25 basispoint change in the discount rate or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have had the following effect on fiscal 2013 pension expense 

  

   

our postretirement plans are comprised of health care plans that could be impacted by health care cost trend rates which may have a significant effect on the amounts reported a onepercentagepoint change in assumed health care cost trend rates for fiscal 2013 would have had the following effects 

  

   

 22  

  

to determine the fiscal 2014 net periodic benefit cost we are using discount rates of 490 and 430 for the us qualified plan and the nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan respectively and varying rates for our international plans of between 100 and 725 we are using an expected return on plan assets of 750 for the us qualified plan and varying rates for our international pension plans of between 225 and 725 the net change in these assumptions from those used in fiscal 2013 will result in a decrease in pension expense of approximately 5 million in fiscal 2014 of which approximately 3 million is attributable to using the abovemean yield curve for our domestic plans as previously discussed 

  

goodwill other intangible assets and longlived assets 

goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets other indefinitelived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized 

  

we assess goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles at least annually for impairment as of the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which is one level below our operating segments we identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and management of each reporting unit regularly reviews the operating results of those components we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to determine carrying values for our reporting units impairment testing is performed in two steps i we determine if an indication of impairment exists by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value and ii if there is an impairment we measure the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill the impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets encompasses calculating a fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value if the carrying value exceeds the fair value an impairment charge is recorded 

  

testing goodwill for impairment requires us to estimate fair values of reporting units using significant estimates and assumptions the assumptions made will impact the outcome and ultimate results of the testing we use industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and in certain instances we engage thirdparty valuation specialists for advice to determine fair value of the reporting unit we generally use an equal weighting of the income and market approaches in certain circumstances equal weighting will not be applied if one of these methods may be less applicable eg only the income approach would be used for reporting units with existing negative margins we believe both approaches are equally relevant and the most reliable indications of fair value because the fair value of product or service companies is more dependent on the ability to generate earnings than on the value of the assets used in the production process 

  

under the income approach we determine fair value using a discounted cash flow method projecting future cash flows of each reporting unit as well as a terminal value and discounting such cash flows at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows under the market approach we utilize information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units which creates valuation multiples that are applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested to value the reporting unit 

  

the key estimates and factors used in these two approaches include but are not limited to revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts terminal value the weightedaverage cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and comparable market multiples the following fiscal 2013 estimates and factors exclude those related to our darphin reporting unit for which we recorded an impairment charge of the remainder of its goodwill see goodwill and other intangible asset impairments  the fiscal 2013 compound annual growth rate of sales for the first five to eight years of our projections as considered appropriate for the individual reporting units ranged between 5 and 22 with the higher growth rates in certain of the company’s smaller reporting units that are expected to continue the growth that they have exhibited over the past several years the fiscal 2012 compound annual growth rate of sales for the first five to eight years of our projections ranged between 5 and 18 with the higher growth rates in those reporting units that start with the smallest base in fiscal 2012 for reporting units with positive earnings growth in the corresponding earnings before interest and taxes ranged from 7 to 49 in fiscal 2013 as compared with 7 to 47 in fiscal 2012 the terminal growth rates were projected at 3 after five to eight years in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 which reflects our estimate of long term market and gross domestic product growth the weightedaverage cost of capital used to discount future cash flows ranged from 8 to 15 in fiscal 2013 as compared with 8 to 16 in fiscal 2012 the range of market multiples used in our fiscal 2013 impairment testing was from 15 to 35 times trailingtwelvemonth sales and 85 to 130 times trailingtwelvemonth earnings before interest taxes and depreciation and amortization the range of market multiples used in our fiscal 2012 impairment testing was from 17 to 33 times trailingtwelvemonth sales and between 100 to 125 times trailingtwelvemonth earnings before interest taxes and depreciation and amortization future changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the results of our reviews for impairment of goodwill however a decrease of 100 basis points in our terminal growth rate or an increase of 100 basis points in our weightedaverage cost of capital would still result in a fair value calculation exceeding our book value for each of our reporting units changes in the valuation assumptions from those used in the prior year primarily reflect the impact of the current economic environment on the reporting units and their projected future results of operations 

  

 23  

  

to determine fair value of other indefinitelived intangible assets we use an income approach the relieffromroyalty method this method assumes that in lieu of ownership a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to obtain the rights to use the comparable asset other indefinitelived intangible assets’ fair values require significant judgments in determining both the assets’ estimated cash flows as well as the appropriate discount and royalty rates applied to those cash flows to determine fair value changes in such estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results the following fiscal 2013 estimates exclude those related to the darphin trademark for which we recorded an impairment charge for its remaining carrying value see goodwill and other intangible asset impairments  the fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 terminal growth rate applied to future cash flows was 3 and the fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 discount rates ranged from 10 to 18 the fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 royalty rates ranged from 05 to 12 

  

we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable when such events or changes in circumstances occur a recoverability test is performed comparing projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset or asset group to its carrying value if the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value an impairment would be recorded for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value which is determined by discounting future cash flows 

  

income taxes 

we account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns as of june 30 2013 we have current net deferred tax assets of 2960 million and noncurrent net deferred tax assets of 503 million the net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization as well as the continued application of currently anticipated tax rates included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance of 929 million for deferred tax assets where management believes it is morelikelythannot that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the relevant jurisdiction based on our assessments no additional valuation allowance is required if we determine that a deferred tax asset will not be realizable an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will result in a reduction of net earnings at that time 

  

we provide tax reserves for us federal state local and foreign exposures relating to periods subject to audit the development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues potential outcomes and timing and is a subjective critical estimate we assess our tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting dates for those tax positions where it is morelikelythannot that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those tax positions where it is not morelikelythannot that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements we classify applicable interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes although the outcome relating to these exposures is uncertain in management’s opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating from these exposures if actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates they could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations 

  

quantitative analysis 

during the threeyear period ended june 30 2013 there have not been material changes in the assumptions underlying these critical accounting policies nor to the related significant estimates the results of our business underlying these assumptions have not differed significantly from our expectations 

  

while we believe that the estimates that we have made are proper and the related results of operations for the period are presented fairly in all material respects other assumptions could reasonably be justified that would change the amount of reported net sales cost of sales operating expenses or our provision for income taxes as they relate to the provisions for anticipated sales returns allowance for doubtful accounts inventory obsolescence reserve and income taxes for fiscal 2013 had these estimates been changed simultaneously by 25 in either direction our reported gross profit would have increased or decreased by approximately 63 million operating expenses would have changed by approximately 08 million and the provision for income taxes would have increased or decreased by approximately 07 million the collective impact of these changes on operating income net earnings attributable to the estée lauder companies inc and net earnings attributable to the estée lauder companies inc per diluted common share would be an increase or decrease of approximately 71 million 64 million and 02 respectively

results of operations 

we manufacture market and sell beauty products including those in the skin care makeup fragrance and hair care categories which are distributed in over 150 countries and territories the following table is a comparative summary of operating results for fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 and reflects the basis of presentation described in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 2 – summary of significant accounting policies and note 19 – segment data and related information ” for all periods presented products and services that do not meet our definition of skin care makeup fragrance and hair care have been included in the “other” category

the following table presents certain consolidated earnings data as a percentage of net sales 

  

   

in order to meet the demands of consumers we continually introduce new products support new and established products through advertising merchandising and sampling and phase out existing products that no longer meet the needs of our consumers or our objectives the economics of developing producing launching supporting and discontinuing products impact our sales and operating performance each period the introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products which we take into account in our business planning 

  

we operate on a global basis with the majority of our net sales generated outside the united states accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our results of operations therefore we present certain net sales information excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations to provide a framework for assessing the performance of our underlying business outside the united states constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant periodoverperiod we calculate constant currency information by translating current year results using prior year weightedaverage foreign currency exchange rates 

  

overview 

we believe that the best way to continue to increase stockholder value is to provide our customers and consumers with the products and services that they have come to expect from us in the most efficient and profitable manner while recognizing consumers’ changing shopping habits to be the global leader in prestige beauty we continued to implement a longterm strategy that is guiding us through fiscal 2016 the strategy has numerous initiatives across geographic regions product categories brands and functions that are designed to leverage our strengths make us more productive and grow our sales 

  

we have a strong diverse and highly valuable brand portfolio with global reach and potential and we plan to continue building upon and leveraging our history of outstanding creativity innovation and entrepreneurship we have succeeded in expanding our distinctive “hightouch” service model and will continue to look for ways to further evolve it within our channels of distribution and geographic regions as an example we continue to develop capabilities to deliver superior retailing experiences particularly in freestanding stores we continue to increase brand awareness by expanding our efforts to evolve our online strategy into a multipronged digital strategy encompassing ecommerce and mcommerce as well as digital and social media we are leveraging our regional organization in an effort to assure that we are locally relevant with our products services marketing and visual merchandising 

  

as part of our strategy we are positioning ourselves to capitalize on opportunities in the fastestgrowing areas in prestige beauty skin care our most profitable product category continues to be a strategic priority for our innovation and investment spending particularly in the asiapacific region we are also focusing our attention on luxury consumers across all product categories and have seen continued strength in the net sales of many of our higherend prestige products we will also continue to build our makeup product category through the introduction of new product offerings reemphasize our focus on fragrance innovation to drive profitable growth and expand our hair care brands both in salons and in other retail channels 

  

 26  

  

we are strengthening our geographic presence by seeking share growth in large imagebuilding cities within core markets such as the united states the united kingdom france italy and japan in addition we continue to prioritize efforts to expand our presence and accelerate share growth in emerging markets such as china the middle east eastern europe and brazil and focus on consumers who purchase in the travel retail channel in stores at their travel destinations or when they return to their home market we also continue to expand our digital presence which has resulted in growth in the net sales of our products sold online in north america we continue to implement programs to drive profitable growth in our traditional department store channel at the same time we are also expanding our presence in other channels such as specialty retailers freestanding stores and online internationally we continue to take actions to grow in european perfumeries and pharmacies and in department stores in asia in addition we are emphasizing our skin care and makeup initiatives to boost our travel retail business and continuing efforts to grow our freestanding store online specialty retailer and prestige salon businesses the travel retail business continues to be an important source of sales growth and profitability our business in this channel has benefited from the implementation of programs we designed to target consumers in distinct travel corridors enhance consumers’ “hightouch” experiences and convert travelers into purchasers 

  

while our overall business is performing well we are seeing continued weakness in certain southern european countries and korea due to challenging economic environments in korea we are also seeing competitive pressures in prestige beauty elsewhere we are cautious of a slowing retail environment in the united states in the short term and a slowing of the future growth trend in china during the first half of fiscal 2013 we also saw a slowing in the exceptional growth we had experienced in fiscal 2012 in travel retail due in part to select retailer destocking to enable tighter working capital management however our sales growth in the channel has since improved and we expect this trend to continue into fiscal 2014 we believe we have and will continue to offset to some extent the impact of these events as a result of our strategy to mitigate weaknesses we find in certain areas with strengths in others however if economic conditions or the degree of uncertainty or volatility worsen or the adverse conditions previously discussed are further prolonged then we expect there to be a negative effect on ongoing consumer confidence demand and spending and as a result our business we will continue to monitor these and other risks that may affect our business our venezuelan subsidiary has been operating in a highly inflationary economy since january 2010 in february 2013 the venezuelan government announced the devaluation of its currency the bolivar fuerte this devaluation did not have a significant impact on our business or our consolidated financial statements for the year ended june 30 2013 we do not expect this devaluation to have a significant impact on our ongoing future consolidated net sales or operating income however any further devaluation could have a negative effect on our local business 

  

we plan to continue to invest in the significant modernization of our global information systems which includes the strategic modernization initiative “smi” as well as other initiatives as part of smi we anticipate the continued migration of our operations to sapbased technologies with the majority of our locations being enabled through calendar 2014 during the fiscal 2013 third quarter smi implementation of the global supply planning component challenges emerged which caused some customer service delays and certain products to be out of stock as a result we decided to defer the previously scheduled january 2014 smi implementation by six months subsequently we resolved the smirelated challenges so that customer service delays and products out of stock related to this rollout have improved as expected these challenges did not have a significant impact on our business or our consolidated financial results for the year ended june 30 2013 we expect our initiatives should over time provide for overall profitability improvements by enhancing gross margin and supporting efficiencies in select operating expenses which should enable us to strategically reinvest our savings in activities that will support our future growth 

  

looking ahead to fiscal 2014 we plan to continue building on our strengths and our heritage of innovation to bring unique and highperformance products with longterm appeal and enduring quality to our consumers we expect our strategy will enable us to continue to succeed in high growth channels benefit from regional opportunities focus on emerging market consumers and enhance our local relevance we plan on continuing to bring highly innovative products to consumers and elevating our personalized “hightouch” philosophy through customization with key retailers expansion in freestanding stores and extending it to fastgrowing digital platforms we remain dedicated to investing in select areas to improve our capabilities or develop new ones our main focuses are accelerating our digital capabilities research and development product innovation consumer insight and local relevance 

  

returns and charges associated with restructuring activities 

in an effort to drive down costs and achieve synergies within our organization in february 2009 we announced the implementation of a multifaceted cost savings program the “program” to position the company to achieve longterm profitable growth we anticipated the program would result in total cumulative restructuring charges and other costs to implement those initiatives of between 350 million and 450 million before taxes during the second quarter of fiscal 2013 we closed the program we concluded the approval of all initiatives under the program and anticipate commencing the execution of those initiatives through fiscal 2014 as a result of the closure of the program and evaluation of the initiatives that have been implemented as of june 30 2013 we anticipate total cumulative restructuring charges and other costs to implement those initiatives to total between 320 million and 330 million and that such charges have been substantially recorded through fiscal 2013 we will continue to monitor the progress of these initiatives and revise estimates as appropriate 

  

 27  

  

the following is a reconciliation of cumulative approved charges under the program as compared with the revised estimated charges related to initiatives under the program and total cumulative charges incurred through june 30 2013 

  

   

we estimate that the implementation of this program combined with other ongoing cost savings efforts resulted in savings of approximately 780 million through the end of fiscal 2013 which included the reduction of certain costs relative to an assumed normalized spending pattern any changes from adjustments of estimated costs as referenced above have been included within our estimated savings our longrange forecast for operating margin reflects these anticipated savings net of strategic reinvestments 

  

the program focused on a redesign of our organizational structure in order to integrate the company in a more cohesive way and operate more globally across brands and functions the principal aspect of the program was the reduction of the workforce by approximately 2000 employees specific actions taken since program inception included 

  

·   resize and reorganize the organization – we continued the realignment and optimization of our organization to better leverage scale improve productivity reduce complexity and achieve cost savings in each region and across various functions this included reduction of the workforce which occurred through the consolidation of certain functions which we achieved through a combination of normal attrition and job eliminations and the closure and consolidation of certain distribution and office facilities as of june 30 2013 we identified approximately 14 million of previouslyapproved restructuring costs that will not be incurred related to these activities primarily as a result of certain employees relocating to other available positions within the company 

  

·   turnaround or exit unprofitable operations – to improve the profitability in certain of our brands and regions we have selectively exited certain channels of distribution categories and markets and have made changes to turn around others this included the exit from the global wholesale distribution of our prescriptives brand the reformulation of ojon brand products and the exit from the global distribution of sean john products in connection with these activities we incurred charges for product returns inventory writeoffs reduction of workforce and termination of contracts as of june 30 2013 we identified approximately 21 million of previouslyapproved returns and other costs related to these activities that will not be incurred primarily as a result of betterthanexpected sales of products prior to the exit of the operations as well as lower employeerelated and store closure costs than originally estimated 

  

·   outsourcing – in order to balance the growing need for information technology support with our efforts to provide the most efficient and cost effective solutions we continued the outsourcing of certain information technology processes we incurred costs to transition services to outsource providers and employeerelated termination costs as of june 30 2013 we identified approximately 26 million of previouslyapproved outsourcing initiatives for information technology services stemming from the decision not to implement certain aspects of these initiatives as well as lower costs than originally anticipated to transition services on initiatives that were implemented

restructuring charges 

  

the following table presents aggregate restructuring charges related to the program to date 

  

   

the following table presents accrued restructuring charges and the related activities under the program to date 

  

   

accrued restructuring charges at june 30 2013 are expected to result in cash expenditures funded from cash provided by operations of approximately 23 million in fiscal 2014 and 5 million in fiscal 2015 

  

 29  

  

total returns and other charges associated with restructuring activities 

  

the following table presents total returns and charges associated with restructuring and other activities related to the program 

  

   

during fiscal 2013 we recorded 15 million reflecting sales returns less related cost of sales of 02 million and a writeoff of inventory of 14 million associated with exiting unprofitable operations 

  

during fiscal 2012 we recorded 21 million reflecting sales returns less related cost of sales of 03 million and a writeoff of inventory of 18 million associated with exiting unprofitable operations

other charges in connection with the implementation of the program primarily relate to consulting and other professional services 

  

goodwill and other intangible asset impairments 

as of our annual stepone goodwill impairment test on april 1 2013 all reporting units’ fair values substantially exceeded their respective carrying values with the exception of our darphin reporting unit as a result we recorded an impairment charge for the remainder of the goodwill related to the darphin reporting unit of 96 million the fair value of the reporting unit was based upon the income approach utilizing estimated cash flows and a terminal value discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of cash flows as of our annual indefinitelived asset impairment test on april 1 2013 the fair values of all other indefinitelived intangible assets substantially exceeded their respective carrying values with the exception of our darphin trademark we determined that the carrying value of this trademark exceeded its estimated fair value which was based on the relieffromroyalty method as a result we recognized an impairment charge of 81 million for the remaining carrying value of the related trademark these impairment charges were reflected in the skin care product category and in the europe the middle east  africa region 

  

we will continue to monitor and evaluate the potential impact of the volatility of global economic conditions and uncertainties on our business and on our annual impairment testing accordingly it is possible that we could recognize an impairment charge in the future with respect to goodwill other intangible assets andor longlived assets 

  

fiscal 2013 as compared with fiscal 2012 

  

net sales 

  

net sales increased 5 or 4681 million to 101817 million reflecting growth in all of our major product categories within each geographic region excluding the impact of foreign currency translation net sales increased 6 

  

the following discussions of net sales by product categories and geographic regions exclude the impact of returns associated with restructuring activities of 15 million and 21 million recorded during fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 respectively we believe the following analysis of net sales better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business 

  

product categories 

  

skin care 

net sales of skin care products increased 6 or 2401 million to 44653 million the recent launches of perfectionist cpr advanced time zone advanced night repair eye serum infusion and the optimizer line of products from estée lauder contributed approximately 273 million combined to the increase also contributing approximately 99 million combined to the increase were the recent launches of the moisturizing soft cream from la mer and even better eyes dark circle corrector from clinique partially offsetting these increases were lower sales of perfectionist cp serum and time zone as well as idealist even skintone illuminator which was a new launch in the prior year from estée lauder of approximately 162 million combined excluding the impact of foreign currency translation skin care net sales increased 7 

  

 30  

  

makeup 

makeup net sales increased 5 or 1801 million to 38769 million primarily reflecting an increase in net sales from our makeup artist brands of approximately 156 million combined the recent launches of high impact extreme volume mascara and chubby stick intense from clinique and pure color vivid shine lipstick from estée lauder contributed approximately 47 million of incremental sales combined to the increase partially offsetting these increases were lower sales of repairwear laser focus makeup from clinique and pure color eyeshadow and doublewear stayinplace makeup from estée lauder all of which were new launches in the prior year of approximately 45 million combined excluding the impact of foreign currency translation makeup net sales increased 6 

  

fragrance 

net sales of fragrance products increased 3 or 398 million to 13108 million incremental sales from the recent launches of zegna uomo dkny be delicious so intense tommy hilfiger freedom men and coach love contributed approximately 30 million combined to the increase higher sales of jo malone and tom ford fragrances contributed approximately 60 million combined to the increase these increases were partially offset by lower sales of estée lauder sensuous nude and dkny golden delicious both of which were new launches in the prior year as well as puredkny of approximately 52 million combined excluding the impact of foreign currency translation fragrance net sales increased 4 

  

hair care 

hair care net sales increased 6 or 265 million to 4889 million primarily reflecting the continued success of the invati line of products and recent launches of pure abundance style prep and be curly curl controller from aveda the category also benefited from sales generated from expanded global distribution in particular to salons for aveda and multibrand specialty retailers for bumble and bumble partially offsetting these increases were lower sales of bumble and bumble brand products to salons and lower net sales of ojon brand products due in part to a reduction in our business in the drtv channel the impact of foreign currency translation on hair care net sales was de minimis 

  

geographic regions 

  

net sales in the americas increased 5 or 2018 million to 43029 million the increase during the current year was primarily attributable to growth in the united states of approximately 172 million due in large part to product offerings from our heritage and makeup artist brands net sales in canada increased approximately 13 million primarily reflecting increased sales from certain of our heritage brands as a result of expanded distribution these increases also reflect the efforts of our expanded pullpush activities which include innovative advertising that continues to draw new consumers to our brands and our ongoing efforts to work with retailers in the united states and canada on strengthening the “hightouch” concepts used to help market our products we are cautious of a slowing retail environment in the united states in the short term net sales in latin america increased approximately 19 million led by venezuela and mexico the impact of foreign currency translation on net sales in the americas was de minimis 

  

in europe the middle east  africa net sales increased 4 or 1555 million to 37587 million primarily reflecting higher sales from our travel retail business and in the united kingdom and the middle east of approximately 185 million combined the net sales increase in our travel retail business primarily reflected a strong retail environment for our products new product launches and to a lesser extent an increase in global airline passenger traffic higher sales in the united kingdom were primarily driven by our makeup artist brands and new product launches from certain of our heritage brands in addition the united kingdom benefited from increased sales of certain of our luxury fragrance and skin care products higher sales in the middle east were primarily driven by our makeup artist brands and sales of luxury fragrances these increases in the region were partially offset by lower net sales in spain russia switzerland and the balkans of approximately 45 million combined with the exception of russia these lower net sales reflected the challenging economic environments in certain countries in europe accordingly we remain cautious in the near term the lower net sales in russia primarily reflected destocking associated with ongoing challenges with a certain customer the overall change in europe the middle east  africa net sales was inclusive of unfavorable exchange rates due to the strengthening of the us dollar against most currencies in this region of approximately 75 million excluding the impact of foreign currency translation net sales in europe the middle east  africa increased 6 

  

net sales in asiapacific increased 5 or 1102 million to 21216 million primarily reflecting growth in our sales of skin care products in line with our strategy we increased sales by approximately 160 million in china and hong kong net sales in china benefited from expanded distribution while we gained share in the prestige business in china we are cautious that a slowing of the future growth trend of the chinese economy may temper our retail sales growth including that of our travel retail business higher sales in hong kong were primarily driven by launches from our heritage brands and higherend prestige skin care products these increases were partially offset by lower net sales in korea and japan of approximately 66 million combined the lower net sales in korea primarily reflected a challenging economic environment and continued competitive pressures facing prestige beauty in korea the decline in japan was driven by the weakening of the japanese yen excluding the impact of foreign currency translation net sales in asiapacific increased 6 

  

we strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market which may account for differences in regional sales growth 

  

 31  

  

cost of sales 

  

cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales decreased to 199 as compared with 205 in the prior year this improvement reflected changes in the mix of our business and pricing of approximately 40 basis points favorable manufacturing variances of approximately 20 basis points and the favorable effect of exchange rates of approximately 10 basis points these improvements were partially offset by a provision for foreign transactional taxes of approximately 10 basis points 

  

since certain promotional activities are a component of sales or cost of sales and the timing and level of promotions vary with our promotional calendar we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in the cost of sales percentage in addition future cost of sales mix may be impacted by the inclusion of potential new brands or channels of distribution that have margin and product cost structures different from those of our current mix of business 

  

operating expenses 

  

operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 651 as compared with 660 in the prior year this improvement reflected a decrease in general and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales of approximately 50 basis points a decrease in charges associated with restructuring activities of approximately 40 basis points and lower selling and shipping costs as a percentage of net sales of 10 basis points also included in this improvement was a favorable change in foreign exchange transactions of approximately 10 basis points and lower charges associated with other intangible asset impairments of approximately 10 basis points partially offsetting these improvements were higher costs related to stockbased compensation of approximately 20 basis points and increased spending on advertising merchandising and sampling in line with our strategy of approximately 10 basis points 

  

changes in advertising merchandising and sampling spending result from the type timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts as well as the markets being emphasized 

  

operating results 

  

operating income increased 16 or 2143 million to 15260 million operating margin increased to 150 of net sales as compared with 135 in the prior year reflecting our higher gross margin and the decrease in our operating expense margin as previously discussed the following discussions of operating results by product categories and geographic regions exclude the impact of total returns and charges associated with restructuring activities of 178 million or 02 of net sales in fiscal 2013 and 632 million or 07 of net sales in fiscal 2012 we believe the following analysis of operating results better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business 

  

product categories 

  

skin care operating income increased 11 or 834 million to 8301 million primarily reflecting improved results from highermargin product launches from estée lauder and la mer partially offset by goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of 177 million makeup operating income increased 8 or 424 million to 5804 million primarily reflecting improved results from our m ž a ž c brand partially offset by certain of our heritage brands and an increase in investment spending in line with our strategy fragrance operating income increased 20 or 202 million to 1203 million primarily reflecting increased profitability from certain jo malone estée lauder and clinique products partially offset by lower results from certain of our designer fragrances hair care operating results increased over 100 or 145 million to 267 million due to a favorable comparison to the prior year which was impacted by other intangible asset impairment charges of 217 million partially offset by lower sales of bumble and bumble brand products and higher investment spending by aveda to support the invati line of products 

  

geographic regions 

  

operating income in the americas increased 47 or 1348 million to 4232 million primarily reflecting improved results from our makeup artist and luxury brands and certain of our hair care and heritage brands driven by improved category mix partially offset by the timing and level of strategic investment spending in the current year 

  

in europe the middle east  africa operating income increased 9 or 671 million to 8134 million higher results from our travel retail business the middle east and the united kingdom totaled approximately 77 million combined partially offsetting these improvements were lower results in germany and spain of approximately 5 million combined as well as goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of 177 million 

  

in asiapacific operating income decreased 10 or 330 million to 3072 million higher results from china and thailand totaled approximately 22 million combined these higher results were more than offset by lower operating results of approximately 51 million in korea hong kong and japan combined the lower results in hong kong were due in part to investment spending to support new product launches 

  

interest expense net 

  

net interest expense was 548 million as compared with 611 million in the prior year interest expense decreased primarily due to the refinancing of debt at lower rates 

  

 32  

  

interest expense on debt extinguishment 

  

during the first quarter of fiscal 2013 we redeemed the 2301 million principal amount of our 775 senior notes due 2013 at a price of 108 of the principal amount we recorded a pretax expense on the extinguishment of debt of 191 million representing the call premium of 186 million and the prorata writeoff of 05 million of issuance costs and debt discount 

  

other income 

  

in december 2012 we amended the agreement related to the august 2007 sale of rodan  fields a brand then owned by us to receive a fixed amount in lieu of future contingent consideration and other rights accordingly we recognized 224 million net of discount of 04 million which has been classified as other income in our consolidated statements of earnings prior to this amendment we earned and received 07 million of contingent consideration 

  

in november 2011 we settled a commercial dispute with third parties that was outside our normal operations in connection therewith we received a 105 million cash payment which has been classified as other income in our consolidated statement of earnings 

  

provision for income taxes 

  

the provision for income taxes represents us federal foreign state and local income taxes the effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state and local income taxes the taxation of foreign income and income tax reserve adjustments which represent changes in our net liability for unrecognized tax benefits including tax settlements and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations our effective tax rate will change from year to year based on recurring and nonrecurring factors including but not limited to the geographical mix of earnings enacted tax legislation state and local income taxes tax reserve adjustments the ultimate disposition of deferred tax assets relating to stockbased compensation and the interaction of various global tax strategies 

  

the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2013 was 306 as compared with 318 in the prior year the decrease in the effective income tax rate of 120 basis points was principally due to a decrease in the effective tax rate of our foreign operations as compared with the prior year as well as the retroactive reinstatement of the us federal research and development tax credit signed into law on january 2 2013

net sales 

  

net sales increased 10 or 9036 million to 97136 million reflecting growth in all of our major product categories within each geographic region the impact of foreign currency translation on net sales was de minimis 

  

the following discussions of net sales by product categories and geographic regions exclude the impact of returns associated with restructuring activities of 21 million and 46 million recorded during fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 respectively we believe the following analysis of net sales better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business

geographic regions 

  

net sales in the americas increased 8 or 3048 million to 41011 million the increase in fiscal 2012 was primarily attributable to growth in the united states of approximately 257 million primarily due to new product offerings from our heritage and makeup artist brands as well as an increase in sales of our higherend prestige skin care products these increases reflect in part our ongoing efforts to work with retailers in the us department store channel on strengthening the “hightouch” concepts used to help market our products net sales in latin america increased approximately 30 million primarily reflecting growth in brazil and chile net sales in canada increased approximately 19 million primarily reflecting increased sales from our heritage and makeup artist brands the impact of foreign currency translation on net sales in the americas was de minimis

we strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market which may account for differences in regional sales growth 

  

cost of sales 

  

cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales decreased to 205 as compared with 220 in fiscal 2011 this improvement primarily reflected our efforts in connection with the program including strategic changes in the mix of our business and pricing of approximately 140 basis points favorable manufacturing variances of approximately 10 basis points and the favorable effect of exchange rates of approximately 10 basis points these improvements were partially offset by an increase in obsolescence charges of approximately 10 basis points 

  

 34  

  

operating expenses 

  

operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 660 as compared with 656 in fiscal 2011 this change reflected increased spending in advertising merchandising and sampling costs in line with our strategy of approximately 80 basis points higher costs related to stockbased compensation of approximately 20 basis points an increase in general and administrative costs of approximately 10 basis points and higher charges associated with restructuring activities of approximately 10 basis points partially offsetting these changes were lower selling and shipping costs as a percentage of net sales of approximately 50 basis points lower charges associated with goodwill and other intangible asset impairments of approximately 20 basis points and a favorable change in foreign exchange transactions of approximately 10 basis points 

  

changes in advertising merchandising and sampling spending result from the type timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts as well as the markets being emphasized 

  

operating results 

  

operating income increased 20 or 2223 million to 13117 million operating margin increased to 135 of net sales as compared with 124 in fiscal 2011 reflecting our higher gross margin partially offset by the increase in our operating expense margin as previously discussed the following discussions of operating results by product categories and geographic regions exclude the impact of total returns and charges associated with restructuring activities of 632 million or 07 of net sales in fiscal 2012 and 594 million or 07 of net sales in fiscal 2011 we believe the following analysis of operating results better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business 

  

product categories 

  

skin care operating income increased 25 or 1516 million to 7467 million primarily reflecting improved results from highermargin product launches from certain of our heritage brands as well as increased results from higherend prestige skin care products makeup operating income increased 9 or 442 million to 5380 million primarily reflecting improved results from our makeup artist brands both our skin care and makeup categories were impacted by higher investment spending on global advertising merchandising and sampling to support major launches and existing franchises in line with our strategy fragrance operating income increased 24 or 194 million to 1001 million primarily reflecting improved cost of goods and a more strategically focused approach to spending from our heritage brands as part of our strategy to improve profitability hair care operating results increased over 100 or 213 million to 122 million primarily reflecting expanded global distribution improved results driven by new product launches as well as a favorable comparison to fiscal 2011 which was impacted by higher goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of 15 million 

  

geographic regions 

  

operating income in the americas increased 18 or 435 million to 2884 million primarily reflecting improved results from our heritage and makeup artist brands that were driven by improved category mix as well as a favorable comparison to fiscal 2011 which was impacted by higher goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of 16 million partially offsetting these improvements was the level of strategic investment spending in fiscal 2012 

  

in europe the middle east  africa operating income increased 14 or 944 million to 7463 million higher results from our travel retail business and the middle east totaled approximately 109 million combined partially offsetting these improvements were lower results in russia and france of approximately 28 million combined the lower results in russia primarily reflected strategic investment spending to support this emerging market coupled with a decrease in sales as a result of destocking associated with ongoing challenges with a certain customer the lower results in france primarily reflected strategic investment spending 

  

in asiapacific operating income increased 35 or 882 million to 3402 million most countries in the region reported higher operating results led by approximately 70 million in hong kong china japan and korea combined 

  

interest expense net 

  

net interest expense was 611 million as compared with 639 million in fiscal 2011 interest expense decreased due to the replacement of our 600 senior notes in january 2012 with commercial paper 

  

provision for income taxes 

  

the provision for income taxes represents us federal foreign state and local income taxes the effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state and local income taxes the taxation of foreign income and income tax reserve adjustments which represent changes in our net liability for unrecognized tax benefits including tax settlements and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations our effective tax rate will change from year to year based on recurring and nonrecurring factors including but not limited to the geographical mix of earnings enacted tax legislation state and local income taxes tax reserve adjustments the ultimate disposition of deferred tax assets relating to stockbased compensation and the interaction of various global tax strategies 

  

 35  

  

the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2012 was 318 as compared with 314 in fiscal 2011 the increase in the effective income tax rate of 40 basis points was principally due to a decrease in favorable tax reserve adjustments as compared with fiscal 2011 partially offset by a lower effective tax rate related to our foreign operations 

  

net earnings attributable to the estÉe lauder companies inc 

  

net earnings attributable to the estée lauder companies inc as compared with fiscal 2011 increased 22 or 1561 million to 8569 million and diluted net earnings per common share increased 24 from 174 to 216 the results in fiscal 2012 include the impact of total returns and charges associated with restructuring activities of 441 million after tax or 11 per diluted common share the results in fiscal 2011 include the impact of total returns and charges associated with restructuring activities of 417 million after tax or 10 per diluted common share 

  

financial condition 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

overview 

  

our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program borrowings from the issuance of longterm debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks and other lenders in the united states and abroad at june 30 2013 we had cash and cash equivalents of 14957 million compared with 13477 million at june 30 2012 our cash and cash equivalents are maintained at a number of financial institutions as of june 30 2013 less than 1 of the total balance was insured by governmental agencies reflecting the expiration of temporary unlimited deposit insurance provided in the united states to mitigate the risk of uninsured balances we select financial institutions based on their credit ratings and financial strength and perform ongoing evaluations of these institutions to limit our concentration risk exposure 

  

our business is seasonal in nature and accordingly our working capital needs vary from time to time we may enter into investing and financing transactions that require additional funding to the extent that these needs exceed cash from operations we could subject to market conditions issue commercial paper issue longterm debt securities or borrow under our revolving credit facilities 

  

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that cash on hand cash generated from operations available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business operations information systems enhancements capital expenditures potential stock repurchases commitments and other contractual obligations on both a nearterm and longterm basis our cash and cash equivalents balance at june 30 2013 includes approximately 871 million of cash in offshore jurisdictions associated with our permanent reinvestment strategy we do not believe that the indefinite reinvestment of these funds offshore impairs our ability to meet our domestic debt or working capital obligations if these indefinitely reinvested earnings were repatriated into the united states as dividends we would be subject to additional taxes 

  

the effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years generally we have been able to introduce new products at higher prices increase prices and implement other operating efficiencies to sufficiently offset cost increases which have been moderate 

  

credit ratings 

  

changes in our credit ratings will likely result in changes in our borrowing costs our credit ratings also impact the cost of our revolving credit facility as discussed below downgrades in our credit ratings may reduce our ability to issue commercial paper andor longterm debt and would likely increase the relative costs of borrowing a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating as of august 19 2013 our commercial paper is rated a1 by standard  poor’s and p1 by moody’s and our longterm debt is rated a with a stable outlook by standard  poor’s and a2 with a stable outlook by moody’s

in august 2012 we issued 2500 million of 235 senior notes due august 15 2022 “2022 senior notes” and 2500 million of 370 senior notes due august 15 2042 “2042 senior notes” in a public offering the 2022 senior notes were priced at 99911 with a yield of 2360 the 2042 senior notes were priced at 99567 with a yield of 3724 interest payments on both notes are required to be made semiannually on february 15 and august 15 commencing february 15 2013 during the first quarter of fiscal 2013 we used the net proceeds of the offering to redeem the 2301 million principal amount of our 775 senior notes due november 1 2013 at a price of 108 of the principal amount and recorded a pretax expense on the extinguishment of debt of 191 million representing the call premium of 186 million and the prorata writeoff of 05 million of issuance costs and debt discount we used the remaining net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes 

  

we have a commercial paper program under which we may issue commercial paper in the united states in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 we increased the limit of this program from 7500 million to 10 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 we had repaid using cash on hand 2000 million of commercial paper that was outstanding at june 30 2012 at june 30 2013 we had no commercial paper outstanding 

  

we have a 10 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on july 14 2015 the “facility” the facility may be used to provide credit support for our commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes up to the equivalent of 250 million of the facility is available for multicurrency loans the interest rate on borrowings under the facility is based on libor or on the higher of prime which is the rate of interest publicly announced by the administrative agent or ½ plus the federal funds rate we incurred costs of approximately 1 million to establish the facility which are being amortized over the term of the facility the facility has an annual fee of 07 million payable quarterly based on our current credit ratings the facility also contains a crossdefault provision whereby a failure to pay other material financial obligations in excess of 1000 million after grace periods and absent a waiver from the lenders would result in an event of default and the acceleration of the maturity of any outstanding debt under this facility at june 30 2013 no borrowings were outstanding under this agreement 

  

we have a fixed rate promissory note agreement with a financial institution pursuant to which we may borrow up to 1500 million in the form of loan participation notes through one of our subsidiaries in europe the interest rate on borrowings under this agreement is at an allin fixed rate determined by the lender and agreed to by us at the date of each borrowing at june 30 2013 no borrowings were outstanding under this agreement debt issuance costs incurred related to this agreement were de minimis

total debt as a percent of total capitalization excluding noncontrolling interests was 29 at june 30 2013 and 32 at june 30 2012

cash flows 

  

net cash provided by operating activities was 12263 million 11267 million and 10270 million in fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the increase in cash flows from operating activities as compared with fiscal 2012 was primarily driven by an increase in net earnings a decrease in pension and postretirement benefit contributions and a favorable change in accounts receivable due to the timing of shipments and collections these improvements were partially offset by an increase in the levels of inventory primarily to maintain acceptable service levels in line with forecasted sales activity as well as for the remaining safety stock for the smi implementation also offsetting these improvements were a change in accounts payable primarily due to the timing of payments and a decrease in accrued income taxes resulting from the timing and level of tax payments cash flows from operating activities increased in fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 primarily driven by an increase in net earnings favorable levels of accounts payable primarily due to the timing of payments and a decrease in the levels of inventory these improvements were partially offset by the change in other liabilities primarily due to the timing of payments and costs related to employee compensation advertising merchandising and sampling and payroll and other taxes as well as an increase in accounts receivable balances primarily due to the timing of shipments 

  

net cash used for investing activities was 4655 million 4283 million and 6069 million in fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the increase in cash flows used for investing activities as compared with fiscal 2012 primarily reflected higher capital expenditure activity in the current year related to counters and leasehold improvements the decrease in cash flows used for investing activities during fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 primarily reflected a favorable comparison with the fiscal 2011 acquisition of smashbox cosmetics partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures for counters and leasehold improvements 

  

net cash used for financing activities was 6115 million 5851 million and 3131 million in fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the increase in cash used for financing activities as compared with fiscal 2012 primarily reflected the repayment of outstanding commercial paper during the current year higher dividends paid as a result of the increase in the annual dividend rate and transition to a quarterly dividend payout schedule and higher redemptions of longterm debt during the current year partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of the 2022 senior notes and 2042 senior notes in august 2012 and lower treasury stock repurchases the change in net cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 primarily reflected an increase in treasury stock purchases lower net proceeds from employee stock transactions and an increase in the payment of dividends during fiscal 2012 as a result of an increase in the annual dividend rate the repayment of the 2012 senior notes during fiscal 2012 was offset by proceeds from the issuance of shortterm commercial paper subsequent to june 30 2013 we purchased approximately 06 million additional shares of class a common stock for 418 million pursuant to our share repurchase program 

  

dividends 

  

we transitioned to a quarterly dividend payout schedule for our class a and class b common stock beginning in the fiscal 2013 third quarter 

  

the following is a summary of cash dividends declared per share on our class a and class b common stock during the year ended june 30 2013 

  

   

on august 14 2013 a dividend was declared in the amount of 18 per share on our class a and class b common stock the dividend is payable in cash on september 16 2013 to stockholders of record at the close of business on august 30 2013 

  

pension and postretirement plan funding 

  

several factors influence the annual funding requirements for our pension plans for the us qualified plan our funding policy consists of annual contributions at a rate that provides for future plan benefits and maintains appropriate funded percentages such contribution is not less than the minimum required by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended “erisa” and subsequent pension legislation and is not more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes for each international plan our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations in addition amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions as detailed in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies and estimates ” the effect of our pension plan funding on future operating results will depend on economic conditions employee demographics mortality rates the number of participants electing to take lumpsum distributions investment performance and funding decisions 

  

 38  

  

for the us qualified plan we maintain an investment strategy of matching the duration of a substantial portion of the plan assets with the duration of the underlying plan liabilities this strategy assisted in maintaining a funded ratio of more than 100 as of june 30 2013 for fiscal 2013 and 2012 we met or exceeded all minimum contributions required by erisa for the us qualified plan for fiscal 2013 minimum contributions to the us qualified plan required by erisa were satisfied by using a portion of the credit balance credit balances occur when contributions to the plan exceed the minimum required by erisa in fiscal 2012 we made discretionary payments of 756 million to the us qualified plan and 94 million to our us postretirement medical plan as we continue to monitor the performance of our plan assets we may decide to make discretionary cash contributions to the us qualified plan or our postretirement plan in the united states during fiscal 2014 but do not have plans to do so at this time 

  

for fiscal 2013 and 2012 we made benefit payments under our nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan of 61 million and 66 million respectively we expect to make benefit payments under this plan during fiscal 2014 of approximately 121 million for fiscal 2013 and 2012 we made cash contributions to our international defined benefit pension plans of 259 million and 297 million respectively we expect to make contributions under these plans during fiscal 2014 of approximately 292 million 

  

commitments and contingencies 

  

certain of our business acquisition agreements include “earnout” provisions these provisions generally require that we pay to the seller or sellers of the business additional amounts based on the performance of the acquired business since the size of each payment depends upon performance of the acquired business we do not expect that such payments will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or financial condition 

  

for additional contingencies refer to “item 3 legal proceedings” 

  

contractual obligations 

  

the following table summarizes scheduled maturities of our contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed and determinable as of june 30 2013 

  

   

1   includes longterm and current debt and the related projected interest costs and to a lesser extent capital lease commitments interest costs on longterm and current debt are projected to be 613 million in each of the years from fiscal 2014 through fiscal 2017 446 million in fiscal 2018 and 7733 million thereafter projected interest costs on variable rate instruments were calculated using market rates at june 30 2013 refer to “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 9 – debt ” 

2   minimum operating lease commitments only include base rent certain leases provide for contingent rents that are not measurable at inception and primarily include rents based on a percentage of sales in excess of stipulated levels as well as common area maintenance these amounts are excluded from minimum operating lease commitments and are included in the determination of total rent expense when it is probable that the expense has been incurred and the amount is reasonably measurable 

3   unconditional purchase obligations primarily include inventory commitments estimated future earnout payments estimated royalty payments pursuant to license agreements advertising commitments capital improvement commitments planned funding of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations commitments pursuant to executive compensation arrangements obligations related to our cost savings initiatives and acquisitions future earnout payments and future royalty and advertising commitments were estimated based on planned future sales for the term that was in effect at june 30 2013 without consideration for potential renewal periods 

4 refer to “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 7 – income taxes” for information regarding unrecognized tax benefits as of june 30 2013 the noncurrent portion of our unrecognized tax benefits including related accrued interest and penalties was 805 million at this time the settlement period for the noncurrent portion of the unrecognized tax benefits including related accrued interest and penalties cannot be determined and therefore was not included

derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 

  

we address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments we enter into foreign currency forward contracts we may enter into option contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates and interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on our aggregate liability portfolio we also enter into foreign currency forward contracts and may use option contracts not designated as hedging instruments to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes costs associated with entering into these derivative financial instruments have not been material to our consolidated financial results 

  

for each derivative contract entered into where we look to obtain hedge accounting treatment we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items as well as our riskmanagement objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction the nature of the risk being hedged how the hedging instruments’ effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively and a description of the method of measuring ineffectiveness this process includes linking all derivatives to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions we also formally assess both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items if it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge we will be required to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively 

  

foreign exchange risk management 

  

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge anticipated transactions as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies for periods consistent with our identified exposures the purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on costs and on the cash flows that we receive from foreign subsidiaries the majority of foreign currency forward contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries we may also enter into foreign currency option contracts to hedge anticipated transactions where there is a high probability that anticipated exposures will materialize the foreign currency forward contracts entered into to hedge anticipated transactions have been designated as foreign currency cashflow hedges and have varying maturities through the end of march 2015 hedge effectiveness of foreign currency forward contracts is based on a hypothetical derivative methodology and excludes the portion of fair value attributable to the spotforward difference which is recorded in currentperiod earnings hedge effectiveness of foreign currency option contracts is based on a dollar offset methodology the ineffective portion of both foreign currency forward and option contracts is recorded in currentperiod earnings for hedge contracts that are no longer deemed highly effective hedge accounting is discontinued and gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income loss are reclassified to earnings when the underlying forecasted transaction occurs if it is probable that the forecasted transaction will no longer occur then any gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income loss are reclassified to currentperiod earnings as of june 30 2013 these foreign currency cashflow hedges were highly effective in all material respects 

  

at june 30 2013 we had foreign currency forward contracts in the amount of 15796 million the foreign currencies included in foreign currency forward contracts notional value stated in us dollars are principally the british pound 4262 million euro 2688 million canadian dollar 1986 million swiss franc 1115 million australian dollar 921 million thailand baht 755 million and hong kong dollar 581 million 

  

credit risk 

  

as a matter of policy we only enter into derivative contracts with counterparties that have a longterm credit rating of at least a or higher by at least two nationally recognized rating agencies the counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions exposure to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to the gross fair value of contracts in asset positions which totaled 217 million at june 30 2013 to manage this risk we have established counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored accordingly management believes risk of loss under these hedging contracts is remote 

  

certain of our derivative financial instruments contain creditriskrelated contingent features at june 30 2013 we were in a net asset position for certain derivative contracts that contain such features with two counterparties the fair value of those contracts as of june 30 2013 was approximately 46 million as of june 30 2013 we were in compliance with such creditriskrelated contingent features 

  

 40  

  

market risk 

  

we use a valueatrisk model to assess the market risk of our derivative financial instruments valueatrisk represents the potential losses for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors for a specified time period and confidence level we estimate valueatrisk across all of our derivative financial instruments using a model with historical volatilities and correlations calculated over the past 250day period the high low and average measured valueatrisk during fiscal 2013 related to our foreign exchange contracts is as follows 

  

   

the model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 percent confidence level we used a statistical simulation model that valued our derivative financial instruments against one thousand randomly generated market price paths our calculated valueatrisk exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may or may not occur it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated based upon actual fluctuations in market rates operating exposures and the timing thereof and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year we believe however that any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the derivative financial instrument was intended

the principal raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are essential oils alcohols and specialty chemicals we also purchase packaging components that are manufactured to our design specifications procurement of materials for all manufacturing facilities is generally made on a global basis through our global supplier relations department we are making a concentrated effort in supplier rationalization with the specific objective of reducing costs increasing innovation and speed to market and improving quality in addition we continue to focus on supply sourcing within the region of manufacture to allow for improved supply chain efficiencies as a result of sourcing initiatives there is increased dependency on certain suppliers but we believe that our portfolio of these suppliers has adequate resources and facilities to overcome most unforeseen interruptions of supply in the past we have been able to obtain an adequate supply of essential raw materials and currently believe we have adequate sources of supply for virtually all components of our products 

  

we are continually benchmarking the performance of the supply chain and will change suppliers and adjust our distribution networks and manufacturing footprint based upon the changing needs of the business as we integrate acquired brands we continually seek new ways to leverage our production and sourcing capabilities to improve our overall supply chain performance

 item 1a risk factors 

  

there are risks associated with an investment in our securities 

  

please consider the following risks and all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k and in our subsequent filings with the securities and exchange commission “sec” our business may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial if any of the events contemplated by the following discussion of risks should occur or other risks arise or develop our business prospects financial condition and results of operations as well as the trading prices of our securities may be adversely affected 

  

the beauty business is highly competitive and if we are unable to compete effectively our results will suffer 

  

we face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world including multinational consumer product companies some of these competitors have greater resources than we do and may be able to respond to changing business and economic conditions more quickly than us competition in the beauty business is based on pricing of products innovation perceived value service to the consumer promotional activities advertising special events new product introductions ecommerce and mcommerce initiatives and other activities it is difficult for us to predict the timing and scale of our competitors’ actions in these areas also the consolidation in the retail trade has resulted in us becoming increasingly dependent on key retailers including largeformat retailers who have increased their negotiating strength this trend has also resulted in an increased risk related to the concentration of our customers a severe adverse impact on their business operations could have a corresponding material adverse effect on us our ability to compete also depends on the continued strength of our brands our ability to attract and retain key talent and other personnel the efficiency of our manufacturing facilities and distribution network and our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property and those other rights used in our business our inability to continue to compete effectively in key countries around the world could have an adverse impact on our business in addition certain of our key retailers around the world market and sell competing brands or are owned or otherwise affiliated with companies that market and sell competing brands 

  

our inability to anticipate and respond to market trends and changes in consumer preferences could adversely affect our financial results 

  

our continued success depends on our ability to anticipate gauge and react in a timely and costeffective manner to changes in consumer tastes for skin care makeup fragrance and hair care products attitudes toward our industry and brands as well as to where and how consumers shop for those products we must continually work to develop manufacture and market new products maintain and adapt our “hightouch” services to existing and emerging distribution channels maintain and enhance the recognition of our brands achieve a favorable mix of products and refine our approach as to how and where we market and sell our products while we devote considerable effort and resources to shape analyze and respond to consumer preferences we recognize that consumer tastes cannot be predicted with certainty and can change rapidly the issue is compounded by the increasing use of social and digital media by consumers and the speed by which information and opinions are shared if we are unable to anticipate and respond to sudden challenges that we may face in the marketplace trends in the market for our products and changing consumer demands and sentiment our financial results will suffer 

  

 11  

  

our future success depends on our ability to achieve our longterm strategy 

  

achieving our longterm strategy will require investment in new capabilities brands categories distribution channels technologies and geographic markets these investments may result in shortterm costs without any current revenues and therefore may be dilutive to our earnings at least in the short term in addition we may dispose of or discontinue select brands or streamline operations and incur costs or restructuring and other charges in doing so although we believe that our strategy will lead to longterm growth in revenue and profitability we may not realize in full or in part the anticipated benefits the failure to realize benefits which may be due to our inability to execute plans global or local economic conditions competition changes in the beauty industry and the other risks described herein could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

acquisitions may expose us to additional risks 

  

we continuously review acquisition opportunities that would expand our current product offerings our distribution channels increase the size and geographic scope of our operations or otherwise offer growth and operating efficiency opportunities if required the financing for any of these acquisitions could result in an increase in our indebtedness dilute the interests of our stockholders or both acquisitions entail numerous risks which may include 

  

·   difficulties in assimilating acquired operations or products including the loss of key employees from or customers of acquired businesses 

·   diversion of management’s attention from our core businesses 

·   adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and 

·   risks of entering distribution channels categories or markets in which we have limited or no prior experience 

  

our failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate acquisitions on favorable terms 

  

completed acquisitions typically result in additional goodwill andor an increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet we are required at least annually or as facts and circumstances exist to test goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to determine if impairment has occurred if the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the fair value of other intangible assets with indefinite lives in the period the determination is made we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

a general economic downturn or sudden disruption in business conditions may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items andor the financial strength of our customers that are retailers which could adversely affect our financial results 

  

the general level of consumer spending is affected by a number of factors including general economic conditions inflation interest rates energy costs and consumer confidence generally all of which are beyond our control consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower and may impact sales of our products a decline in consumer purchases of discretionary items also tends to impact our customers that are retailers we generally extend credit to a retailer based on an evaluation of its financial condition usually without requiring collateral however the financial difficulties of a retailer could cause us to curtail or eliminate business with that customer we may also assume more credit risk relating to the receivables from that retailer our inability to collect the receivable from one of our largest customers or from a group of customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition if a retailer was to liquidate we may incur additional costs if we choose to purchase the retailer’s inventory of our products to protect brand equity 

  

in addition sudden disruptions in business conditions for example as a consequence of events such as a pandemic or local or international conflicts around the world or as a result of a terrorist attack retaliation and the threat of further attacks or retaliation or as a result of adverse weather conditions or climate changes or seismic events can have a short and sometimes longterm impact on consumer spending 

  

events that impact consumers’ willingness or ability to travel andor purchase our products while traveling may impact our travel retail business which is a significant contributor to our overall results 

  

 12  

  

a downturn or continuing recession in the economies in which we sell our products or a sudden disruption of business conditions in those economies could adversely affect consumer confidence the financial strength of our retailers and our sales and profitability we continue to see increased weakness due to global economic uncertainties and volatility in financial markets particularly in certain western european countries korea and australia we are also cautious that macroeconomic factors may temper the future growth trend of the chinese economy 

  

volatility in the financial markets and a related economic downturn in key markets or markets generally throughout the world could have a material adverse effect on our business while we currently generate significant cash flows from our ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities credit markets may experience significant disruptions deterioration in global financial markets could make future financing difficult or more expensive if any financial institutions that are parties to our undrawn revolving credit facility supporting our commercial paper program or other financing arrangements such as interest rate or foreign exchange hedging instruments were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us this could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain interest rate or foreign currency exposures which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

changes in laws regulations and policies that affect our business could adversely affect our financial results 

  

our business is subject to numerous laws regulations and policies changes in the laws regulations and policies including the interpretation or enforcement thereof that affect or will affect our business including changes in accounting standards tax laws and regulations laws and regulations relating to data privacy and anticorruption laws in europe relating to selective distribution environmental or climate change laws regulations or accords trade rules and customs regulations and the outcome and expense of legal or regulatory proceedings and any action we may take as a result could adversely affect our financial results 

  

we are involved and may become involved in the future in disputes and other legal or regulatory proceedings that if adversely decided or settled could adversely affect our financial results 

  

we are and may in the future become party to litigation other disputes or regulatory proceedings in general claims made by us or against us in litigation disputes or other proceedings can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements injunctions or damages that could significantly affect our business or financial results we are currently vigorously contesting certain of these claims however it is not possible to predict the final resolution of the litigation disputes or proceedings to which we currently are or may in the future become party to and the impact of certain of these matters on our business results of operations and financial condition could be material 

  

government reviews inquiries investigations and actions could harm our business or reputation 

  

as we operate in various locations around the world our operations in certain countries are subject to significant governmental scrutiny and may be adversely impacted by the results of such scrutiny the regulatory environment with regard to our business is evolving and officials often exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply applicable regulations from time to time we may receive formal and informal inquiries from various government regulatory authorities about our business and compliance with local laws and regulations any determination that our operations or activities or the activities of our employees are not in compliance with existing laws or regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines interruptions of business loss of supplier vendor or other thirdparty relationships termination of necessary licenses and permits or similar results all of which could potentially harm our business andor reputation even if an inquiry does not result in these types of determinations it potentially could create negative publicity which could harm our business andor reputation 

  

our success depends in part on the quality and safety of our products 

  

our success depends in part on the quality and safety of our products if our products are found to be defective or unsafe or if they otherwise fail to meet our consumers’ standards our relationships with customers or consumers could suffer the appeal of one or more of our brands could be diminished and we could lose sales andor become subject to liability claims any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

our success depends in part on our key personnel 

  

our success depends in part on our ability to retain our key personnel including our executive officers and senior management team the unexpected loss of one or more of our key employees could adversely affect our business our success also depends in part on our continuing ability to identify hire train and retain other highly qualified personnel competition for these employees can be intense we may not be able to attract assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business this risk may be exacerbated by the stresses associated with the implementation of our strategic plan and other initiatives 

  

 13  

  

we are subject to risks related to our foreign operations 

  

we operate on a global basis with a majority of our fiscal 2012 net sales and operating income generated outside the united states 

  

we intend to reinvest these earnings in our foreign operations indefinitely except where we are able to repatriate these earnings to the united states without material incremental tax provision a portion of our cash and cash equivalents that result from these earnings remain outside the united states if these indefinitely reinvested earnings were repatriated into the united states as dividends we would be subject to additional taxes 

  

we maintain offices in over 40 countries and have key operational facilities located outside the united states that manufacture warehouse or distribute goods for sale throughout the world foreign operations are subject to many risks and uncertainties including 

  

· fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which can affect our results of operations the value of our foreign assets the relative prices at which we and foreign competitors sell products in the same markets and the cost of certain inventory and noninventory items required in our operations 

  

· changes in foreign laws regulations and policies including restrictions on trade import and export license requirements and tariffs and taxes as well as changes in united states laws and regulations relating to foreign trade and investment and 

  

· adverse weather conditions currency exchange controls and social economic and geopolitical conditions such as terrorist attacks war or other military action 

  

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects results of operations and financial condition 

  

a disruption in operations or our supply chain could adversely affect our business and financial results 

  

as a company engaged in manufacturing and distribution on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including industrial accidents environmental events strikes and other labor disputes disruptions in supply chain or information systems loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites product quality control safety increase in commodity prices and energy costs licensing requirements and other regulatory issues as well as natural disasters and other external factors over which we have no control if such an event were to occur it could have an adverse affect on our business and financial results 

  

our information systems and websites may be susceptible to outages hacking and other risks 

  

we have information systems that support our business processes including product development marketing sales order processing production distribution finance and intracompany communications throughout the world we have ecommerce mcommerce and other internet websites in the united states and many other countries these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire floods power loss telecommunications failures breakins and similar events despite the implementation of network security measures our systems may be vulnerable to computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering the occurrence of these or other events could disrupt or damage our information systems and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

we are subject to risks associated with implementing global information systems 

  

as part of smi we are implementing enterprisewide global programs intended to deliver a single set of integrated data processes and technologies which would be scalable and used to standardize business processes across brands regions and functions we anticipate the continued migration of our operations to sap with the majority of our locations to be enabled through 2014 like most entitywide changes to software systems the implementation of smi involves risks and uncertainties failure to implement smi as planned in terms of timing specifications andor costs could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

  

the trading prices of our securities periodically may rise or fall based on the accuracy of predictions of our earnings or other financial performance 

  

our business planning process is designed to maximize our longterm strength growth and profitability not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter we believe that this longerterm focus is in the best interests of the company and our stockholders at the same time however we recognize that it may be helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our forecast of net sales earnings per share and other financial metrics or projections accordingly when we announced our yearend financial results for fiscal 2012 we provided guidance as to a number of assumptions including our expected net sales and earnings per share for the fiscal year ending june 30 2013 and the quarter ending september 30 2012 while we generally expect to provide updates to our guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter we assume no responsibility to update any of our forwardlooking statements at such times or otherwise in addition the longerterm guidance we provide is based on goals that we believe at the time guidance is given are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years such targets are more difficult to predict than our current quarter and fiscal year expectations

in all of our public statements when we make or update a forwardlooking statement about our net sales andor earnings expectations or expectations regarding restructuring or other initiatives we accompany such statements directly or by reference to a public document with a list of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we expect such a list is included among other places in our earnings press release and in our periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission eg in our reports on form 10k and form 10q these and other factors may make it difficult for us and for outside observers such as research analysts to predict what our earnings will be in any given fiscal quarter or year 

  

outside analysts and investors have the right to make their own predictions of our financial results for any future period outside analysts however have access to no more material information about our results or plans than any other public investor and we do not endorse their predictions as to our future performance nor do we assume any responsibility to correct the predictions of outside analysts or others when they differ from our own internal expectations if and when we announce actual results that differ from those that outside analysts or others have been predicting the market price of our securities could be affected investors who rely on the predictions of outside analysts or others when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk we take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in the prices of our securities 

  

failure to adequately maintain the security of our electronic and other confidential information could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

  

we are dependent upon automated information technology processes as part of our normal business activities we collect and store certain confidential information including personal information with respect to customers and employees we may share some of this information with vendors who assist us with certain aspects of our business moreover the success of our ecommerce and mcommerce operations depends upon the secure transmission of confidential and personal data over public networks including the use of cashless payments any failure on the part of us or our vendors to maintain the security of our confidential data and our employees’ and customers’ personal information including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information could result in business disruption damage to our reputation financial obligations to third parties fines penalties regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs and also result in deterioration in our employees’ and customers’ confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages and thus could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to enhance our information security systems and could result in a disruption to our operations 

  

as we outsource more functions we will become more dependent on the entities performing those functions 

  

as part of our longterm strategy we are continually looking for opportunities to provide essential business services in a more costeffective manner in some cases this requires the outsourcing of functions or parts of functions that can be performed more effectively by external service providers these include certain information systems functions such as information technology operations and certain human resource functions such as employee benefit plan administration while we believe we conduct appropriate due diligence before entering into agreements with the outsourcing entity the failure of one or more entities to provide the expected services provide them on a timely basis or to provide them at the prices we expect may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

  

we are controlled by the lauder family as a result of their control of us the lauder family has the ability to prevent or cause a change in control or approve prevent or influence certain actions by us 

  

as of august 13 2012 members of the lauder family beneficially own directly or indirectly shares of the company’s class a common stock with one vote per share and class b common stock with 10 votes per share having 869 of the outstanding voting power of the common stock in addition there are four members of the lauder family who are employees including three who are members of our board of directors another family member is on our board and is a party to a consulting agreement and a license agreement with us as a result of the stock ownership and their positions at the company the lauder family has the ability to exercise significant control and influence over our business including without limitation all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors amendments to the certificate of incorporation and significant corporate transactions such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets for the foreseeable future 

  

 15  

  

we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the new york stock exchange rules and as a result are relying on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that are designed to provide protection to stockholders of companies that are not “controlled companies” 

  

the lauder family and their related entities own more than 50 of the total voting power of our common shares and as a result we are a “controlled company” under the new york stock exchange corporate governance standards as a controlled company we are exempt under the new york stock exchange standards from the obligation to comply with certain new york stock exchange corporate governance requirements including the requirements 

·   that a majority of our board of directors consists of independent directors 

·   that we have a nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities and 

·   that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities 

while we have voluntarily caused our board to have a majority of independent directors and the written charters of our nominating and board affairs committee and the compensation committee to have the required provisions we are not requiring our nominating and board affairs committee and compensation committee to be comprised solely of independent directors as a result of our use of the “controlled company” exemptions investors will not have the same protection afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the new york stock exchange corporate governance requirements

 item 3 legal proceedings  

  

we are involved from time to time in litigation and other legal proceedings incidental to our business management believes that the outcome of current litigation and legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial condition however management’s assessment of our current litigation and other legal proceedings could change in light of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions or other proceedings pending against us not presently known to us or determinations by judges juries or other finders of fact which are not in accord with management’s evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such litigation or proceedings except as disclosed below reasonably possible losses in addition to the amounts accrued for litigation and other legal proceedings are not material to our consolidated financial statements

during the fiscal 2007 fourth quarter the former owner of the darphin brand initiated litigation in the paris commercial court against us seeking to recover €600 million 755 million at the exchange rate at june 30 2012 that he claims he was owed as additional consideration for the sale of darphin to us in april 2003 on december 23 2011 the paris commercial court issued its judgment awarding the former owner €229 million 288 million at the exchange rate at june 30 2012 plus interest from 2007 we have filed our appeal with the paris court of appeal in accordance with the judgment in january 2012 we paid €253 million 318 million at the exchange rate at june 30 2012 to the former owner and received from him a bank guarantee to assure repayment to us of such sum or any part thereof in the event that the judgment is reversed by the paris court of appeal based upon our assessment of the case as well as the advice of external counsel we are maintaining the amount we previously accrued as an amount that we believe will ultimately be paid based on the probable outcome of the appeal such amount is less than the paris commercial court’s award

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition at june 30 2012 and our results of operations for the three fiscal years ended june 30 2012 are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements these estimates and assumptions can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition inventory pension and other postretirement benefit costs goodwill other intangible assets and longlived assets income taxes and derivatives 

  

management of the company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of the company’s board of directors 

  

revenue recognition 

revenues from product sales are recognized upon transfer of ownership including passage of title to the customer and transfer of the risk of loss related to those goods in the americas region sales are generally recognized at the time the product is shipped to the customer and in the europe the middle east  africa and asiapacific regions sales are generally recognized based upon the customer’s receipt in certain circumstances transfer of title takes place at the point of sale for example at our retail stores 

  

revenues are reported on a net sales basis which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual product returns received discounts incentive arrangements with retailers and an amount established for anticipated product returns our practice is to accept product returns from retailers only if properly requested authorized and approved in accepting returns we typically provide a credit to the retailer against accounts receivable from that retailer as a percentage of gross sales returns were 35 in fiscal 2012 and 2011 and 43 in fiscal 2010 the improvement from fiscal 2010 reflects efforts to work with our customers to improve their forecasting and product mix to better address their inventory requirements 

  

our sales return accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net sales this accrual is calculated based on a history of actual returns estimated future returns and information provided by retailers regarding their inventory levels consideration of these factors results in an accrual for anticipated sales returns that reflects increases or decreases related to seasonal fluctuations experience has shown a relationship between retailer inventory levels and sales returns in the subsequent period as well as a consistent pattern of returns due to the seasonal nature of our business in addition as necessary specific accruals may be established for significant future known or anticipated events the types of known or anticipated events that we have considered and will continue to consider include but are not limited to the financial condition of our customers store closings by retailers changes in the retail environment and our decision to continue to support new and existing products 

  

in the ordinary course of business we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions based upon the evaluation of accounts receivable aging specific exposures and historical trends our allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net earnings the allowance for doubtful accounts was 311 million and 339 million as of june 30 2012 and 2011 respectively the allowance for doubtful accounts was reduced by 138 million 99 million and 158 million for customer deductions and writeoffs in fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively and increased by 110 million 95 million and 87 million for additional provisions in fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

  

inventory 

we state our inventory at the lower of cost or fairmarket value with cost being based on standard cost which approximates actual cost on the firstin firstout fifo method we believe this method most closely matches the flow of our products from manufacture through sale the reported net value of our inventory includes saleable products promotional products raw materials and componentry and work in process that will be sold or used in future periods inventory cost includes raw materials direct labor and overhead as well as inbound freight manufacturing overhead is allocated to the cost of inventory based on the normal production capacity unallocated overhead during periods of abnormally low production levels are recognized as cost of sales in the period in which they are incurred 

  

we also record an inventory obsolescence reserve which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated realizable value based on various product sales projections this reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales in addition and as necessary we may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events 

  

 21  

  

pension and other postretirement benefit costs 

we offer the following benefits to some or all of our employees a domestic trustbased noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan “us qualified plan” and an unfunded nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations collectively with the us qualified plan the “domestic plans” a domestic contributory defined contribution plan international pension plans which vary by country consisting of both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans deferred compensation arrangements and certain other postretirement benefit plans 

  

the amounts needed to fund future payouts under these plans are subject to numerous assumptions and variables certain significant variables require us to make assumptions that are within our control such as an anticipated discount rate expected rate of return on plan assets and future compensation levels we evaluate these assumptions with our actuarial advisors and select assumptions that we believe reflect the economics underlying our pension and postretirement obligations while we believe these assumptions are within accepted industry ranges an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a direct impact on reported net earnings 

  

the discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated longterm bonds for fiscal 2012 we used a discount rate for our domestic plans of 540 and varying rates on our international plans of between 125 and 825 the discount rate for our domestic plans is based on a bond portfolio that includes only longterm bonds with an aa rating or equivalent from a major rating agency we believe the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio is expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of our domestic plans for fiscal 2012 we used an expected return on plan assets of 775 for our us qualified plan and varying rates of between 200 and 825 for our international plans in determining the longterm rate of return for a plan we consider the historical rates of return the nature of the plan’s investments and an expectation for the plan’s investment strategies see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 13 – pension deferred compensation and postretirement benefit plans ” for details regarding the nature of our pension and postretirement plan investments the difference between actual and expected return on plan assets is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income those gainslosses that are subject to amortization over future periods will be recognized as a component of the net periodic benefit cost in such future periods for fiscal 2012 our pension plans had actual return on assets of approximately 76 million as compared with expected return on assets of approximately 60 million which resulted in a net deferred gain of approximately 16 million substantially all of which is currently subject to be amortized over periods ranging from approximately 6 to 22 years the actual return on plan assets was primarily related to the strong performance of the fixed income investments during the past fiscal year 

  

a 25 basispoint change in the discount rate or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have had the following effect on fiscal 2012 pension expense 

  

   

our postretirement plans are comprised of health care plans that could be impacted by health care cost trend rates which may have a significant effect on the amounts reported a onepercentagepoint change in assumed health care cost trend rates for fiscal 2012 would have had the following effects 

  

   

for fiscal 2013 we are using a discount rate for the domestic plans of 390 and varying rates for our international plans of between 100 and 700 we are using an expected return on plan assets of 750 for the us qualified plan and varying rates for our international pension plans of between 225 and 700 the net change in these assumptions from those used in fiscal 2012 will result in an increase in pension expense of approximately 19 million in fiscal 2013 we will continue to monitor the market conditions relative to these assumptions and adjust them accordingly 

  

goodwill other intangible assets and longlived assets 

goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets other indefinitelived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized 

  

 22  

  

we assess goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles at least annually for impairment as of the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which is one level below our operating segments we identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and management of each reporting unit regularly reviews the operating results of those components we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to determine carrying values for our reporting units impairment testing is performed in two steps i we determine if an indication of impairment exists by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value and ii if there is an impairment we measure the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill the impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets encompasses calculating a fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value if the carrying value exceeds the fair value an impairment charge is recorded 

  

testing goodwill for impairment requires us to estimate fair values of reporting units using significant estimates and assumptions the assumptions made will impact the outcome and ultimate results of the testing we use industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and in certain instances we engage thirdparty valuation specialists for advice to determine fair value of the reporting unit we generally use an equal weighting of the income and market approaches in certain circumstances equal weighting will not be applied if one of these methods may be less applicable eg only the income approach would be used for reporting units with existing negative margins we believe both approaches are equally relevant and the most reliable indications of fair value because the fair value of product or service companies is more dependent on the ability to generate earnings than on the value of the assets used in the production process 

  

under the income approach we determine fair value using a discounted cash flow method projecting future cash flows of each reporting unit as well as a terminal value and discounting such cash flows at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows under the market approach we utilize information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units which creates valuation multiples that are applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested to value the reporting unit 

  

the key estimates and factors used in these two approaches include but are not limited to revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts terminal value the weightedaverage cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and comparable market multiples the fiscal 2012 compound annual growth rate of sales for the first five to eight years of our projections as considered appropriate for the individual reporting units ranged between 5 and 18 with the higher growth rates in those reporting units that start with the smallest base in fiscal 2012 the fiscal 2011 compound annual growth rate of sales for the first five to eight years of our projections ranged between 3 and 19 with the higher growth rates in those reporting units that start with the smallest base in fiscal 2011 for reporting units with positive earnings growth in the corresponding earnings before interest and taxes ranged from 7 to 47 in fiscal 2012 as compared with 6 to 109 in fiscal 2011 the terminal growth rates were projected at 3 after five to eight years in fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 which reflects our estimate of long term market and gross domestic product growth the weightedaverage cost of capital used to discount future cash flows ranged from 8 to 16 in fiscal 2012 as compared with 75 to 16 in fiscal 2011 the range of market multiples used in our fiscal 2012 impairment testing was from 17 to 33 times trailingtwelvemonth sales and 100 to 125 times trailingtwelvemonth earnings before interest taxes and depreciation and amortization the range of market multiples used in our fiscal 2011 impairment testing was from 15 to 3 times trailingtwelvemonth sales and between 11 to 12 times trailingtwelvemonth earnings before interest taxes and depreciation and amortization future changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the results of our reviews for impairment of goodwill however a decrease of 100 basis points in our terminal growth rate or an increase of 100 basis points in our weightedaverage cost of capital would still result in a fair value calculation exceeding our book value for each of our reporting units except for the darphin reporting unit for which a decrease of 75 basis points in our terminal growth rate would still result in a fair value calculation exceeding its book value changes in the valuation assumptions from those used in the prior year primarily reflect the impact of the current economic environment on the reporting units and their projected future results of operations 

  

to determine fair value of other indefinitelived intangible assets we use an income approach the relieffromroyalty method this method assumes that in lieu of ownership a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to obtain the rights to use the comparable asset other indefinitelived intangible assets’ fair values require significant judgments in determining both the assets’ estimated cash flows as well as the appropriate discount and royalty rates applied to those cash flows to determine fair value changes in such estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results the fiscal 2012 and 2011 terminal growth rate applied to future cash flows was 3 and the fiscal 2012 and 2011 discount rates ranged from 10 to 18 the fiscal 2012 and 2011 royalty rates ranged from 05 to 12 

  

we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable when such events or changes in circumstances occur a recoverability test is performed comparing projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset or asset group to its carrying value if the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value an impairment would be recorded for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value which is determined by discounting future cash flows 

  

 23  

  

income taxes 

we account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns as of june 30 2012 we have current net deferred tax assets of 2478 million and noncurrent net deferred tax assets of 1031 million the net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization as well as the continued application of currently anticipated tax rates included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance of 732 million for deferred tax assets where management believes it is morelikelythannot that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the relevant jurisdiction based on our assessments no additional valuation allowance is required if we determine that a deferred tax asset will not be realizable an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will result in a reduction of net earnings at that time 

  

we provide tax reserves for us federal state local and foreign exposures relating to periods subject to audit the development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues potential outcomes and timing and is a subjective critical estimate we assess our tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting dates for those tax positions where it is morelikelythannot that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those tax positions where it is not morelikelythannot that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements we classify applicable interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes although the outcome relating to these exposures is uncertain in management’s opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating from these exposures if actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates they could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations 

  

derivatives 

we address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and may enter into option contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates and interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on our aggregate liability portfolio we also enter into foreign currency forward contracts and may use option contracts not designated as hedging instruments to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes hedge effectiveness is documented assessed and monitored by employees who are qualified to make such assessments and monitor the instruments variables that are external to us such as social political and economic risks may have an impact on our hedging program and the results thereof 

  

our derivative financial instruments are recorded as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measured at fair value all derivatives outstanding as of june 30 2012 are i designated as a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment “fairvalue” hedge ii designated as a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability “foreign currency cashflow” hedge or iii not designated as a hedging instrument changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a fairvalue hedge that is highly effective are recorded in currentperiod earnings along with the loss or gain on the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk including losses or gains on unrecognized firm commitments changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a foreign currency cashflow hedge of a foreigncurrencydenominated forecasted transaction that is highly effective are recorded in other comprehensive income loss “oci” gains and losses deferred in oci are then recognized in currentperiod earnings when earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged foreigncurrencydenominated forecasted transaction eg when periodic settlements on a variablerate asset or liability are recorded in earnings changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are reported in currentperiod earnings 

  

for a discussion on the quantitative impact of market risks related to our derivative financial instruments see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity and capital resources – market risk” 

  

quantitative analysis 

during the threeyear period ended june 30 2012 there have not been material changes in the assumptions underlying these critical accounting policies nor to the related significant estimates the results of our business underlying these assumptions have not differed significantly from our expectations 

  

while we believe that the estimates that we have made are proper and the related results of operations for the period are presented fairly in all material respects other assumptions could reasonably be justified that would change the amount of reported net sales cost of sales operating expenses or our provision for income taxes as they relate to the provisions for anticipated sales returns allowance for doubtful accounts inventory obsolescence reserve and income taxes for fiscal 2012 had these estimates been changed simultaneously by 25 in either direction our reported gross profit would have increased or decreased by approximately 48 million operating expenses would have changed by approximately 08 million and the provision for income taxes would have remained unchanged the collective impact of these changes on operating income net earnings attributable to the estée lauder companies inc and net earnings attributable to the estée lauder companies inc per diluted common share would be an increase or decrease of approximately 56 million 56 million and 01 respectively

results of operations 

we manufacture market and sell beauty products including those in the skin care makeup fragrance and hair care categories which are distributed in over 150 countries and territories the following table is a comparative summary of operating results from continuing operations for fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 and reflects the basis of presentation described in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 2 – summary of significant accounting policies and note 20 – segment data and related information ” for all periods presented products and services that do not meet our definition of skin care makeup fragrance and hair care have been included in the “other” category 

  

   

 25  

  

the following table presents certain consolidated earnings data as a percentage of net sales 

  

   

in order to meet the demands of consumers we continually introduce new products support new and established products through advertising merchandising and sampling and phase out existing products that no longer meet the needs of our consumers the economics of developing producing launching supporting and discontinuing products impact our sales and operating performance each period the introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products which we take into account in our business planning 

  

we operate on a global basis with the majority of our net sales generated outside the united states accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our results of operations therefore we present certain net sales information excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations to provide a framework for assessing the performance of our underlying business outside the united states constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant periodoverperiod we calculate constant currency information by translating current year results using prior year weightedaverage foreign currency exchange rates 

  

overview 

we believe that the best way to continue to increase stockholder value is to provide our customers and consumers with the products and services that they have come to expect from us in the most efficient and profitable manner while recognizing consumers’ changing shopping habits to be the global leader in prestige beauty we continued to implement a longterm strategy that is guiding us through fiscal 2015 the strategy has numerous initiatives across geographic regions product categories brands and functions that are designed to leverage our strengths make us more productive and grow our sales 

  

we believe we have a strong diverse brand portfolio with global reach and potential and we plan to continue building upon and leveraging our history of outstanding creativity innovation and entrepreneurship we have succeeded in expanding our “hightouch” service model and will continue to look for ways to expand it in newer channels and within geographic regions as an example we are developing capabilities to deliver superior retailing experiences particularly in companyoperated retail stores we are expanding our efforts to evolve our ecommercebased online strategy into a multipronged digital strategy encompassing ecommerce mcommerce as well as digital and social media we are leveraging our regional organization in an effort to assure that we are locally relevant with our products services marketing and visual merchandising

returns and charges associated with restructuring activities 

in an effort to drive down costs and achieve synergies within our organization in february 2009 we announced the implementation of a multifaceted cost savings program the “program” to position the company to achieve longterm profitable growth we anticipate the program will result in related restructuring and other charges inclusive of cumulative charges recorded to date and through the remainder of the program totaling between 350 million and 450 million before taxes while we will continue to seek cost savings opportunities our current plans are to identify and approve specific initiatives under the program through calendar 2012 and execute those initiatives through fiscal 2013 the total amount of charges pretax associated with the program recorded plus other initiatives approved through june 30 2012 is approximately 361 million to 366 million of which approximately 251 million to 253 million relates to restructuring charges approximately 50 million of other costs to implement the initiatives approximately 42 million to 45 million in sales returns and approximately 18 million in inventory writeoffs the restructuring charges are comprised of approximately 188 million to 190 million of employeerelated costs approximately 40 million of other exit costs and contract terminations substantially all of which have resulted in or will result in cash expenditures and approximately 23 million in noncash asset writeoffs the total amount of cumulative charges pretax associated with the program recorded from inception through june 30 2012 was 3026 million 

  

we expect that the implementation of this program combined with other ongoing cost savings efforts will result in savings of approximately 760 million to 785 million program inception through the end of fiscal 2012 is approximately 710 million including the reduction of certain costs relative to an assumed normalized spending pattern our longrange forecast for operating margin reflects these anticipated savings net of strategic reinvestments 

  

the program focuses on a redesign of our organizational structure in order to integrate the company in a more cohesive way and operate more globally across brands and functions the principal aspect of the program was the reduction of the workforce by approximately 2000 employees specific actions taken since program inception included 

  

·   resize and reorganize the organization — we continued the realignment and optimization of our organization to better leverage scale improve productivity reduce complexity and achieve cost savings in each region and across various functions this included reduction of the workforce which occurred through the consolidation of certain functions which we achieved through a combination of normal attrition and job eliminations and the closure and consolidation of certain distribution and office facilities 

  

·   turnaround or exit unprofitable operations — to improve the profitability in certain of our brands and regions we have selectively exited certain channels of distribution categories and markets and have made changes to turnaround others this included the exit from the global wholesale distribution of our prescriptives brand the reformulation of ojon brand products and the exit from the global distribution of sean john products in connection with these activities we incurred charges for product returns inventory writeoffs reduction of workforce and termination of contracts 

  

·   outsourcing — in order to balance the growing need for information technology support with our efforts to provide the most efficient and cost effective solutions we continued the outsourcing of certain information technology processes we incurred costs to transition services to outsource providers and employeerelated termination costs

goodwill and other intangible asset impairments 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2012 the ojon reporting unit identified a potential decline in its projected results of operations primarily resulting from a softness in the direct response television channel which caused us to review and revise ojon’s longterm forecast we concluded that these changes in the business of the ojon reporting unit triggered the need for an interim impairment test of its trademarks as of december 31 2011 these changes in circumstances were also an indicator that the carrying amount of the customer list may not be recoverable we performed an interim impairment test for the trademarks and a recoverability test for the customer list as of december 31 2011 for the trademarks we concluded that the carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value which was based on the use of a royalty rate to determine discounted projected future cash flows “relieffromroyalty method” as a result we recognized an impairment charge of 67 million this charge was reflected in the hair care product category and in the americas region we concluded that the carrying value of the customer list was recoverable 

  

as of our annual stepone goodwill impairment test on april 1 2012 all reporting units’ fair values substantially exceeded their respective carrying values and the fair values of all other indefinitelived intangible assets substantially exceeded their respective carrying values except as noted below we determined that the carrying value of the ojon brand trademark exceeded its estimated fair value which was based on the relieffromroyalty method as a result we recognized an impairment charge of 33 million for the remaining carrying value of the related trademark we also determined that the future cash flows associated with the ojon brand customer list were less than its carrying value as the remaining carrying value of the customer list is not recoverable we recognized an impairment charge of 117 million these impairment charges were reflected in the hair care product category and in the americas region 

  

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 the darphin reporting unit experienced an unanticipated deterioration in its results of operations due to softness in its european business which is its primary market based on a qualitative analysis we reviewed and revised darphin’s longterm forecast we concluded that these changes in circumstances triggered the need for an impairment test of the reporting unit’s trademark and goodwill as of june 30 2012 we determined that the trademark was not impaired with the estimated fair value exceeding the carrying value by less than 2 as of june 30 2012 the carrying value of the trademark was 79 million the estimated fair value of the trademark was based upon the relieffromroyalty method the key assumptions that were used to determine the estimated fair value of the trademark were based on the expectation that the economic uncertainties in europe would be temporary and not permanent in nature if the decline in this market is more severe than we have anticipated or other business disruptions arise a resulting change in the key assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of this trademark and it is possible we could recognize an impairment charge in the future after completing the interim impairment test on the trademark we completed step one of the impairment test for goodwill and concluded that the fair value of the darphin reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value including goodwill 

  

although our consolidated financial performance exceeded our expectations for fiscal 2012 we expect global economic conditions uncertainties and volatility to impact our business as the duration and magnitude of the volatility of the current economic conditions remain uncertain we will continue to monitor and evaluate the potential impact on our business and on our annual impairment testing accordingly it is possible that we would recognize an impairment charge in the future with respect to goodwill other intangible assets andor longlived assets

net sales 

net sales increased 10 or 9036 million to 97136 million reflecting growth in all of our major product categories within each geographic region the impact of foreign currency translation on net sales was de minimis 

  

the following discussions of net sales by product categories and geographic regions exclude the impact of returns associated with restructuring activities of 21 million and 46 million recorded during fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 respectively we believe the following analysis of net sales better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business in the fiscal 2012 third quarter we established a provision for thenanticipated returns of approximately 16 million as a result of repositioning certain products due to changes in regulations related to sunscreen products in the united states these regulations were subsequently deferred and accordingly we reversed this provision in the fiscal 2012 fourth quarter as the identified products are expected to be sold in the ordinary course of business we do not expect any significant financial impact due to these regulations

we strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market which may account for differences in regional sales growth 

  

cost of sales 

  

cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales decreased to 205 as compared with 220 in the prior year this improvement primarily reflected our efforts in connection with the program including strategic changes in the mix of our business and pricing of approximately 140 basis points favorable manufacturing variances of approximately 10 basis points and the favorable effect of exchange rates of approximately 10 basis points these improvements were partially offset by an increase in obsolescence charges of approximately 10 basis points 

  

since certain promotional activities are a component of sales or cost of sales and the timing and level of promotions vary with our promotional calendar we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in the cost of sales percentage in addition future cost of sales mix may be impacted by the inclusion of potential new brands or channels of distribution that have margin and product cost structures different from those of our current mix of business 

  

operating expenses 

  

operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 660 as compared with 656 in the prior year this change reflected increased spending in advertising merchandising and sampling costs in line with our strategy of approximately 80 basis points higher costs related to stockbased compensation of approximately 20 basis points an increase in general and administrative costs of approximately 10 basis points and higher charges associated with restructuring activities of approximately 10 basis points partially offsetting these changes were lower selling and shipping costs as a percentage of net sales of approximately 50 basis points lower charges associated with goodwill and other intangible asset impairments of approximately 20 basis points and a favorable change in foreign exchange transactions of approximately 10 basis points 

  

changes in advertising merchandising and sampling spending result from the type timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts as well as the markets being emphasized we anticipate higher investment spending on global advertising merchandising and sampling to support major launches and existing franchises for fiscal 2013

provision for income taxes 

  

the provision for income taxes represents us federal foreign state and local income taxes the effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state and local income taxes the taxation of foreign income and income tax reserve adjustments which represent changes in our net liability for unrecognized tax benefits including tax settlements and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations our effective tax rate will change from year to year based on recurring and nonrecurring factors including but not limited to the geographical mix of earnings enacted tax legislation state and local income taxes tax reserve adjustments the ultimate disposition of deferred tax assets relating to stockbased compensation and the interaction of various global tax strategies 

  

the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2012 was 318 as compared with 314 in the prior year the increase in the effective income tax rate of 40 basis points was principally due to a decrease in favorable tax reserve adjustments as compared with the prior year partially offset by a lower effective tax rate related to our foreign operations

geographic regions 

  

operating results in each of our geographic regions benefited from the initiatives we implemented as part of the program and a more strategically focused approach to spending as well as significant improvement in cost of sales from favorable product mix and enhanced inventory management resulting in significant improvements in their operating income 

  

operating income in the americas increased 52 or 834 million to 2449 million reflecting strong sales from our heritage and makeup artist brands partially offset by incremental spending in line with our strategy 

  

in europe the middle east  africa operating income increased 30 or 1511 million to 6519 million reflecting higher results from our travel retail business russia the united kingdom and the middle east of approximately 94 million combined partially offsetting these improvements were lower results in the balkans and spain of approximately 9 million combined the higher results also reflected a favorable comparison to fiscal 2010 which included a charge related to our longterm perfumery strategy as previously discussed of approximately 34 million 

  

in asiapacific operating income increased 19 or 397 million to 2520 million virtually all countries in the region reported higher operating results led by approximately 46 million in china hong kong taiwan and malaysia combined partially offsetting these increases were lower operating results of approximately 7 million in japan and australia 

  

interest expense net 

  

net interest expense was 639 million as compared with 743 million in fiscal 2010 interest expense decreased primarily due to a reduction of debt balances that resulted from the 200 million debt tender offer we completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 

  

interest expense on debt extinguishment 

  

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 we completed a cash tender offer for 1300 million principal amount of our 2012 senior notes at a price of 108500 of the principal amount and for 699 million principal amount of our 2013 senior notes at a tender price of 118813 of the principal amount we recorded a pretax expense on the extinguishment of debt of 273 million representing the tender premium of 242 million the prorata writeoff of 24 million of unamortized terminated interest rate swap issuance costs and debt discount and 07 million in tender offer costs associated with both series of notes 

  

provision for income taxes 

  

the provision for income taxes represents us federal foreign state and local income taxes the effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state and local income taxes the taxation of foreign income and income tax reserve adjustments which represent changes in our net liability for unrecognized tax benefits including tax settlements and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations our effective tax rate will change from year to year based on recurring and nonrecurring factors including but not limited to the geographical mix of earnings enacted tax legislation state and local income taxes tax reserve adjustments the ultimate disposition of deferred tax assets relating to stockbased compensation and the interaction of various global tax strategies 

  

the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2011 was 314 as compared with 299 in fiscal 2010 the increase in the effective income tax rate of 150 basis points was principally due to a decrease in favorable tax reserve adjustments as compared with fiscal 2010

financial condition 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

overview 

  

our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program borrowings from the issuance of longterm debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks and other lenders in the united states and abroad at june 30 2012 we had cash and cash equivalents of 13477 million compared with 12530 million at june 30 2011 our cash and cash equivalents are maintained at a number of financial institutions as of june 30 2012 approximately 17 of the total balance was insured by governmental agencies to mitigate the risk of uninsured balances we select financial institutions based on their credit ratings and financial strength and perform ongoing evaluations of these institutions to limit our concentration risk exposure 

  

our business is seasonal in nature and accordingly our working capital needs vary from time to time we may enter into investing and financing transactions that require additional funding to the extent that these needs exceed cash from operations we could subject to market conditions issue commercial paper issue longterm debt securities or borrow under our revolving credit facilities 

  

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that cash on hand cash generated from operations available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business operations information systems enhancements capital expenditures potential stock repurchases commitments and other contractual obligations on both a nearterm and longterm basis our cash and cash equivalents balance at june 30 2012 includes approximately 708 million of cash in offshore jurisdictions associated with our permanent reinvestment strategy we do not believe that the indefinite reinvestment of these funds offshore impairs our ability to meet our domestic debt or working capital obligations if these indefinitely reinvested earnings were repatriated into the united states as dividends we would be subject to additional taxes 

  

the effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years generally we have been able to introduce new products at higher prices increase prices and implement other operating efficiencies to sufficiently offset cost increases which have been moderate 

  

credit ratings 

  

changes in our credit ratings will likely result in changes in our borrowing costs our credit ratings also impact the cost of our revolving credit facility as discussed below downgrades in our credit ratings may reduce our ability to issue commercial paper andor longterm debt and would likely increase the relative costs of borrowing a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating as of august 13 2012 our commercial paper is rated a1 by standard  poor’s and p1 by moody’s and our longterm debt is rated a with a stable outlook by standard  poor’s and a2 with a stable outlook by moody’s

debt 

  

at june 30 2012 our outstanding borrowings were as follows 

  

 

   

in august 2012 we issued 2500 million of 235 senior notes due august 15 2022 “2022 senior notes” and 2500 million of 370 senior notes due august 15 2042 “2042 senior notes” in a public offering the 2022 senior notes were priced at 99911 with a yield of 2360 the 2042 senior notes were priced at 99567 with a yield of 3724 interest payments on both notes are required to be made semiannually on february 15 and august 15 commencing february 15 2013 on august 2 2012 we called for redemption all of the outstanding 2013 senior notes on september 4 2012 we intend to use approximately 250 million of the net proceeds of the offering for the redemption of which approximately 18 million to 20 million represents debt extinguishment costs and to use the remaining amounts for general corporate purposes 

  

we have a 7500 million commercial paper program under which we may issue commercial paper in the united states at june 30 2012 we had 2000 million of commercial paper outstanding which we may refinance on a periodic basis as it matures at thenprevailing market interest rates at august 13 2012 we had 2000 million of commercial paper outstanding we also have 1649 million in additional uncommitted credit facilities of which 71 million was used as of june 30 2012 we do not anticipate difficulties in securing this form of working capital financing 

  

we have a 10 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on july 14 2015 the “facility” the facility may be used to provide credit support for our commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes up to the equivalent of 250 million of the facility is available for multicurrency loans the interest rate on borrowings under the facility is based on libor or on the higher of prime which is the rate of interest publicly announced by the administrative agent or ½ plus the federal funds rate we incurred costs of approximately 1 million to establish the facility which are being amortized over the term of the facility the facility has an annual fee of 07 million payable quarterly based on our current credit ratings the facility also contains a crossdefault provision whereby a failure to pay other material financial obligations in excess of 1000 million after grace periods and absent a waiver from the lenders would result in an event of default and the acceleration of the maturity of any outstanding debt under this facility at june 30 2012 no borrowings were outstanding under this agreement 

  

we have a fixed rate promissory note agreement with a financial institution pursuant to which we may borrow up to 1500 million in the form of loan participation notes through one of our subsidiaries in europe the interest rate on borrowings under this agreement is at an allin fixed rate determined by the lender and agreed to by us at the date of each borrowing at june 30 2012 no borrowings were outstanding under this agreement debt issuance costs incurred related to this agreement were de minimis 

  

we have an overdraft borrowing agreement with a financial institution pursuant to which our subsidiary in turkey may be credited to satisfy outstanding negative daily balances arising from its business operations in june 2012 we reduced the maximum total available balance outstanding of the overdraft borrowing agreement from 400 million turkish lira 220 million at the exchange rate at june 30 2012 to 250 million turkish lira 138 million at the exchange rate at june 30 2012 the interest rate applicable to each such credit shall be up to a maximum of 175 basis points per annum above the spot rate charged by the lender or the lender’s floating call rate agreed to by us at each borrowing there were no debt issuance costs incurred related to this agreement the outstanding balance at june 30 2012 was 129 million turkish lira 71 million at the exchange rate at june 30 2012 and is classified as shortterm debt in our consolidated balance sheet 

  

total debt as a percent of total capitalization excluding noncontrolling interests was 32 at june 30 2012 and june 30 2011

cash flows 

  

net cash provided by operating activities was 11267 million 10270 million and 9567 million in fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the increase in cash flows from operating activities as compared with fiscal 2011 was primarily driven by an increase in net earnings favorable levels of accounts payable primarily due to the timing of payments and a decrease in the levels of inventory these improvements were partially offset by the change in other liabilities primarily due to the timing of payments and costs related to employee compensation advertising merchandising and sampling and payroll and other taxes as well as an increase in accounts receivable balances primarily due to the timing of shipments cash flows from operating activities increased in fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010 primarily reflecting the increase in net earnings and the timing and level of accrued income taxes this increase was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable balances due to timing of collections as well as lower levels of accounts payable due to the timing of payments and an increase in inventory in line with forecasted sales activity and to ensure acceptable levels of service 

  

net cash used for investing activities was 4283 million 6069 million and 2814 million in fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the decrease in cash flows used for investing activities as compared with fiscal 2011 primarily reflected a favorable comparison with the fiscal 2011 acquisition of smashbox cosmetics partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures for counters and leasehold improvements the increase in cash flows used for investing activities during fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010 primarily reflected the fiscal 2011 acquisition of smashbox cosmetics as well as higher cash payments for counters and computer hardware and software 

  

net cash used for financing activities was 5851 million 3131 million and 4061 million in fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the change in net cash used for financing activities as compared with fiscal 2011 primarily reflected an increase in treasury stock purchases lower net proceeds from employee stock transactions and an increase in the payment of dividends during the current year as a result of an increase in the annual dividend rate the repayment of the 2012 senior notes during the current year was offset by proceeds from the issuance of shortterm commercial paper subsequent to june 30 2012 we purchased approximately 20 million additional shares of class a common stock for 1042 million pursuant to our share repurchase program the decrease in net cash flows used for financing activities in fiscal 2011 reflected a favorable comparison with fiscal 2010 which included the partial redemption of the 2012 and 2013 senior notes this favorable comparison was offset by an increase in treasury stock purchases and an increase in the common stock dividends during fiscal 2011 

  

dividends 

  

on november 3 2011 our board of directors declared a twoforone stock split on our class a and class b common stock to be effected in the form of a stock dividend as a result of this action one additional share was issued on january 20 2012 for each share held by stockholders of record at the close of business on january 4 2012 the stock split did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations share and per share amounts have been restated for the stock split 

  

during the current year we paid dividends on class a and class b common stock of 525 per share or an aggregate of 2040 million as compared with 375 per share or an aggregate of 1480 million in the prior year 

  

pension and postretirement plan funding 

  

several factors influence the annual funding requirements for our pension plans for the us qualified plan our funding policy consists of annual contributions at a rate that provides for future plan benefits and maintains appropriate funded percentages such contribution is not less than the minimum required by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended “erisa” and subsequent pension legislation and is not more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes for each international plan our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations in addition amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions as detailed in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies and estimates ” the effect of our pension plan funding on future operating results will depend on economic conditions employee demographics mortality rates the number of participants electing to take lumpsum distributions investment performance and funding decisions 

  

for the us qualified plan we maintain an investment strategy of matching the duration of a substantial portion of the plan assets with the duration of the underlying plan liabilities this strategy assisted in maintaining a funded ratio of more than 100 as of june 30 2012 for fiscal 2012 and 2011 we met or exceeded all minimum contributions required by erisa for the us qualified plan these cash contributions to the us qualified plan totaled 756 million and 356 million during fiscal 2012 and 2011 respectively we made discretionary cash contributions to our postretirement medical plan in the united states of 94 million and 84 million during fiscal 2012 and 2011 respectively as we continue to monitor the performance of our plan assets we may decide to make discretionary cash contributions to the us qualified plan or our postretirement plan in the united states during fiscal 2013 but do not have plans to do so at this time 

  

 39  

  

for fiscal 2012 and 2011 we made benefit payments under our nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan of 66 million and 88 million respectively we expect to make benefit payments under this plan during fiscal 2013 of approximately 108 million for fiscal 2012 and 2011 we made cash contributions to our international defined benefit pension plans of 297 million and 341 million respectively we expect to make contributions under these plans during fiscal 2013 of approximately 247 million 

  

commitments and contingencies 

  

certain of our business acquisition agreements include “earnout” provisions these provisions generally require that we pay to the seller or sellers of the business additional amounts based on the performance of the acquired business since the size of each payment depends upon performance of the acquired business we do not expect that such payments will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or financial condition 

  

for additional contingencies refer to “item 3 legal proceedings” 

  

contractual obligations 

  

the following table summarizes scheduled maturities of our contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed and determinable as of june 30 2012 

  

 

   

derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 

  

we address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and may enter into option contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates and interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on our aggregate liability portfolio we also enter into foreign currency forward contracts and may use option contracts not designated as hedging instruments to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes costs associated with entering into these derivative financial instruments have not been material to our consolidated financial results 

  

 40  

  

for each derivative contract entered into where we look to obtain special hedge accounting treatment we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items as well as our riskmanagement objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction the nature of the risk being hedged how the hedging instruments’ effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively and a description of the method of measuring ineffectiveness this process includes linking all derivatives to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions we also formally assess both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items if it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge we will be required to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively 

  

foreign exchange risk management 

  

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge anticipated transactions as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies for periods consistent with our identified exposures the purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on costs and on the cash flows that we receive from foreign subsidiaries the majority of foreign currency forward contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries we may also enter into foreign currency option contracts to hedge anticipated transactions the foreign currency forward contracts entered into to hedge anticipated transactions have been designated as foreign currency cashflow hedges and have varying maturities through the end of march 2014 hedge effectiveness of foreign currency forward contracts is based on a hypothetical derivative methodology and excludes the portion of fair value attributable to the spotforward difference which is recorded in currentperiod earnings the ineffective portion of foreign currency forward contracts is recorded in currentperiod earnings for hedge contracts that are no longer deemed highly effective hedge accounting is discontinued and gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income loss are reclassified to earnings when the underlying forecasted transaction occurs if it is probable that the forecasted transaction will no longer occur then any gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income loss are reclassified to currentperiod earnings as of june 30 2012 these foreign currency cashflow hedges were highly effective in all material respects 

  

at june 30 2012 we had foreign currency forward contracts in the amount of 14760 million the foreign currencies included in foreign currency forward contracts notional value stated in us dollars are principally the british pound 3767 million euro 2234 million canadian dollar 1840 million swiss franc 1299 million australian dollar 1065 million korean won 751 million and thailand baht 513 million 

  

credit risk 

  

as a matter of policy we only enter into derivative contracts with counterparties that have a longterm credit rating of at least a or higher by at least two nationally recognized rating agencies the counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions exposure to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to the gross fair value of contracts in asset positions which totaled 177 million at june 30 2012 to manage this risk we have established counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored accordingly management believes risk of loss under these hedging contracts is remote 

  

certain of our derivative financial instruments contain creditriskrelated contingent features at june 30 2012 we were in a net asset position for certain derivative contracts that contain such features with two counterparties the fair value of those contracts as of june 30 2012 was approximately 28 million as of june 30 2012 we were in compliance with such creditriskrelated contingent features 

  

market risk 

  

we use a valueatrisk model to assess the market risk of our derivative financial instruments valueatrisk represents the potential losses for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors for a specified time period and confidence level we estimate valueatrisk across all of our derivative financial instruments using a model with historical volatilities and correlations calculated over the past 250day period the high low and average measured valueatrisk during fiscal 2012 related to our foreign exchange contracts is as follows 

  

   

the model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 percent confidence level we used a statistical simulation model that valued our derivative financial instruments against one thousand randomly generated market price paths 

our calculated valueatrisk exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may or may not occur it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated based upon actual fluctuations in market rates operating exposures and the timing thereof and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year 

  

 41  

  

we believe however that any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the derivative financial instrument was intended 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

we do not maintain any offbalance sheet arrangements transactions obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities other than operating leases that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations

information systems

in parallel with our sap deployment we are creating a more focused global information technology organization utilizing industry standard processes we are also taking this opportunity to rebalance our information technology resources to better align with our global business growth we plan to continue to explore opportunities to create a more efficient organization 

  

of the many systems currently being utilized the most significant to our business needs are i a centralized data repository of essential attributes for each of the products we offer or plan to offer which enables us to globally manufacture and market products of consistent quality ii a sales analysis system to track weekly sales at the stock keeping unit “sku” level at most significant retail sales locations ie sellthrough data increasing our understanding of consumer preferences and enabling us to coordinate more effectively our product development manufacturing and marketing strategies iii an automated replenishment system with many of our key domestic customers allowing us to replenish inventories for individual points of sale automatically with minimal paperwork and iv an inventory management system to provide us with a global view of finished goods availability relative to forecasted requirements as we continue to modernize our key processes and the related systems and infrastructure we have recently started the development of upgraded capabilities to support our human resource and retail operations the initial focus for fiscal 2012 will be in north america the plan is to progressively deploy these systems globally over the next three years as appropriate according to local requirements and priorities

we are continually benchmarking the performance of the supply chain and will change suppliers and adjust our distribution networks and manufacturing footprint based upon the changing needs of the business as we integrate acquired brands we continually seek new ways to leverage our production and sourcing capabilities to improve our overall supply chain performance

 item 1a risk factors 

  

there are risks associated with an investment in our securities 

  

please consider the following risks and all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k and in our subsequent filings with the securities and exchange commission “sec” our business may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial if any of the events contemplated by the following discussion of risks should occur or other risks arise or develop our business prospects financial condition and results of operations as well as the trading prices of our securities may be adversely affected 

  

the beauty business is highly competitive and if we are unable to compete effectively our results will suffer 

  

we face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world including multinational consumer product companies some of these competitors have greater resources than we do and may be able to respond to changing business and economic conditions more quickly than us competition in the beauty business is based on pricing of products innovation perceived value service to the consumer promotional activities advertising special events new product introductions ecommerce and mcommerce initiatives and other activities it is difficult for us to predict the timing and scale of our competitors’ actions in these areas for example the fragrance category in the united states has in the past been influenced by the high volume of new product introductions by diverse companies across several different distribution channels also the consolidation in the retail trade has resulted in us becoming increasingly dependent on key retailers including largeformat retailers who have increased their bargaining strength this trend has also resulted in an increased risk related to the concentration of our customers a severe adverse impact on their business operations could have a corresponding material adverse effect on us our ability to compete also depends on the continued strength of our brands our ability to attract and retain key talent and other personnel the efficiency of our manufacturing facilities and distribution network and our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property and those other rights used in our business our inability to continue to compete effectively in key countries around the world could have an adverse impact on our business 

  

our inability to anticipate and respond to market trends and changes in consumer preferences could adversely affect our financial results 

  

our continued success depends on our ability to anticipate gauge and react in a timely and costeffective manner to changes in consumer tastes for skin care makeup fragrance and hair care products their attitudes toward our industry and brands as well as to where and how consumers shop for those products we must continually work to develop produce and market new products maintain and adapt our “hightouch” services to existing and emerging distribution channels maintain and enhance the recognition of our brands achieve a favorable mix of products and refine our approach as to how and where we market and sell our products while we devote considerable effort and resources to shape analyze and respond to consumer preferences we recognize that consumer tastes cannot be predicted with certainty and can change rapidly the issue is compounded by the increasing use of social and digital media by consumers and the speed by which information and opinions are shared if we are unable to anticipate and respond to sudden challenges that we may face in the marketplace trends in the market for our products and changing consumer demands and sentiment our financial results will suffer 

  

our future success depends on our ability to achieve our longterm strategy 

  

achieving our longterm objectives will require investment in new capabilities brands categories distribution channels technologies and geographic markets these investments may result in shortterm costs without any current revenues and therefore may be dilutive to our earnings at least in the short term in addition we may dispose of or discontinue select brands or streamline operations and incur costs or special charges in doing so although we believe that our strategy will lead to longterm growth in revenue and profitability we may not realize in full or in part the anticipated benefits the failure to realize benefits which may be due to our inability to execute plans global or local economic conditions competition changes in the beauty industry and the other risks described herein could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

  

acquisitions may expose us to additional risks 

  

we continuously review acquisition opportunities that would expand our current product offerings our distribution channels increase the size and geographic scope of our operations or otherwise offer growth and operating efficiency opportunities if required the financing for any of these acquisitions could result in an increase in our indebtedness dilute the interests of our stockholders or both acquisitions entail numerous risks which may include 

  

·   difficulties in assimilating acquired operations or products including the loss of key employees from or customers of acquired businesses 

·   diversion of management’s attention from our core businesses 

·   adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and 

·   risks of entering distribution channels categories or markets in which we have limited or no prior experience 

  

our failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate acquisitions on favorable terms 

  

completed acquisitions typically result in additional goodwill and an increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet we are required at least annually or as facts and circumstances warrant to test goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to determine if impairment has occurred if the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the fair value of other intangible assets with indefinite lives in the period the determination is made we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

a general economic downturn or sudden disruption in business conditions may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items andor the financial strength of our customers that are retailers which could adversely affect our financial results 

  

the general level of consumer spending is affected by a number of factors including general economic conditions inflation interest rates energy costs and consumer confidence generally all of which are beyond our control consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower and may impact sales of our products a decline in consumer purchases of discretionary items also tends to impact our customers that are retailers we generally extend credit to a retailer based on an evaluation of its financial condition usually without requiring collateral however the financial difficulties of a retailer could cause us to curtail or eliminate business with that customer we may also assume more credit risk relating to the receivables from that retailer our inability to collect the receivable from one of our largest customers or from a group of customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition if a retailer was to liquidate we may incur additional costs if we choose to purchase the retailer’s inventory of our products to protect brand equity 

  

in addition sudden disruptions in business conditions for example as a consequence of events such as a pandemic or those that are currently taking place in the middle east or as a result of a terrorist attack retaliation and the threat of further attacks or retaliation or as a result of adverse weather conditions or climate changes or seismic events can have a short and sometimes longterm impact on consumer spending 

  

events that impact consumers’ willingness or ability to travel andor purchase our products while traveling may impact our travel retail business which is a significant contributor to our overall results 

  

a downturn in the economies in which we sell our products or a sudden disruption of business conditions in those economies could adversely affect our sales and profitability 

  

volatility in the financial markets and a related economic downturn in key markets or markets generally throughout the world could have a material adverse effect on our business while we currently generate significant cash flows from our ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities credit markets may experience significant disruptions deterioration in global financial markets could make future financing difficult or more expensive if any financial institutions that are parties to our undrawn revolving credit facility supporting our commercial paper program or other financing arrangements such as interest rate or foreign exchange hedging instruments were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us this could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain interest rate or foreign currency exposures which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

  

changes in laws regulations and policies that affect our business could adversely affect our financial results 

  

our business is subject to numerous laws regulations and policies changes in the laws regulations and policies including the interpretation or enforcement thereof that affect or will affect our business including changes in accounting standards tax laws and regulations environmental or climate change laws regulations or accords trade rules and customs regulations and the outcome and expense of legal or regulatory proceedings and any action we may take as a result could adversely affect our financial results 

  

our success depends in part on the quality and safety of our products 

  

our success depends in part on the quality and safety of our products if our products are found to be defective or unsafe or if they otherwise fail to meet our consumers’ standards our relationships with customers or consumers could suffer the appeal of one or more of our brands could be diminished and we could lose sales andor become subject to liability claims any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

our success depends in part on our key personnel 

  

our success depends in part on our ability to retain our key personnel including our executive officers and senior management team the unexpected loss of one or more of our key employees could adversely affect our business our success also depends in part on our continuing ability to identify hire train and retain other highly qualified personnel competition for these employees can be intense we may not be able to attract assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business this risk may be exacerbated by the stresses associated with the implementation of our strategic plan and other initiatives 

  

we are subject to risks related to our foreign operations 

  

we operate on a global basis with a majority of our fiscal 2011 net sales and operating income generated outside the united states 

  

we intend to reinvest these earnings in our foreign operations indefinitely except where we are able to repatriate these earnings to the united states without material incremental tax provision a portion of our cash and cash equivalents that result from these earnings remain outside the united states 

  

we maintain offices in over 40 countries and have key operational facilities located outside the united states that manufacture warehouse or distribute goods for sale throughout the world foreign operations are subject to many risks and uncertainties including 

  

·   fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which can affect our results of operations the value of our foreign assets the relative prices at which we and foreign competitors sell products in the same markets and the cost of certain inventory and noninventory items required in our operations 

·   changes in foreign laws regulations and policies including restrictions on trade import and export license requirements and tariffs and taxes as well as changes in united states laws and regulations relating to foreign trade and investment and 

·   adverse weather conditions social economic and geopolitical conditions such as terrorist attacks war or other military action 

  

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects results of operations and financial condition 

  

a disruption in operations or our supply chain could adversely affect our business and financial results 

  

as a company engaged in manufacturing and distribution on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including industrial accidents environmental events strikes and other labor disputes disruptions in supply chain or information systems loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites product quality control safety licensing requirements and other regulatory issues as well as natural disasters and other external factors over which we have no control if such an event were to occur it could have an adverse affect on our business and financial results 

  

our information systems and websites may be susceptible to outages hacking and other risks 

  

we have information systems that support our business processes including product development marketing sales order processing production distribution finance and intracompany communications throughout the world we have ecommerce and other internet websites in the united states and many other countries these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire floods power loss telecommunications failures breakins and similar events despite the implementation of network security measures our systems may be vulnerable to computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering the occurrence of these or other events could disrupt or damage our information systems and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

  

we are subject to risks associated with implementing global information systems 

  

as part of smi we are implementing enterprisewide global programs intended to deliver a single set of integrated data processes and technologies which would be scalable and used to standardize business processes across brands regions and functions we anticipate the continued migration of our operations to sap with the majority of our locations to be enabled through fiscal 2013 like most entitywide changes to software systems the implementation of smi involves risks and uncertainties failure to implement smi as planned in terms of timing specifications andor costs could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

  

the trading prices of our securities periodically may rise or fall based on the accuracy of predictions of our earnings or other financial performance 

  

our business planning process is designed to maximize our longterm strength growth and profitability not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter we believe that this longerterm focus is in the best interests of the company and our stockholders at the same time however we recognize that it may be helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our forecast of net sales earnings per share and other financial metrics or projections accordingly when we announced our yearend financial results for fiscal 2011 we provided guidance as to a number of assumptions including our expected net sales and earnings per share for the fiscal year ending june 30 2012 and the quarter ending september 30 2011 while we generally expect to provide updates to our guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter we assume no responsibility to update any of our forwardlooking statements at such times or otherwise in addition the longerterm guidance we provide is based on goals that we believe at the time guidance is given are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years such targets are more difficult to predict than our current quarter and fiscal year expectations 

  

in all of our public statements when we make or update a forwardlooking statement about our net sales andor earnings expectations or expectations regarding restructuring or other initiatives we accompany such statements directly or by reference to a public document with a list of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we expect such a list is included among other places in our earnings press release and in our periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission eg in our reports on form 10k and form 10q these and other factors may make it difficult for us and for outside observers such as research analysts to predict what our earnings will be in any given fiscal quarter or year 

  

outside analysts and investors have the right to make their own predictions of our financial results for any future period outside analysts however have access to no more material information about our results or plans than any other public investor and we do not endorse their predictions as to our future performance nor do we assume any responsibility to correct the predictions of outside analysts or others when they differ from our own internal expectations if and when we announce actual results that differ from those that outside analysts or others have been predicting the market price of our securities could be affected investors who rely on the predictions of outside analysts or others when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk we take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in the prices of our securities 

  

failure to adequately maintain the security of our electronic and other confidential information could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

  

we are dependent upon automated information technology processes as part of our normal business activities we collect and store certain confidential information including personal information with respect to customers and employees we may share some of this information with vendors who assist us with certain aspects of our business moreover the success of our ecommerce operations depends upon the secure transmission of confidential and personal data over public networks including the use of cashless payments any failure on the part of us or our vendors to maintain the security of our confidential data and our employees’ and customers’ personal information including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information could result in business disruption damage to our reputation financial obligations to third parties fines penalties regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs and also result in deterioration in our employees’ and customers’ confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages and thus could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to enhance our information security systems and could result in a disruption to our operations 

  

as we outsource more functions we will become more dependent on the entities performing those functions 

  

as part of our longterm strategy we are continually looking for opportunities to provide essential business services in a more costeffective manner in some cases this requires the outsourcing of functions or parts of functions that can be performed more effectively by external service providers these include certain information systems functions such as information technology operations and certain human resource functions such as employee benefit plan administration while we believe we conduct appropriate due diligence before entering into agreements with the outsourcing entity the failure of one or more entities to provide the expected services provide them on a timely basis or to provide them at the prices we expect may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

  

  

we are controlled by the lauder family as a result of their control of us the lauder family has the ability to prevent or cause a change in control or approve prevent or influence certain actions by us 

  

as of august 15 2011 members of the lauder family beneficially own directly or indirectly shares of the company’s class a common stock with one vote per share and class b common stock with 10 votes per share having approximately 868 of the outstanding voting power of the common stock in addition there are five members of the lauder family who are employees including three who are members of our board of directors another family member is on our board and is a party to a consulting agreement and a license agreement with us as a result of the stock ownership and their positions at the company the lauder family has the ability to exercise significant control and influence over our business including without limitation all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors amendments to the certificate of incorporation and significant corporate transactions such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets for the foreseeable future 

  

we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the new york stock exchange rules and as a result are relying on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that are designed to provide protection to stockholders of companies that are not “controlled companies” 

  

the lauder family and their related entities own more than 50 of the total voting power of our common shares and as a result we are a “controlled company” under the new york stock exchange corporate governance standards as a controlled company we are exempt under the new york stock exchange standards from the obligation to comply with certain new york stock exchange corporate governance requirements including the requirements 

  

·   that a majority of our board of directors consists of independent directors 

·   that we have a nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities and 

·   that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities 

  

while we have voluntarily caused our board to have a majority of independent directors and the written charters of our nominating and board affairs committee and the compensation committee to have the required provisions we are not requiring our nominating and board affairs committee and compensation committee to be comprised solely of independent directors as a result of our use of the “controlled company” exemptions investors will not have the same protection afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the new york stock exchange corporate governance requirements

we are involved from time to time in litigation and other legal proceedings incidental to our business management believes that the outcome of current litigation and legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial condition however management’s assessment of our current litigation and other legal proceedings could change in light of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions or other proceedings pending against us not presently known to us or determinations by judges juries or other finders of fact which are not in accord with management’s evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such litigation or proceedings reasonably possible losses in addition to the amount accrued for litigation and other legal proceedings are not material to our consolidated financial statements

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition at june 30 2011 and our results of operations for the three fiscal years ended june 30 2011 are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements these estimates and assumptions can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition inventory pension and other postretirement benefit costs goodwill other intangible assets and longlived assets income taxes and derivatives 

  

management of the company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of the company’s board of directors 

  

revenue recognition 

  

revenues from product sales are recognized upon transfer of ownership including passage of title to the customer and transfer of the risk of loss related to those goods in the americas region sales are generally recognized at the time the product is shipped to the customer and in the europe the middle east  africa and asiapacific regions sales are generally recognized based upon the customer’s receipt in certain circumstances transfer of title takes place at the point of sale for example at our retail stores 

  

revenues are reported on a net sales basis which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual product returns received discounts incentive arrangements with retailers and an amount established for anticipated product returns our practice is to accept product returns from retailers only if properly requested authorized and approved in accepting returns we typically provide a credit to the retailer against accounts receivable from that retailer as a percentage of gross sales returns were 35 43 and 44 in fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively and the improvement reflects efforts to work with our customers to improve their forecasting and product mix to better address their inventory requirements 

  

our sales return accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net sales this accrual is calculated based on a history of actual returns estimated future returns and information provided by retailers regarding their inventory levels consideration of these factors results in an accrual for anticipated sales returns that reflects increases or decreases related to seasonal fluctuations experience has shown a relationship between retailer inventory levels and sales returns in the subsequent period as well as a consistent pattern of returns due to the seasonal nature of our business in addition as necessary specific accruals may be established for significant future known or anticipated events the types of known or anticipated events that we have considered and will continue to consider include but are not limited to the financial condition of our customers store closings by retailers changes in the retail environment and our decision to continue to support new and existing products 

  

in the ordinary course of business we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions based upon the evaluation of accounts receivable aging specific exposures and historical trends our allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net earnings the allowance for doubtful accounts was 339 million and 343 million as of june 30 2011 and 2010 respectively the allowance for doubtful accounts was reduced by 99 million 158 million and 141 million for customer deductions and writeoffs in fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively and increased by 95 million 87 million and 292 million for additional provisions in fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

  

inventory 

  

we state our inventory at the lower of cost or fairmarket value with cost being based on standard cost which approximates actual cost on the firstin firstout fifo method we believe this method most closely matches the flow of our products from manufacture through sale the reported net value of our inventory includes saleable products promotional products raw materials and componentry and work in process that will be sold or used in future periods inventory cost includes raw materials direct labor and overhead as well as inbound freight manufacturing overhead is allocated to the cost of inventory based on the normal production capacity unallocated overhead during periods of abnormally low production levels are recognized as cost of sales in the period in which they are incurred 

  

we also record an inventory obsolescence reserve which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated realizable value based on various product sales projections this reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales in addition and as necessary we may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events 

  

pension and other postretirement benefit costs 

  

we offer the following benefits to some or all of our employees a domestic trustbased noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan “us qualified plan” and an unfunded nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations collectively with the us qualified plan the “domestic plans” a domestic contributory defined contribution plan international pension plans which vary by country consisting of both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans deferred compensation arrangements and certain other postretirement benefit plans 

  

  

the amounts needed to fund future payouts under these plans are subject to numerous assumptions and variables certain significant variables require us to make assumptions that are within our control such as an anticipated discount rate expected rate of return on plan assets and future compensation levels we evaluate these assumptions with our actuarial advisors and select assumptions that we believe reflect the economics underlying our pension and postretirement obligations while we believe these assumptions are within accepted industry ranges an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a direct impact on reported net earnings 

  

the discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated longterm bonds for fiscal 2011 we used a discount rate for our domestic plans of 540 and varying rates on our international plans of between 125 and 825 the discount rate for our domestic plans is based on a bond portfolio that includes only longterm bonds with an aa rating or equivalent from a major rating agency we believe the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio is expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of our domestic plans for fiscal 2011 we used an expected return on plan assets of 775 for our us qualified plan and varying rates of between 250 and 800 for our international plans in determining the longterm rate of return for a plan we consider the historical rates of return the nature of the plan’s investments and an expectation for the plan’s investment strategies see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data — note 13 — pension deferred compensation and postretirement benefit plans ” for details regarding the nature of our pension and postretirement plan investments the difference between actual and expected return on plan assets is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income those gainslosses that are subject to amortization over future periods will be recognized as a component of the net periodic benefit cost in such future periods for fiscal 2011 our pension plans had actual return on assets of approximately 92 million as compared with expected return on assets of approximately 57 million which resulted in a net deferred gain of approximately 35 million substantially all of which is currently subject to be amortized over periods ranging from approximately 6 to 25 years the actual return on assets was primarily related to the performance of equity markets during the past fiscal year 

  

a 25 basispoint change in the discount rate or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have had the following effect on fiscal 2011 pension expense 

  

   

our postretirement plans are comprised of health care plans that could be impacted by health care cost trend rates which may have a significant effect on the amounts reported a onepercentagepoint change in assumed health care cost trend rates for fiscal 2011 would have had the following effects 

  

   

for fiscal 2012 we are using a discount rate for the domestic plans of 540 and varying rates for our international plans of between 125 and 825 we are using an expected return on plan assets of 775 for the us qualified plan and varying rates for our international pension plans of between 200 and 825 the net change in these assumptions from those used in fiscal 2011 will result in an increase in pension expense of approximately 04 million in fiscal 2012 we will continue to monitor the market conditions relative to these assumptions and adjust them accordingly 

  

goodwill other intangible assets and longlived assets 

  

goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets other indefinitelived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized 

  

  

we assess goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles at least annually for impairment as of the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if certain events or circumstances warrant we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which is one level below our operating segments we identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and management of each reporting unit regularly reviews the operating results of those components we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to determine carrying values for our reporting units impairment testing is performed in two steps i we determine if an indication of impairment exists by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value and ii if there is an impairment we measure the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill the impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets encompasses calculating a fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value if the carrying value exceeds the fair value an impairment charge is recorded 

  

testing goodwill for impairment requires us to estimate fair values of reporting units using significant estimates and assumptions the assumptions made will impact the outcome and ultimate results of the testing we use industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and in certain instances we engage thirdparty valuation specialists for advice to determine fair value of the reporting unit we generally use an equal weighting of the income and market approaches in certain circumstances equal weighting will not be applied if one of these methods may be less applicable eg only the income approach would be used for reporting units with existing negative margins we believe both approaches are equally relevant and the most reliable indications of fair value because the fair value of product or service companies is more dependent on the ability to generate earnings than on the value of the assets used in the production process 

  

under the income approach we determine fair value using a discounted cash flow method projecting future cash flows of each reporting unit as well as a terminal value and discounting such cash flows at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows 

  

under the market approach we utilize information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units which creates valuation multiples that are applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested to value the reporting unit 

  

the key estimates and factors used in these two approaches include but are not limited to revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts terminal value the weightedaverage cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and comparable market multiples the fiscal 2011 compound annual growth rate of sales for the first five to eight years of our projections as considered appropriate for the individual reporting units ranged between 3 and 19 with the higher growth rates in those reporting units that start with the smallest base in fiscal 2011 the fiscal 2010 compound annual growth rate of sales for the first four to eight years of our projections ranged between 3 and 24 with the higher growth rates in those reporting units that start with the smallest base in fiscal 2010 for reporting units with positive earnings growth in the corresponding earnings before interest and taxes ranged from 6 to 109 in fiscal 2011 as compared with 9 to 161 in fiscal 2010 the terminal growth rates were projected at 3 after four to eight years in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 which reflects our estimate of long term market and gross domestic product growth the weightedaverage cost of capital used to discount future cash flows ranged from 75 to 16 in fiscal 2011 as compared with 9 to 17 in fiscal 2010 the range of market multiples used in our fiscal 2011 impairment testing was from 15 to 3 times trailingtwelvemonth sales and 11 to 12 times trailingtwelvemonth earnings before interest taxes and depreciation and amortization the range of market multiples used in our fiscal 2010 impairment testing was from 05 to 3 times trailingtwelvemonth sales and between 9 to 12 times trailingtwelvemonth earnings before interest taxes and depreciation and amortization future changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the results of our reviews for impairment of goodwill however a decrease of 100 basis points in our terminal growth rate or an increase of 100 basis points in our weightedaverage cost of capital would still result in a fair value calculation exceeding our book value for each of our reporting units except for the ojon reporting unit see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — goodwill and other intangible asset impairments”   changes in the valuation assumptions from those used in the prior year primarily reflect the impact of the current economic environment on the reporting units and their projected future results of operations 

  

to determine fair value of other indefinitelived intangible assets we use an income approach the relieffromroyalty method this method assumes that in lieu of ownership a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to obtain the rights to use the comparable asset other indefinitelived intangible assets’ fair values require significant judgments in determining both the assets’ estimated cash flows as well as the appropriate discount and royalty rates applied to those cash flows to determine fair value changes in such estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results the fiscal 2011 and 2010 terminal growth rate applied to future cash flows was 3 and the fiscal 2011 and 2010 discount rates ranged from 10 to 18 and 11 to 19 respectively the fiscal 2011 and 2010 royalty rates ranged from 05 to 12 and 05 to11 respectively 

  

we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable when such events or changes in circumstances occur a recoverability test is performed comparing projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset or asset group to its carrying value if the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value an impairment would be recorded for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value which is determined by discounting future cash flows 

  

  

income taxes 

  

we account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns as of june 30 2011 we have current net deferred tax assets of 2607 million and noncurrent net deferred tax assets of 611 million the net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization as well as the continued application of currently anticipated tax rates included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance of 695 million for deferred tax assets where management believes it is morelikelythannot that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the relevant jurisdiction based on our assessments no additional valuation allowance is required if we determine that a deferred tax asset will not be realizable an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will result in a reduction of net earnings at that time 

  

we provide tax reserves for us federal state local and foreign exposures relating to periods subject to audit the development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues potential outcomes and timing and is a subjective critical estimate we assess our tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting dates for those tax positions where it is morelikelythannot that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those tax positions where it is not morelikelythannot that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements we classify applicable interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes although the outcome relating to these exposures is uncertain in management’s opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating from these exposures in certain circumstances the ultimate outcome of exposures and risks involves significant uncertainties which render them inestimable if actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates they could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations 

  

derivatives 

  

we address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and may enter into option contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates and interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on our aggregate liability portfolio we also enter into foreign currency forward contracts and may use option contracts not designated as hedging instruments to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes hedge effectiveness is documented assessed and monitored by employees who are qualified to make such assessments and monitor the instruments variables that are external to us such as social political and economic risks may have an impact on our hedging program and the results thereof 

  

our derivative financial instruments are recorded as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measured at fair value all derivatives outstanding as of june 30 2011 are i designated as a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment “fairvalue” hedge ii designated as a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability “foreign currency cashflow” hedge or iii not designated as a hedging instrument changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a fairvalue hedge that is highly effective are recorded in currentperiod earnings along with the loss or gain on the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk including losses or gains on unrecognized firm commitments changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a foreign currency cashflow hedge of a foreigncurrencydenominated forecasted transaction that is highly effective are recorded in other comprehensive income loss “oci” gains and losses deferred in oci are then recognized in currentperiod earnings when earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged foreigncurrencydenominated forecasted transaction eg when periodic settlements on a variablerate asset or liability are recorded in earnings changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are reported in currentperiod earnings 

  

for a discussion on the quantitative impact of market risks related to our derivative financial instruments see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources — market risk” 

  

quantitative analysis 

  

during the threeyear period ended june 30 2011 there have not been material changes in the assumptions underlying these critical accounting policies nor to the related significant estimates the results of our business underlying these assumptions have not differed significantly from our expectations 

  

while we believe that the estimates that we have made are proper and the related results of operations for the period are presented fairly in all material respects other assumptions could reasonably be justified that would change the amount of reported net sales cost of sales operating expenses or our provision for income taxes as they relate to the provisions for anticipated sales returns allowance for doubtful accounts inventory obsolescence reserve and income taxes for fiscal 2011 had these estimates been changed simultaneously by 25 in either direction our reported gross profit would have increased or decreased by approximately 48 million operating expenses would have changed by approximately 08 million and the provision for income taxes would have increased or decreased by approximately 07 million the collective impact of these changes on operating income net earnings attributable to the estée lauder companies inc and net earnings attributable to the estée lauder companies inc per diluted common share would be an increase or decrease of approximately 56 million 63 million and 03 respectively 

  

  

results of operations 

  

we manufacture market and sell beauty products including those in the skin care makeup fragrance and hair care categories which are distributed in over 150 countries and territories the following table is a comparative summary of operating results from continuing operations for fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 and reflects the basis of presentation described in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data — note 2 — summary of significant accounting policies and note 20 — segment data and related information ” for all periods presented products and services that do not meet our definition of skin care makeup fragrance and hair care have been included in the “other” category 

  

   

  

the following table presents certain consolidated earnings data as a percentage of net sales 

  

   

in order to meet the demands of consumers we continually introduce new products support new and established products through advertising sampling and merchandising and phase out existing products that no longer meet the needs of our consumers the economics of developing producing launching and supporting products impact our sales and operating performance each period the introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products which we take into account in our business planning 

  

we operate on a global basis with the majority of our net sales generated outside the united states accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our results of operations therefore we present certain net sales information excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations to provide a framework for assessing the performance of our underlying business outside the united states constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant periodoverperiod we calculate constant currency information by translating currentperiod results using prior year weighted average foreign currency exchange rates 

  

overview 

  

we believe that the best way to continue to increase stockholder value is to provide our customers and consumers with the products and services that they have come to expect from us in the most efficient and profitable manner while recognizing their changing shopping habits to be the global leader in prestige beauty we are implementing a longterm strategy that is guiding us through fiscal 2014 the strategy has numerous initiatives across geographic regions product categories brands and functions that are designed to leverage our strengths make us more productive and grow our sales 

  

we believe we have a strong diverse brand portfolio with global reach and potential our strategy continues to build on and leverage our history of outstanding creativity innovation and entrepreneurship we have succeeded in expanding our “hightouch” service model and will continue to look for ways to expand it in newer channels and within geographic regions we are expanding our efforts to evolve our ecommercebased online strategy into a multipronged digital strategy encompassing ecommerce as well as digital and social media we are leveraging our regional organization in an effort to assure that we are locally relevant in each market 

  

as part of our strategy we are continuing to shift our category mix towards higher margin categories with greater global growth potential skin care our most profitable product category is a strategic priority for our innovation and investment spending particularly in the asiapacific region we also focused our attention on luxury consumers across all categories and have seen an improvement in the net sales of many of our higherend prestige products due to an improvement in the luxury retail environment 

  

  

we are strengthening our geographic presence by seeking share growth in large imagebuilding cities within core markets such as the united states the united kingdom france italy and japan in addition we continue to prioritize efforts to expand our presence and accelerate share growth in emerging markets such as china russia the middle east eastern europe and brazil we continue to expand our digital presence which resulted in continued growth in net sales of our products sold over the internet in north america we recognized the need to drive profitable growth in our traditional department store channel and saw many benefits from the changes we implemented in prior years and continued to reshape our organization to meet the needs of the changing retail landscape internationally we took actions to continue profitable growth in european perfumeries and pharmacies and in department stores in asia while emphasizing our skin care and makeup initiatives to boost our travel retail business and continuing efforts to grow our online specialty retailer and prestige salon businesses the travel retail business continues to be a source of sales growth and profitability our business in this channel is benefiting from the implementation of programs we designed to enhance consumers “hightouch” experiences and convert travelers into purchasers in addition we see travel retail as another way to capture the attention of travelers from emerging markets who either buy in the channel in stores at their destination or when they return to their homes 

  

our “hightouch” approach to marketing our products is a key component of our strategy it is designed to promote the total value we offer by leveraging our inperson and virtual assets as well as merchandising and education to provide a customized consumer experience in fiscal 2011 we continued to invest in “hightouch” service capabilities in existing channels such as the rollout of new department store formats as well as newer channels such as mcommerce 

  

while most of the focus is on increasing sales and taking advantage of appropriate opportunities in each market we continued to implement other initiatives designed to drive out nonvalue added costs optimize productivity and increase financial discipline to optimize our portfolio we are continuing to focus on improving our margins and share in our distribution channels we are also continuing to reenergize certain of our brands through the introduction of products that feature advances in research and technology and focused marketing campaigns at the same time we are investing in initiatives to incubate and develop next generation products and brands as well as continuing our overall success in driving turnaround brands toward sustainable profitability levels we are continuing to build our regional organizations and leveraging them to increase effectiveness and efficiencies while utilizing strategic partnerships alliances and licensing to build scale in research and development distribution and thirdparty manufacturing 

  

at this time we do not believe the recent economic uncertainty and financial market volatility taking place in the united states and certain european countries will have a significant impact on our business this is due in part to our belief that we are better positioned as a result of our strategy to manage our business effectively and efficiently and we will allocate resources appropriately however if the degree of uncertainty or volatility worsens or is prolonged then there will likely be a negative effect on ongoing consumer confidence demand and spending and as a result our business currently we believe general economic and other uncertainties still exist in select markets in which we do business such as in japan north america and certain countries in europe we continue to monitor global economic uncertainties and other risks that may affect our business the disasters that occurred in japan during the fiscal year did not have a significant impact on our business or our consolidated financial results for fiscal 2011 at this time we believe the ongoing consequences may continue for the short term however we cannot predict with certainty the magnitude or duration of the impact and we will continue to monitor the situation 

  

looking ahead to fiscal 2012 we plan to continue building on our strengths we have a strong diverse and highly valuable brand portfolio with global reach and potential as well as a track record of outstanding creativity innovation entrepreneurship and healthy growth we believe our “hightouch” service model has potential beyond department stores and believe we have a passionate highlytalented workforce to help us achieve our longterm strategy our balance sheet cash flows and gross margin are strong however we continue to operate in a challenging environment while net sales and operating results improved dramatically from fiscal 2010 we do not expect the same levels of yearoveryear improvements to continue we have a number of areas to improve including further enhancements to our cost structure sharing operational best practices internally increasing traffic to where our products are sold and further diversification of distribution channels we also plan on continuing to allocate our spending to the significant modernization of our global information systems which includes our strategic modernization initiative as well as other initiatives and shift our focus from gift with purchase activities to advertising merchandising and sampling initiatives we expect these strategies will help improve our cost of sales margin but will increase our operating expense margin over the next fiscal year 

  

  

returns and charges associated with restructuring activities 

  

in an effort to drive down costs and achieve synergies within our organization in february 2009 we announced the implementation of a multifaceted cost savings program the “program” to position the company to achieve longterm profitable growth we anticipate the program will result in related restructuring and other special charges inclusive of cumulative charges recorded to date and through the remainder of the program totaling between 350 million and 450 million before taxes while we will continue to seek cost savings opportunities our current plans are to identify and approve specific initiatives under the program through fiscal 2012 and execute those initiatives through fiscal 2013 the total amount of charges pretax associated with the program recorded plus other initiatives approved through june 30 2011 is approximately 303 million to 308 million of which approximately 1985 million to 200 million relates to restructuring charges approximately 50 million of other costs to implement the initiatives approximately 385 million to 42 million in sales returns and approximately 16 million in inventory writeoffs the restructuring charges are comprised of approximately 1515 million to 153 million of employeerelated costs approximately 27 million of other exit costs and contract terminations substantially all of which have resulted in or will result in cash expenditures and approximately 20 million in noncash asset writeoffs the total amount of cumulative charges pretax associated with the program recorded from inception through june 30 2011 was 2394 million 

  

we expect that the implementation of this program combined with other ongoing cost savings efforts will result in savings of approximately 675 million to 725 million program inception through the end of fiscal 2011 is approximately 560 million including the reduction of certain costs relative to an assumed normalized spending pattern our longrange forecast for operating margin reflects these anticipated savings net of strategic reinvestments 

  

the program focuses on a redesign of our organizational structure in order to integrate the company in a more cohesive way and operate more globally across brands and functions the principal aspect of the program was the reduction of the workforce by approximately 2000 employees specific actions taken during fiscal 2011 and 2010 included 

  

·   resize and reorganize the organization — we continued the realignment and optimization of our organization to better leverage scale improve productivity reduce complexity and achieve cost savings in each region and across various functions this included reduction of the workforce which occurred through the consolidation of certain functions which we achieved through a combination of normal attrition and job eliminations and the closure and consolidation of certain distribution and office facilities 

  

·   turnaround or exit unprofitable operations — to improve the profitability in certain of our brands and regions we have selectively exited certain channels of distribution categories and markets and have made changes to turnaround others this included the exit from the global wholesale distribution of our prescriptives brand and the reformulation of ojon brand products in connection with these activities we incurred charges for product returns inventory writeoffs reduction of workforce and termination of contracts 

  

·   outsourcing — in order to balance the growing need for information technology support with our efforts to provide the most efficient and cost effective solutions we continued the outsourcing of certain information technology processes we incurred costs to transition services to outsource providers and employeerelated costs 

  

restructuring charges 

  

the following table presents aggregate restructuring charges related to the program 

  

   

  

  

the following table presents accrued restructuring charges and the related activity under the program 

  

   

accrued restructuring charges at june 30 2011 are expected to result in cash expenditures funded from cash provided by operations of approximately 29 million 6 million and 2 million in fiscal 2012 2013 and 2014 respectively 

  

total returns and charges associated with restructuring activities 

  

the following table presents total returns and charges associated with restructuring activities related to the program 

  

   

during fiscal 2011 we recorded 46 million reflecting sales returns less related cost of sales of 12 million and a writeoff of inventory of 70 million associated with turnaround operations primarily related to the reformulation of ojon brand products 

  

during fiscal 2010 we recorded 157 million reflecting sales returns less related cost of sales of 25 million and 104 million for the writeoff of inventory associated with exiting unprofitable operations primarily related to the exit from the global wholesale distribution of the prescriptives brand 

  

during fiscal 2009 we recorded 81 million reflecting sales returns less related cost of sales of 12 million and a writeoff of inventory of 80 million associated with exiting unprofitable operations 

  

other special charges in connection with the implementation of actions taken under this program primarily relate to consulting and other professional services 

  

  

goodwill and other intangible asset impairments 

  

as of our annual stepone goodwill impairment test on april 1 2011 all reporting units’ fair values substantially exceeded their respective carrying values as of our annual indefinitelived asset impairment test on april 1 2011 we determined as a result of a planned discontinuation that the carrying values of two brand trademarks exceeded their estimated fair values which were based on the use of a royalty rate to determine discounted projected future cash flows “relieffromroyalty method” as a result we recognized an impairment charge of 17 million for the carrying values of the related trademarks these impairment charges were reflected in the makeup and skin care product categories and in the americas region we also determined that the trademark related to the darphin reporting unit had an estimated fair value exceeding its carrying value by approximately 13 and the trademark related to the ojon reporting unit had an estimated fair value that equals its carrying value as of june 30 2011 the carrying values of the trademarks were 90 million and 100 million respectively the estimated fair values of the trademarks were based upon the relieffromroyalty method the key assumptions that were used to determine the estimated fair value of the darphin trademark were predicated on new market initiatives including expanded international distribution the key assumptions that were used to determine the estimated fair value of the ojon trademark were predicated on new market initiatives including expanded international distribution and consumer reception to the reformulated product line if such plans do not materialize if there is a delay in new market initiatives or if there is a decline in the business environment a resulting change in the key assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of these trademarks and it is possible we could recognize an impairment charge in the future the fair values of all other indefinitelived intangible assets substantially exceeded their respective carrying values 

  

during the third quarter of fiscal 2011 the ojon reporting unit reassessed and subsequently altered the timing of new market initiatives including the rollout of reformulated product lines and certain components of its future international expansion plans resulting in revisions to its internal forecasts we concluded that these changes in circumstances in the ojon reporting unit triggered the need for an interim impairment review of its trademark and goodwill additionally these changes in circumstances were also an indicator that the carrying amount of the customer list may not be recoverable we performed an interim impairment test for the trademark and a recoverability test for the customer list as of february 28 2011 for the customer list we concluded that the carrying amount of this asset was recoverable however for the ojon trademark we concluded that the carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value which was based on the relieffromroyalty method as a result we recognized an impairment charge of 70 million after adjusting the carrying value of the trademark we completed an interim impairment test for goodwill and recorded an impairment charge for the remaining goodwill related to the ojon reporting unit of 293 million at the exchange rate in effect at that time the fair value of the reporting unit was based upon the income approach utilizing estimated cash flows and a terminal value discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows in fiscal 2010 the income approach was used in conjunction with the market approach but due to the reporting unit’s existing negative margins the market approach was deemed not applicable these impairment charges were reflected in the hair care and skin care product categories and in the americas region 

  

although our financial performance reflected improved economic conditions we expect global economic uncertainties to continue to impact our business as the duration and magnitude of the volatility of the current economic conditions remain uncertain we will continue to monitor and evaluate the potential impact on our business and on our interim and annual impairment testing accordingly it is possible that we would recognize an impairment charge in the future with respect to goodwill other intangible assets and longlived assets 

  

fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010 

  

net sales 

  

net sales increased 13 or 10142 million to 88100 million reflecting increases in all geographic regions and product categories excluding the impact of foreign currency translation net sales increased 12 during fiscal 2010 we undertook an initiative to identify certain underperforming stock keeping units “skus” for the purposes of evaluating their relevance to our longterm perfumery strategy in the europe the middle east  africa region based on this evaluation we decided to discontinue certain of these products in perfumeries and recorded a charge of approximately 31 million to reflect thenanticipated returns of products from participating retailers this resulted in a favorable comparison with fiscal 2010 

  

the following discussions of net sales by product categories and geographic regions exclude the impact of returns associated with restructuring activities of 46 million and 157 million recorded during fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 respectively we believe the following analysis of net sales better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business

since certain promotional activities are a component of sales or cost of sales and the timing and level of promotions vary with our promotional calendar we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in the cost of sales percentage in addition future cost of sales mix may be impacted by the inclusion of potential new brands or channels of distribution which have margin and product cost structures different from those of our current mix of business

financial condition 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

overview 

  

our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program borrowings from the issuance of longterm debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks and other lenders in the united states and abroad at june 30 2011 we had cash and cash equivalents of 12530 million compared with 11207 million at june 30 2010 our cash and cash equivalents are maintained at a number of financial institutions as of june 30 2011 less than 25 of our total cash was insured by governmental agencies to mitigate the risk of uninsured balances we select financial institutions based on their credit ratings and financial strength and perform ongoing evaluations of these institutions to limit our concentration risk exposure 

  

our business is seasonal in nature and accordingly our working capital needs vary from time to time we may enter into investing and financing transactions that require additional funding to the extent that these needs exceed cash from operations we could subject to market conditions issue commercial paper issue longterm debt securities or borrow under our revolving credit facilities 

  

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that cash on hand cash generated from operations available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business operations information systems enhancements capital expenditures potential stock repurchases commitments and other contractual obligations on both a nearterm and longterm basis our cash and cash equivalents balance at june 30 2011 includes approximately 508 million of cash in offshore jurisdictions associated with our permanent reinvestment strategy we do not believe that the indefinite reinvestment of these funds offshore impairs our ability to meet our domestic debt or working capital obligations 

  

the effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years generally we have been able to introduce new products at higher prices increase prices and implement other operating efficiencies to sufficiently offset cost increases which have been moderate 

  

  

credit ratings 

  

changes in our credit ratings will likely result in changes in our borrowing costs our credit ratings also impact the cost of our revolving credit facility as discussed below downgrades in our credit ratings may reduce our ability to issue commercial paper andor longterm debt and would likely increase the relative costs of borrowing a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating as of august 15 2011 our commercial paper is rated a1 by standard  poor’s and p1 by moody’s and our longterm debt is rated a with a stable outlook by standard  poor’s and a2 with a stable outlook by moody’s 

  

debt 

  

at june 30 2011 our outstanding borrowings were as follows 

  

 

  

1   consists of 3000 million principal and unamortized debt discount of 36 million

5   consists of 1200 million principal and a 06 million adjustment to reflect the remaining termination value of an interest rate swap that is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt 

6   as of june 30 2011 we were in compliance with all restrictive covenants including limitations on indebtedness and liens and expect continued compliance 

  

we have a 7500 million commercial paper program under which we may issue commercial paper in the united states at june 30 2011 there was no commercial paper outstanding we also have 2054 million in additional uncommitted credit facilities of which 106 million was used as of june 30 2011 we do not anticipate difficulties in securing this form of working capital financing 

  

in july 2011 we replaced our undrawn 7500 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility that was set to expire on april 26 2012 the “prior facility” with a new 10 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on july 14 2015 the “new facility” the new facility may be used to provide credit support for our commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes as with the prior facility up to the equivalent of 250 million of the new facility is available for multicurrency loans the interest rate on borrowings under the new facility is based on libor or on the higher of prime which is the rate of interest publicly announced by the administrative agent or ½ plus the federal funds rate we incurred costs of approximately 12 million to establish the new facility which will be amortized over the term of the facility the new facility has an annual fee of 07 million payable quarterly based on our current credit ratings the new facility also contains a crossdefault provision whereby a failure to pay other material financial obligations in excess of 1000 million after grace periods and absent a waiver from the lenders would result in an event of default and the acceleration of the maturity of any outstanding debt under this facility 

  

  

as of june 30 2011 we were in compliance with all financial and other restrictive covenants relating to the prior facility including limitations on indebtedness and liens and expect continued compliance with similar restrictive covenants in the new facility the financial covenant in the prior facility required an interest expense coverage ratio of greater than 31 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter there is no such covenant under the new facility the interest expense coverage ratio was defined in the prior facility as the ratio of consolidated ebitda which does not represent a measure of our operating results as defined under us generally accepted accounting principles to consolidated interest expense and was calculated as stipulated in the prior facility as follows 

  

   

1   in accordance with the prior facility this period represents the four most recent quarters 

2   includes interest expense net and interest expense on debt extinguishment 

3   excludes amortization of debt discount and derivative and debt issuance costs as they are already included in interest expense net 

4   includes goodwill and other intangible asset impairments and noncash charges associated with restructuring activities 

5   as provided for in the prior facility 

  

we have a fixed rate promissory note agreement with a financial institution pursuant to which we may borrow up to 1500 million in the form of loan participation notes through one of our subsidiaries in europe the interest rate on borrowings under this agreement is at an allin fixed rate determined by the lender and agreed to by us at the date of each borrowing at june 30 2011 no borrowings were outstanding under this agreement debt issuance costs incurred related to this agreement were de minimis 

  

we have an overdraft borrowing agreement with a financial institution pursuant to which our subsidiary in turkey may be credited to satisfy outstanding negative daily balances arising from its business operations the total balance outstanding at any time shall not exceed 400 million turkish lira 246 million at the exchange rate at june 30 2011 the interest rate applicable to each such credit shall be up to a maximum of 175 basis points per annum above the spot rate charged by the lender or the lender’s floating call rate agreed to by us at each borrowing there were no debt issuance costs incurred related to this agreement the outstanding balance at june 30 2011 82 million at the exchange rate at june 30 2011 is classified as shortterm debt in our consolidated balance sheet 

  

we have a 15 billion japanese yen 187 million at the exchange rate at june 30 2011 revolving credit facility that expires on march 31 2012 the interest rate on borrowings under this credit facility is based on tibor tokyo interbank offered rate plus 75 and the facility fees incurred on the undrawn balance is 25 basis points at june 30 2011 no borrowings were outstanding under this facility 

  

total debt as a percent of total capitalization excluding noncontrolling interest decreased to 32 at june 30 2011 from 39 at june 30 2010 primarily as a result of the an increase in stockholders’ equity driven by higher net earnings during fiscal 2011 

  

  

cash flows 

  

net cash provided by operating activities was 10270 million 9567 million and 6960 million in fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively cash flows from operating activities increased in fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010 primarily reflecting the increase in net earnings and the timing and level of accrued income taxes this increase was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable balances due to timing of collections as well as lower levels of accounts payable due to timing of payments and an increase in inventory in line with forecasted sales activity and to ensure acceptable levels of service the increase in operating cash flows in fiscal 2010 as compared with fiscal 2009 primarily reflected higher net earnings an increase in accounts payable due to the timing of payments and to a lesser extent a decrease in accounts receivable this increase also reflected higher accrued employee compensation and advertising merchandising and sampling partially offset by higher cash paid in fiscal 2010 for restructuring and severance these changes were partially offset by the building of safety stock for the april 2010 implementation of sap at our north american manufacturing plants the fiscal 2009 impact of significant inventory reductions and higher discretionary pension contributions approximately 60 million of the change in deferred income taxes was offset by a correlative change in noncurrent accrued income taxes reflecting the balance sheet presentation of unrecognized tax benefits 

  

net cash used for investing activities was 6069 million 2814 million and 3395 million in fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the increase in cash flows used for investing activities as compared with fiscal 2010 primarily reflected the july 2010 acquisition of smashbox beauty cosmetics as well as higher cash payments for counters and computer hardware and software the decrease in investing cash outflows during fiscal 2010 as compared with fiscal 2009 primarily reflected lower acquisition activity in fiscal 2010 as compared with the acquisitions of applied genetics incorporated dermatics and businesses engaged in the wholesale distribution and retail sale of aveda products in fiscal 2009 the change also reflected lower cash payments in fiscal 2010 related to counters and leasehold improvements 

  

net cash used for financing activities was 3131 million and 4061 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively and net cash provided by financing activities was 1258 million in fiscal 2009 the decrease in net cash flows used for financing activities reflected a favorable comparison with fiscal 2010 which included the partial redemption of the 2012 and 2013 senior notes this favorable comparison was offset by an increase in treasury stock purchases and an increase in the common stock dividends during fiscal 2011 subsequent to june 30 2011 we purchased approximately 28 million additional shares of class a common stock for 2801 million pursuant to our share repurchase program the change in net cash flows used for financing activities in fiscal 2010 as compared with net cash flows provided by financing activities in fiscal 2009 was primarily driven by the fiscal 2009 net proceeds from the issuance of the 2013 senior notes and the fiscal 2010 partial redemption of the 2012 and 2013 senior notes also contributing to this change was an increase in treasury stock purchases and repayments related to ojon promissory notes partially offset by higher cash inflows from stock option exercises and the fiscal 2009 repayment of commercial paper borrowings 

  

dividends 

  

on november 9 2010 the board of directors declared an annual dividend of 75 per share on our class a and class b common stock of which an aggregate of 1480 million was paid on december 15 2010 to stockholders of record at the close of business on november 29 2010 the annual common stock dividend declared during fiscal 2010 was 55 per share of which an aggregate of 1091 million was paid on december 16 2009 to stockholders of record at the close of business on november 30 2009 

  

pension and postretirement plan funding 

  

several factors influence the annual funding requirements for our pension plans for the us qualified plan our funding policy consists of annual contributions at a rate that provides for future plan benefits and maintains appropriate funded percentages such contribution is not less than the minimum required by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended “erisa” and subsequent pension legislation and is not more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes for each international plan our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations in addition amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions as detailed in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — critical accounting policies and estimates ” the effect of our pension plan funding on future operating results will depend on economic conditions employee demographics mortality rates the number of participants electing to take lumpsum distributions investment performance and funding decisions 

  

for the us qualified plan we maintain an investment strategy of matching the duration of a substantial portion of the plan assets with the duration of the underlying plan liabilities this strategy assisted in maintaining a funded ratio of more than 100 as of june 30 2011 for fiscal 2011 and 2010 we met or exceeded all minimum contributions required by erisa for the us qualified plan nevertheless we made discretionary cash contributions totaling 356 million and 390 million to the us qualified plan during fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively we made discretionary cash contributions to our postretirement plan in the united states of 84 million and 60 million during fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively at this time we do not expect to make cash contributions to the us qualified plan or our postretirement plan in the united states during fiscal 2012 however as we continue to monitor the performance of our plan assets we may decide to make discretionary contributions 

  

  

for fiscal 2011 and 2010 we made benefit payments under our nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan of 88 million and 77 million respectively we expect to make benefit payments under this plan during fiscal 2012 of approximately 10 million for fiscal 2011 and 2010 we made cash contributions to our international defined benefit pension plans of 341 million and 682 million respectively we expect to make contributions under these plans during fiscal 2012 of approximately 16 million 

  

commitments and contingencies 

  

certain of our business acquisition agreements include “earnout” provisions these provisions generally require that we pay to the seller or sellers of the business additional amounts based on the performance of the acquired business since the size of each payment depends upon performance of the acquired business we do not expect that such payments will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or financial condition 

  

for additional contingencies refer to “item 3 legal proceedings” 

  

contractual obligations 

  

the following table summarizes scheduled maturities of our contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed and determinable as of june 30 2011 

  

   

1   includes longterm and shortterm debt and the related projected interest costs and to a lesser extent capital lease commitments interest costs on longterm and shortterm debt are projected to be 715 million in fiscal 2012 643 million in fiscal 2013 551 million in fiscal 2014 462 million in fiscal 2015 462 million in fiscal 2016 and 5959 million thereafter projected interest costs on variable rate instruments were calculated using market rates at june 30 2011 refer to “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data — note 10 — debt ” 

2   minimum operating lease commitments only include base rent certain leases provide for contingent rents that are not measurable at inception and primarily include rents based on a percentage of sales in excess of stipulated levels as well as common area maintenance these amounts are excluded from minimum operating lease commitments and are included in the determination of total rent expense when it is probable that the expense has been incurred and the amount is reasonably measurable 

3   unconditional purchase obligations primarily include inventory commitments estimated future earnout payments estimated royalty payments pursuant to license agreements advertising commitments capital improvement commitments planned funding of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations commitments pursuant to executive compensation arrangements obligations related to our cost savings initiatives and acquisitions future earnout payments and future royalty and advertising commitments were estimated based on planned future sales for the term that was in effect at june 30 2011 without consideration for potential renewal periods 

4   refer to “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data — note 8 — income taxes” for information regarding unrecognized tax benefits as of june 30 2011 the noncurrent portion of our unrecognized tax benefits including related accrued interest and penalties was 1295 million at this time the settlement period for the noncurrent portion of the unrecognized tax benefits including related accrued interest and penalties cannot be determined and therefore was not included 

  

derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 

  

we address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments we enter into foreign currency forward and may enter into option contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates and interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on our aggregate liability portfolio we also enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes costs associated with entering into these derivative financial instruments have not been material to our consolidated financial results 

  

  

for each derivative contract entered into where we look to obtain special hedge accounting treatment we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items as well as our riskmanagement objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction the nature of the risk being hedged how the hedging instruments’ effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively and a description of the method of measuring ineffectiveness this process includes linking all derivatives to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions we also formally assess both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items if it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge we will be required to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively 

  

foreign exchange risk management 

  

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge anticipated transactions as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies for periods consistent with our identified exposures the purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on costs and on the cash flows that we receive from foreign subsidiaries the majority of foreign currency forward contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries we may also enter into foreign currency option contracts to hedge anticipated transactions the foreign currency forward contracts entered into to hedge anticipated transactions have been designated as foreign currency cashflow hedges and have varying maturities through the end of march 2013 hedge effectiveness of foreign currency forward contracts is based on a hypothetical derivative methodology and excludes the portion of fair value attributable to the spotforward difference which is recorded in currentperiod earnings hedge effectiveness of foreign currency option contracts is based on a dollar offset methodology the ineffective portion of both foreign currency forward and option contracts is recorded in currentperiod earnings for hedge contracts that are no longer deemed highly effective hedge accounting is discontinued and gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income loss are reclassified to earnings when the underlying forecasted transaction occurs if it is probable that the forecasted transaction will no longer occur then any gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income loss are reclassified to currentperiod earnings as of june 30 2011 these foreign currency cashflow hedges were highly effective in all material respects 

  

at june 30 2011 the company had foreign currency forward contracts in the amount of 14907 million the foreign currencies included in foreign currency forward contracts notional value stated in us dollars are principally the swiss franc 2849 million british pound 2735 million canadian dollar 2101 million euro 1646 million australian dollar 1107 million korean won 779 million and russian ruble 452 million 

  

interest rate risk management 

  

we enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the exposure to interest rate fluctuations on our funded indebtedness and anticipated issuance of debt for periods consistent with the identified exposures during fiscal 2011 we terminated our interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount totaling 2500 million which had effectively converted the fixed rate interest on our outstanding 2017 senior notes to variable interest rates the instrument which was classified as an asset had a fair value of 474 million at the date of cash settlement hedge accounting treatment was discontinued prospectively and the fair value adjustment to the carrying amount of the related debt is being amortized against interest expense over the remaining life of the debt 

  

credit risk 

  

as a matter of policy we only enter into derivative contracts with counterparties that have at least an “a” or equivalent credit rating the counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions exposure to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to the gross fair value of contracts in asset positions which totaled 150 million at june 30 2011 to manage this risk we have established counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored and reported to management accordingly management believes risk of loss under these hedging contracts is remote 

  

certain of our derivative financial instruments contain creditriskrelated contingent features as of june 30 2011 we were in a net liability position for certain derivative contracts that contain such features with two counterparties the fair value of those contracts as of june 30 2011 was approximately 34 million and we were in compliance with such creditriskrelated contingent features 

  

  

market risk 

  

we use a valueatrisk model to assess the market risk of our derivative financial instruments valueatrisk represents the potential losses for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors for a specified time period and confidence level we estimate valueatrisk across all of our derivative financial instruments using a model with historical volatilities and correlations calculated over the past 250day period the high low and average measured valueatrisk during fiscal 2011 related to our foreign exchange contracts is as follows 

  

   

the model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 percent confidence level we used a statistical simulation model that valued our derivative financial instruments against one thousand randomly generated market price paths our calculated valueatrisk exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may or may not occur it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated based upon actual fluctuations in market rates operating exposures and the timing thereof and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year 

  

we believe however that any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the derivative financial instrument was intended 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

we do not maintain any offbalance sheet arrangements transactions obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations 

  

recently issued accounting standards 

  

refer to “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data — note 2 — summary of significant accounting policies” for discussion regarding the impact of accounting standards that were recently issued but not yet effective on our consolidated financial statements

information systems 

  

information systems support business processes including product development marketing sales order processing production distribution and finance of the many systems currently being utilized the most significant to our business needs are i a centralized data repository of essential attributes for each of the products we offer or plan to offer which enables us to globally manufacture and market products of consistent quality ii a sales analysis system to track weekly sales at the stock keeping unit “sku” level at most significant retail sales locations ie sellthrough data increasing our understanding of consumer preferences and enabling us to coordinate more effectively our product development manufacturing and marketing strategies iii an automated replenishment system with many of our key domestic customers allowing us to replenish inventories for individual points of sale automatically with minimal paperwork and iv an inventory management system to provide us with a global view of finished goods availability relative to actual requirements 

  

we expect that these systems will continue to provide pertinent inventory and sales data in the short term however as part of our longterm effort to enhance these systems and increase productivity we are implementing our strategic modernization initiative “smi” which includes an enterprisewide global program that we expect will deliver a single set of integrated data processes and technologies which would be scalable and used to standardize business processes across brands operating units and sales affiliates as part of smi we anticipate the continued migration of our operations to sap with the majority of our locations being implemented through fiscal 2012

 item 1a risk factors 

  

there are risks associated with an investment in our securities 

  

please consider the following risks and all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k and in our subsequent filings with the securities and exchange commission “sec” our business may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial if any of the events contemplated by the following discussion of risks should occur or other risks arise or develop our business prospects financial condition and results of operations as well as the trading prices of our securities may be adversely affected 

  

the beauty business is highly competitive and if we are unable to compete effectively our results will suffer 

  

we face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world including multinational consumer product companies some of these competitors have greater resources than we do and may be able to respond to changing business and economic conditions more quickly than us competition in the beauty business is based on pricing of products innovation perceived value service to the consumer promotional activities advertising special events new product introductions ecommerce and mobilecommerce initiatives and other activities it is difficult for us to predict the timing and scale of our competitors’ actions in these areas in particular the fragrance category in the united states has in the past been influenced by the high volume of new product introductions by diverse companies across several different distribution channels also the trend toward consolidation in the retail trade particularly in developed markets such as the united states and western europe has resulted in us becoming increasingly dependent on key retailers including largeformat retailers who have increased their bargaining strength this trend has also resulted in an increased risk related to the concentration of our customers a severe adverse impact on their business operations could have a corresponding material adverse effect on us our ability to compete also depends on the continued strength of our brands our ability to attract and retain key talent and other personnel the efficiency of our manufacturing facilities and distribution network and our ability to protect our intellectual property our inability to continue to compete effectively in countries around the world could have an adverse impact on our business 

  

our inability to anticipate and respond to market trends and changes in consumer preferences could adversely affect our financial results 

  

our continued success depends on our ability to anticipate gauge and react in a timely and costeffective manner to changes in consumer tastes for skin care makeup fragrance and hair care products their attitudes toward our industry and brands as well as to where and how consumers shop for those products we must continually work to develop produce and market new products maintain and enhance the recognition of our brands achieve a favorable mix of products and refine our approach as to how and where we market and sell our products while we devote considerable effort and resources to shape analyze and respond to consumer preferences we recognize that consumer tastes cannot be predicted with certainty and can change rapidly the issue is compounded by the increasing use of social and digital media by consumers and the speed by which information and opinions are shared if we are unable to anticipate and respond to sudden challenges that we may face in the marketplace trends in the market for our products and changing consumer demands and sentiment our financial results will suffer 

  

our future success depends on our ability to achieve our longterm strategy 

  

achieving our longterm objectives will require investment in new capabilities brands categories distribution channels technologies and geographic markets these investments may result in shortterm costs without any current revenues and therefore may be dilutive to our earnings at least in the short term in addition we may dispose of or discontinue select brands or streamline operations and incur costs or special charges in doing so although we believe that our strategy will lead to longterm growth in revenue and profitability we may not realize in full or in part the anticipated benefits the failure to realize benefits which may be due to our inability to execute plans global economic conditions competition changes in the beauty industry and the other risks described herein could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

  

acquisitions may expose us to additional risks 

  

we continuously review acquisition opportunities that would expand our current product offerings our distribution channels increase the size and geographic scope of our operations or otherwise offer growth and operating efficiency opportunities if required the financing for any of these acquisitions could result in an increase in our indebtedness dilute the interests of our stockholders or both acquisitions may entail numerous risks including 

  

·   difficulties in assimilating acquired operations or products including the loss of key employees from or customers of acquired businesses 

·   diversion of management’s attention from our core businesses 

·   adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and 

·   risks of entering distribution channels categories or markets in which we have limited or no prior experience 

  

our failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate acquisitions on favorable terms 

  

we are required at least annually or as facts and circumstances warrant to test goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to determine if impairment has occurred if the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the fair value of other intangible assets with indefinite lives in the period the determination is made we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired there will be an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

a general economic downturn or sudden disruption in business conditions may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items andor the financial strength of our customers that are retailers which could adversely affect our financial results 

  

the general level of consumer spending is affected by a number of factors including general economic conditions inflation interest rates energy costs and consumer confidence generally all of which are beyond our control consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower and may impact sales of our products a decline in consumer purchases of discretionary items also tends to impact our customers that are retailers we generally extend credit to a retailer based on an evaluation of its financial condition usually without requiring collateral however the financial difficulties of a retailer could cause us to curtail or eliminate business with that customer we may also assume more credit risk relating to the receivables from that retailer our inability to collect the receivable from one of our largest customers or from a group of customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition if a retailer was to liquidate we may incur additional costs if we choose to purchase the retailer’s inventory of our products to protect brand equity 

  

in addition sudden disruptions in business conditions for example as a consequence of events such as a pandemic or those that are currently taking place in the middle east or as a result of a terrorist attack retaliation and the threat of further attacks or retaliation or as a result of adverse weather conditions or climate changes can have a short and sometimes longterm impact on consumer spending 

  

events that impact consumers’ willingness or ability to travel andor purchase our products while traveling may impact our travel retail business which is a significant contributor to our overall results 

  

a downturn in the economies in which we sell our products or a sudden disruption of business conditions in those economies could adversely affect our sales and profitability 

  

volatility in the financial markets and a related economic downturn in key markets or markets generally throughout the world could have a material adverse effect on our business while we currently generate significant cash flows from our ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities credit markets may experience significant disruptions deterioration in global financial markets could make future financing difficult or more expensive if any financial institutions that are parties to our undrawn revolving credit facility supporting our commercial paper program or other financing arrangements such as interest rate or foreign exchange hedging instruments were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us this could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain interest rate or foreign currency exposures which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

  

changes in laws regulations and policies that affect our business could adversely affect our financial results 

  

our business is subject to numerous laws regulations and policies changes in the laws regulations and policies including the interpretation or enforcement thereof that affect or will affect our business including changes in accounting standards tax laws and regulations environmental or climate change laws regulations or accords trade rules and customs regulations and the outcome and expense of legal or regulatory proceedings and any action we may take as a result could adversely affect our financial results 

  

our success depends in part on the quality and safety of our products 

  

our success depends in part on the quality and safety of our products if our products are found to be defective or unsafe or if they otherwise fail to meet our consumers’ standards our relationships with customers or consumers could suffer the appeal of one or more of our brands could be diminished and we could lose sales andor become subject to liability claims any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

our success depends in part on our key personnel 

  

our success depends in part on our ability to retain our key personnel including our executive officers and senior management team the unexpected loss of one or more of our key employees could adversely affect our business our success also depends in part on our continuing ability to identify hire train and retain other highly qualified personnel competition for these employees can be intense we may not be able to attract assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business this risk may be exacerbated by the stresses associated with the implementation of our strategic plan and other initiatives 

  

we are subject to risks related to our international operations 

  

we operate on a global basis with approximately 62 of our fiscal 2010 net sales generated outside the united states we maintain offices in over 40 countries and have key operational facilities located outside the united states that manufacture warehouse or distribute goods for sale throughout the world foreign operations are subject to many risks and uncertainties including 

  

·   fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which can affect our results of operations the value of our foreign assets the relative prices at which we and foreign competitors sell products in the same markets and the cost of certain inventory and noninventory items required in our operations 

·   changes in foreign laws regulations and policies including restrictions on trade import and export license requirements and tariffs and taxes as well as changes in united states laws and regulations relating to foreign trade and investment and 

·   adverse weather conditions social economic and geopolitical conditions such as terrorist attacks war or other military action 

  

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects results of operations and financial condition 

  

a disruption in operations could adversely affect our business and financial results 

  

as a company engaged in manufacturing and distribution on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including industrial accidents environmental events strikes and other labor disputes disruptions in supply chain or information systems loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites product quality control safety licensing requirements and other regulatory issues as well as natural disasters and other external factors over which we have no control if such an event were to occur it could have an adverse affect on our business and financial results 

  

our information systems and websites may be susceptible to outages and other risks 

  

we have information systems that support our business processes including product development marketing sales order processing production distribution finance and intracompany communications throughout the world we have ecommerce and other internet websites in the united states and many other countries these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire floods power loss telecommunications failures breakins and similar events despite the implementation of network security measures our systems may be vulnerable to computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering the occurrence of these or other events could disrupt or damage our information systems and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

  

we are subject to risks associated with implementing global information systems 

  

as part of smi we are implementing enterprisewide global programs intended to deliver a single set of integrated data processes and technologies which would be scalable and used to standardize business processes across brands operating units and sales affiliates we anticipate the continued migration of our operations to sap with the majority of our locations to be implemented through fiscal 2012 like most entitywide changes to software systems the implementation of smi involves risks and uncertainties failure to implement smi as planned in terms of timing specifications andor costs could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

  

the trading prices of our securities periodically may rise or fall based on the accuracy of predictions of our earnings or other financial performance 

  

our business planning process is designed to maximize our longterm strength growth and profitability not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter we believe that this longerterm focus is in the best interests of the company and our stockholders at the same time however we recognize that it may be helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our forecast of net sales and earnings per share accordingly when we announced our yearend financial results for fiscal 2010 we provided guidance as to our expected net sales and earnings per share for the fiscal year ending june 30 2011 and the quarter ending september 30 2010 while we generally expect to provide updates to our guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter we assume no responsibility to update any of our forwardlooking statements at such times or otherwise in addition the longerterm guidance we provide is based on goals that we believe at the time guidance is given are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years such targets are more difficult to predict than our current quarter and fiscal year expectations 

  

in all of our public statements when we make or update a forwardlooking statement about our sales andor earnings expectations or expectations regarding restructuring or other initiatives we accompany such statements directly or by reference to a public document with a list of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we expect such a list is included among other places in our earnings press release and in our periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission eg in our reports on form 10k and form 10q these and other factors may make it difficult for outside observers such as research analysts to predict what our earnings will be in any given fiscal quarter or year 

  

outside analysts and investors have the right to make their own predictions of our financial results for any future period outside analysts however have access to no more material information about our results or plans than any other public investor and we do not endorse their predictions as to our future performance nor do we assume any responsibility to correct the predictions of outside analysts or others when they differ from our own internal expectations if and when we announce actual results that differ from those that outside analysts or others have been predicting the market price of our securities could be affected investors who rely on the predictions of outside analysts or others when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk we take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in the prices of our securities 

  

failure to adequately maintain the security of our electronic and other confidential information could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

  

we are dependent upon automated information technology processes as part of our normal business activities we collect and store certain confidential information including personal information with respect to customers and employees we may share some of this information with vendors who assist us with certain aspects of our business moreover the success of our ecommerce operations depends upon the secure transmission of confidential and personal data over public networks including the use of cashless payments any failure on the part of us or our vendors to maintain the security of our confidential data and our employees’ and customers’ personal information including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information could result in business disruption damage to our reputation financial obligations to third parties fines penalties regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs and also result in deterioration in our employees’ and customers’ confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages and thus could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to enhance our information security systems and could result in a disruption to our operations 

  

as we outsource more functions we will become more dependent on the entities performing those functions 

  

as part of our longterm strategy we are continually looking for opportunities to provide essential business services in a more costeffective manner in some cases this requires the outsourcing of functions or parts of functions that can be performed more effectively by external service providers these include certain information systems functions such as information technology operations and certain human resource functions such as employee benefit plan administration while we believe we conduct appropriate due diligence before entering into agreements with the outsourcing entity the failure of one or more entities to provide the expected services provide them on a timely basis or to provide them at the prices we expect may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

  

  

we are controlled by the lauder family as a result of their control of us the lauder family has the ability to prevent or cause a change in control or approve prevent or influence certain actions by us 

  

as of august 13 2010 members of the lauder family beneficially own directly or indirectly shares of class a common stock with one vote per share and class b common stock with 10 votes per share having approximately 871 of the outstanding voting power of the common stock in addition there are six members of the lauder family who are employees including four who are members of our board of directors as a result of the stock ownership and their positions at the company the lauder family has the ability to exercise significant control and influence over our business including without limitation all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors amendments to the certificate of incorporation and significant corporate transactions such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets for the foreseeable future 

  

we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the new york stock exchange rules and as a result are relying on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that are designed to provide protection to stockholders of companies that are not “controlled companies” 

  

the lauder family and their related entities own more than 50 of the total voting power of our common shares and as a result we are a “controlled company” under the new york stock exchange corporate governance standards as a controlled company we are exempt under the new york stock exchange standards from the obligation to comply with certain new york stock exchange corporate governance requirements including the requirements 

  

·   that a majority of our board of directors consists of independent directors 

·   that we have a nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities and 

·   that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities 

  

while we have voluntarily caused our board to have a majority of independent directors and the written charters of our nominating and board affairs committee and the compensation committee to have the required provisions we are not requiring our nominating and board affairs committee and compensation committee to be comprised solely of independent directors as a result of our use of the “controlled company” exemptions investors will not have the same protection afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the new york stock exchange corporate governance requirements

 item 3 legal proceedings  

  

we are involved from time to time in litigation and other legal proceedings incidental to our business management believes that the outcome of current litigation and legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial condition however management’s assessment of our current litigation and other legal proceedings could change in light of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions or other proceedings pending against us not presently known to us or determinations by judges juries or other finders of fact which are not in accord with management’s evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such litigation or proceedings

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition at june 30 2010 and our results of operations for the three fiscal years ended june 30 2010 are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements these estimates and assumptions can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition inventory pension and other postretirement benefit costs goodwill other intangible assets and longlived assets income taxes and derivatives 

  

management of the company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of the company’s board of directors 

  

revenue recognition 

  

revenues from merchandise sales are recognized upon transfer of ownership including passage of title to the customer and transfer of the risk of loss related to those goods in the americas region sales are generally recognized at the time the product is shipped to the customer and in the europe middle east  africa and asiapacific regions sales are generally recognized based upon the customer’s receipt in certain circumstances transfer of title takes place at the point of sale for example at our retail stores sales at our retail stores and online are recognized in accordance with a traditional 445 retail calendar where each fiscal quarter is comprised of two 4week periods and one 5week period with one extra week in one quarter every seven years as a result the retail quarterend and the fiscal quarterend may be different by up to six days 

  

revenues are reported on a net sales basis which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual product returns received discounts incentive arrangements with retailers and an amount established for anticipated product returns our practice is to accept product returns from retailers only if properly requested authorized and approved in accepting returns we typically provide a credit to the retailer against accounts receivable from that retailer as a percentage of gross sales returns were 43 44 and 44 in fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

  

  

our sales return accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net sales this accrual is calculated based on a history of actual returns estimated future returns and information provided by retailers regarding their inventory levels consideration of these factors results in an accrual for anticipated sales returns that reflects increases or decreases related to seasonal fluctuations experience has shown a relationship between retailer inventory levels and sales returns in the subsequent period as well as a consistent pattern of returns due to the seasonal nature of our business in addition as necessary specific accruals may be established for significant future known or anticipated events the types of known or anticipated events that we have considered and will continue to consider include but are not limited to the financial condition of our customers store closings by retailers changes in the retail environment and our decision to continue or support new and existing products 

  

in the ordinary course of business we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions based upon the evaluation of accounts receivable aging specific exposures and historical trends our allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net earnings the allowance for doubtful accounts was 343 million and 414 million as of june 30 2010 and 2009 respectively the allowance for doubtful accounts was reduced by 158 million 141 million and 102 million for customer deductions and writeoffs in fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively and increased by 87 million 292 million and 132 million for additional provisions in fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

  

inventory 

  

we state our inventory at the lower of cost or fair market value with cost being determined on the firstin firstout fifo method we believe fifo most closely matches the flow of our products from manufacture through sale the reported net value of our inventory includes saleable products promotional products raw materials and componentry and work in process that will be sold or used in future periods inventory cost includes raw materials direct labor and overhead as well as inbound freight manufacturing overhead is allocated to the cost of inventory based on the normal production capacity unallocated overhead during periods of abnormally low production levels are recognized as cost of sales in the period in which they are incurred 

  

we also record an inventory obsolescence reserve which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated realizable value based on various product sales projections this reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales in addition and as necessary we may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events 

  

pension and other postretirement benefit costs 

  

we offer the following benefits to some or all of our employees a domestic trustbased noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan “us qualified plan” and an unfunded nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations collectively with the us qualified plan the “domestic plans” a domestic contributory defined contribution plan international pension plans which vary by country consisting of both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans deferred compensation arrangements and certain other postretirement benefit plans 

  

the amounts needed to fund future payouts under these plans are subject to numerous assumptions and variables certain significant variables require us to make assumptions that are within our control such as an anticipated discount rate expected rate of return on plan assets and future compensation levels we evaluate these assumptions with our actuarial advisors and select assumptions that we believe reflect the economics underlying our pension and postretirement obligations while we believe these assumptions are within accepted industry ranges an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a direct impact on reported net earnings 

  

the discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated longterm bonds for fiscal 2010 we used a discount rate for our domestic plans of 650 and varying rates on our international plans of between 175 and 875 the discount rate for our domestic plans is based on a bond portfolio that includes only longterm bonds with an aa rating or equivalent from a major rating agency we believe the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio is expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of our domestic plans for fiscal 2010 we used an expected return on plan assets of 775 for our us qualified plan and varying rates of between 275 and 875 for our international plans in determining the longterm rate of return for a plan we consider the historical rates of return the nature of the plan’s investments and an expectation for the plan’s investment strategies see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data — note 13 — pension deferred compensation and postretirement benefit plans ” for details regarding the nature of our pension and postretirement plan investments the difference between actual and expected return on plan assets is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income those gainslosses that are subject to amortization over future periods will be recognized as a component of the net periodic benefit cost in such future periods for fiscal 2010 our pension plans had actual return on assets of approximately 101 million as compared with expected return on assets of approximately 52 million which resulted in a net deferred gain of approximately 49 million substantially all of which is currently subject to be amortized over periods ranging from approximately 4 to 26 years the actual return on assets was primarily related to the performance of equity markets during the past fiscal year 

  

  

a 25 basispoint change in the discount rate or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have had the following effect on fiscal 2010 pension expense 

  

   

our postretirement plans are comprised of health care plans that could be impacted by health care cost trend rates which may have a significant effect on the amounts reported a onepercentagepoint change in assumed health care cost trend rates for fiscal 2010 would have had the following effects 

  

   

for fiscal 2011 we are using a discount rate for the domestic plans of 530 and varying rates for our international plans of between 125 and 800 we are using an expected return on plan assets of 775 for the us qualified plan and varying rates for our international pension plans of between 250 and 800 the net change in these assumptions from those used in fiscal 2010 will result in an increase in pension expense of approximately 114 million in fiscal 2011 we will continue to monitor the market conditions relative to these assumptions and adjust them accordingly 

  

goodwill other intangible assets and longlived assets 

  

goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets other indefinitelived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized 

  

we assess goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles at least annually for impairment as of the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if certain events or circumstances warrant we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which is one level below our operating segments we identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and management of each reporting unit regularly reviews the operating results of those components we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to determine carrying values for our reporting units impairment testing is performed in two steps i we determine impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value and ii if there is an impairment we measure the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill the impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets encompasses calculating a fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value if the carrying value exceeds the fair value impairment is recorded 

  

testing goodwill for impairment requires us to estimate fair values of reporting units using significant estimates and assumptions the assumptions made will impact the outcome and ultimate results of the testing we use industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and in certain instances we engage thirdparty valuation specialists to advise us to determine fair value of the reporting unit we generally use an equal weighting of the income and market approaches in certain circumstances equal weighting will not be applied if one of these methods may be less applicable eg only the income approach would be used for reporting units with existing negative margins we believe both approaches are equally relevant and the most reliable indications of fair value because the fair value of product or service companies is more dependent on the ability to generate earnings than on the value of the assets used in the production process 

  

under the income approach we determine fair value using a discounted cash flow method projecting future cash flows of each reporting unit as well as terminal value and discounting such cash flows at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows 

  

under the market approach we utilize information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units which creates valuation multiples that are applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested to value the reporting unit 

  

  

the key estimates and factors used in these two approaches include but are not limited to revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts terminal value the weightedaverage cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and comparable market multiples the fiscal 2010 compound annual growth rate of sales for the first four to eight years of our projections as considered appropriate for the individual reporting units ranged between 3 and 24 with the higher growth rates in those reporting units that start with the smallest base in fiscal 2010 the fiscal 2009 compound annual growth rate of sales for the first eight years of our projections ranged between 6 and 19 with the higher growth rates in those reporting units that start with the smallest base in fiscal 2009 for reporting units with positive earnings growth in the corresponding earnings before interest and taxes ranged from 9 to 161 in fiscal 2010 as compared with 6 to 46 in fiscal 2009 the terminal growth rates were projected at 3 after four to eight years in fiscal 2010 as compared with 3 after eight years in fiscal 2009 which reflects our estimate of long term market and gross domestic product growth the weightedaverage cost of capital used to discount future cash flows ranged from 9 to 17 in fiscal 2010 as compared with 11 to 17 in fiscal 2009 the range of market multiples used in our fiscal 2010 impairment testing was from 05 to 3 times trailingtwelvemonth sales and 9 to 12 times trailingtwelvemonth earnings before interest taxes and depreciation and amortization the range of market multiples used in our fiscal 2009 impairment testing was from 2 to 3 times trailingtwelvemonth sales and 10 times trailingtwelvemonth earnings before interest taxes and depreciation and amortization future changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the results of our reviews for impairment of goodwill however a decrease of 30 basis points in our terminal growth rate or an increase of 30 basis points in our weightedaverage cost of capital would still result in a fair value calculation exceeding our book value for each of our reporting units except for the ojon reporting unit see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — goodwill other intangible assets and longlived assets”   changes in the valuation assumptions from those used in the prior year primarily reflect the impact of the current economic environment on the reporting units and their projected future results of operations 

  

to determine fair value of other indefinitelived intangible assets we use an income approach the relieffromroyalty method this method assumes that in lieu of ownership a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to obtain the rights to use the comparable asset other indefinitelived intangible assets’ fair values require significant judgments in determining both the assets’ estimated cash flows as well as the appropriate discount and royalty rates applied to those cash flows to determine fair value changes in such estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results 

  

we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable when such events or changes in circumstances occur a recoverability test is performed comparing projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset or asset group to its carrying value if the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value an impairment would be recorded for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value which is determined by discounting future cash flows 

  

income taxes 

  

we account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns as of june 30 2010 we have current net deferred tax assets of 2690 million and noncurrent net deferred tax assets of 1048 million the net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization as well as the continued application of currently anticipated tax rates included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance of 385 million for deferred tax assets where management believes it is morelikelythannot that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the relevant jurisdiction based on our assessments no additional valuation allowance is required if we determine that a deferred tax asset will not be realizable an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will result in a reduction of net earnings at that time 

  

we provide tax reserves for federal state local and international exposures relating to periods subject to audit the development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues potential outcomes and timing and is a subjective critical estimate we assess our tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting dates for those tax positions where it is morelikelythannot that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those tax positions where it is not morelikelythannot that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements we classify applicable interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes although the outcome relating to these exposures is uncertain in management’s opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating from these exposures in certain circumstances the ultimate outcome of exposures and risks involves significant uncertainties which render them inestimable if actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates they could have a material impact on our results of operations 

  

  

derivatives 

  

we address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments we primarily enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates and interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on our aggregate liability portfolio we also enter into foreign currency forward contracts and may use option contracts not designated as hedging instruments to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes hedge effectiveness is documented assessed and monitored by employees who are qualified to make such assessments and monitor the instruments variables that are external to us such as social political and economic risks may have an impact on our hedging program and the results thereof 

  

our derivative financial instruments are recorded as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measured at fair value all derivatives outstanding as of june 30 2010 are i designated as a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment “fairvalue” hedge ii designated as a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability “foreign currency cashflow” hedge or iii not designated as a hedging instrument changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a fairvalue hedge that is highly effective are recorded in currentperiod earnings along with the loss or gain on the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk including losses or gains on unrecognized firm commitments changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a foreign currency cashflow hedge of a foreigncurrencydenominated forecasted transaction that is highly effective are recorded in other comprehensive income loss “oci” gains and losses deferred in oci are then recognized in currentperiod earnings when earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged foreigncurrencydenominated forecasted transaction eg when periodic settlements on a variablerate asset or liability are recorded in earnings changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are reported in currentperiod earnings

quantitative analysis 

  

during the threeyear period ended june 30 2010 there have not been material changes in the assumptions underlying these critical accounting policies nor to the related significant estimates the results of our business underlying these assumptions have not differed significantly from our expectations 

  

while we believe that the estimates that we have made are proper and the related results of operations for the period are presented fairly in all material respects other assumptions could reasonably be justified that would change the amount of reported net sales cost of sales operating expenses or our provision for income taxes as they relate to the provisions for anticipated sales returns allowance for doubtful accounts inventory obsolescence reserve and income taxes for fiscal 2010 had these estimates been changed simultaneously by 25 in either direction our reported gross profit would have increased or decreased by approximately 48 million operating expenses would have changed by approximately 09 million and the provision for income taxes would have increased or decreased by approximately 13 million the collective impact of these changes on operating income net earnings attributable to the estée lauder companies inc and net earnings attributable to the estée lauder companies inc per diluted common share would be an increase or decrease of approximately 57 million 70 million and 03 respectively 

  

  

results of operations 

  

we manufacture market and sell beauty products including those in the skin care makeup fragrance and hair care categories which are distributed in over 150 countries and territories the following table is a comparative summary of operating results from continuing operations for fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 and reflects the basis of presentation described in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data — note 2 — summary of significant accounting policies and note 20 — segment data and related information ” for all periods presented products and services that do not meet our definition of skin care makeup fragrance and hair care have been included in the “other” category 

  

   

  

the following table presents certain consolidated earnings data as a percentage of net sales 

  

   

in order to meet the demands of consumers we continually introduce new products support new and established products through advertising sampling and merchandising and phase out existing products that no longer meet the needs of our consumers the economics of developing producing launching and supporting products influence our sales and operating performance each period the introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products which we take into account in our business planning 

  

we operate on a global basis with the majority of our net sales generated outside the united states accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our results of operations therefore we present certain net sales information excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations to provide a framework for assessing the performance of our underlying business outside the united states constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant periodoverperiod we calculate constant currency information by translating currentperiod results using prioryear period weighted average foreign currency exchange rates 

  

overview 

  

we believe that the best way to increase stockholder value is to provide our customers and consumers with the products and services that they have come to expect from us in the most efficient and profitable manner while recognizing their changing shopping habits to achieve our goal to be the global leader in prestige beauty we are implementing a longterm strategy to guide the company through fiscal 2013 the plan has numerous initiatives across regions product categories brands and functions that are designed to leverage our strengths make us more cost efficient and grow our sales 

  

as part of our strategy we plan to shift our category mix towards higher margin categories with greater global growth potential skin care our most profitable category is a strategic priority for our innovation and investment spending particularly in the asiapacific region we also plan to strengthen our geographic presence by seeking share growth in large imagebuilding cities within core markets such as the united states the united kingdom france italy and japan in addition we will continue to prioritize efforts to expand our presence and accelerate share growth in emerging markets such as china russia the middle east and eastern europe while we expect the retail environment in north america to continue to be challenging we recognize the need to restore profitable growth in our traditional department store channel we have implemented changes to reshape our organization to meet the needs of the changing retail landscape internationally we plan to achieve profitable growth in european perfumeries and pharmacies and in department stores in asia while accentuating our makeup and skin care initiatives to boost our travel retail business and continuing efforts to grow online specialty retailers and prestige salons to optimize our portfolio we will focus on improving our margins and share in our distribution channels we plan to reenergize certain of our brands through the introduction of products that feature advances in research and technology at the same time we will be investing in initiatives to incubate and develop next generation products and brands as well as driving turnaround brands toward sustainable profitability levels we intend to leverage our regional organizations to increase effectiveness and efficiencies while utilizing strategic partnerships alliances and licensing to build scale in research and development distribution and thirdparty manufacturing 

  

  

during fiscal 2010 the first year of our strategy our business continued to rebound from the global economic challenges and uncertainties that had a significant impact on our results during the prior fiscal year despite these conditions some of which continue to exist our results for the year ended june 30 2010 exceeded our net sales and profitability expectations that we had at the beginning of the fiscal year these results in part stem from stronger net sales and savings achieved in connection with our multifaceted cost savings program including favorable product mix which reflects our strategic emphasis on skin care products resizing restructuring and other cost containment initiatives the improved net sales reflected growth in our three largest brands continued strong growth in asia a substantial rebound in the company’s travel retail business and a betterthanexpected holiday selling season in the united states and the united kingdom net sales also benefited from further favorability in foreign currency translation 

  

during most of fiscal 2010 we engaged in a more strategically focused approach to spending in light of the global economic downturn and the management of several external potential risks which did not materialize in the current year this was accomplished in part by executing on certain initiatives designed to drive out nonvalue added costs optimize productivity and increase financial discipline although we remain cautious regarding global economic uncertainties and other risks that may affect our business we accelerated investment spending behind our brands and key priorities during the latter part of the fiscal year 

  

in the americas region the increase in net sales during the currentyear period was primarily attributable to growth in canada and latin america net sales in the united states benefited from new skin care and makeup product offerings and an increase in sales of certain designer fragrances through selfselect outlets we have also seen an improvement in the net sales of many of our higherend prestige products which were negatively impacted by a change in spending patterns of consumers as a result of the economic downturn in the prior year offsetting these improvements were lower net sales due to our exit from the global wholesale distribution of the prescriptives brand in addition the us department store channel continues to be negatively impacted by a soft retail environment low store traffic and competitive pressures particularly in the fragrance product category net sales results in alternative channels within the region were generally mixed in our freestanding retail stores net sales growth was fueled by new product launches from m ž a ž c partially offset by lower sales resulting from the closing of certain underperforming stores for various brands we had strong growth in net sales of our products sold over the internet while direct response television sales declined 

  

our business in europe the middle east  africa generated a strong net sales increase during fiscal 2010 aided by the favorable impact of foreign currency translation sales and profits in our travel retail business have exceeded our expectations as a result of successful product launches higher global airline passenger traffic select trade restocking and new points of distribution the travel retail business has also begun to reap the benefits of the implementation of many programs designed to enhance the consumer’s hightouch experience our hightouch approach promotes the total value we offer by leveraging our inperson and virtual assets as well as merchandising and education to provide a customized consumer experience net sales in most markets also increased during the current year reflecting an improving retail environment new product launches and rebounding sales from many of our higherend prestige products despite these positive results the impact of the global economic uncertainties are still being felt in certain countries where there remain soft retail environments select retailer destocking and tight working capital management activities by retailers 

  

at this time our business in the asiapacific region has been least affected by the global economic uncertainties with net sales growing in all countries in the region several of which reflected significant favorable impact of foreign currency translation net sales in china rose at a fast pace as we continue our growth in this emerging market new skin care product launches and an improving retail environment helped most countries in the region generate strong net sales increases during fiscal 2010 our business in japan continued to be challenging due to difficult economic conditions as reported net sales increases were generated by the strengthening of the japanese yen 

  

looking ahead to fiscal 2011 we believe we have a strong diverse brand portfolio with global reach and potential we have a history of outstanding creativity innovation and entrepreneurship and initial successes in expanding our hightouch service model beyond department stores and believe we have a passionate highlytalented workforce to help us achieve our longterm strategy our balance sheet cash flows and gross margin are strong however we continue to operate in a challenging environment we have a number of areas to improve including further enhancements to our cost structure sharing operational best practices internally increasing traffic to where our products are sold and further diversification of distribution channels 

  

charges associated with restructuring activities 

  

in an effort to drive down costs and achieve synergies within our organization in february 2009 we announced the implementation of a multifaceted cost savings program the “program” to position the company to achieve longterm profitable growth we anticipate the program will result in related restructuring and other special charges inclusive of cumulative charges recorded to date and over the next few fiscal years totaling between 350 million and 450 million before taxes 

  

we expect that the implementation of this program combined with other ongoing cost savings efforts will result in savings of approximately 450 million to 550 million beginning with approximately 360 million of savings in fiscal 2010 including the reduction of certain costs relative to an assumed normalized spending pattern our longrange forecast for operating margin reflects these anticipated savings net of strategic investments 

  

  

the program focuses on a redesign of our organizational structure in order to integrate the company in a more cohesive way and operate more globally across brands and functions a principal aspect of the program is the reduction of the workforce by approximately 2000 employees specific actions taken during the year ended june 30 2010 included 

  

·   resize and reorganize the organization — we continued the realignment and optimization of our organization to better leverage scale improve productivity and reduce complexity in each region and across various functions this included reduction of the workforce which occurred through the consolidation of certain functions through a combination of normal attrition and job eliminations 

  

·   turnaround or exit unprofitable operations — to improve the profitability in certain of our brands and regions we have selectively exited certain channels of distribution categories and markets during the first quarter of fiscal 2010 we approved the exit from the global wholesale distribution of our prescriptives brand which was completed during the fiscal year in connection with these activities we recorded a reserve for product returns wrote off inventory and incurred costs to reduce workforce and other exit costs also during fiscal 2010 we approved a restructuring initiative that included the reformulation of ojon brand products 

  

·   outsourcing — in order to balance the growing need for information technology support with our efforts to provide the most efficient and cost effective solutions we continued the outsourcing of certain information technology processes we incurred costs to transition services to an outsource provider 

  

the following table presents aggregate restructuring charges related to the program 

  

   

the total amount of restructuring charges expected to be incurred including those recorded as set forth in the table above plus other initiatives approved through august 17 2010 include approximately 112 million to 113 million for employeerelated costs approximately 18 million in asset writeoffs which includes 88 million related to the impairment of other intangible assets and approximately 23 million of contract terminations and other exit costs 

  

the following table presents accrued restructuring and the related activity under the program 

  

   

accrued restructuring charges at june 30 2010 are expected to result in cash expenditures funded from cash provided by operations of approximately 25 million and 6 million in fiscal 2011 and 2012 respectively 

  

  

we recorded other special charges in connection with the implementation of the program for the years ended june 30 2010 and 2009 of 123 million and 101 million respectively related to consulting other professional services and accelerated depreciation the total amount of other special charges expected to be incurred to implement these initiatives including those recorded through june 30 2010 plus other initiatives approved through august 17 2010 is approximately 41 million for the year ended june 30 2010 and primarily related to the exit from the global wholesale distribution of prescriptives products we recorded 157 million reflecting sales returns less a related cost of sales of 25 million and a writeoff of inventory associated with exiting unprofitable operations of 104 million for the year ended june 30 2009 we recorded 81 million reflecting sales returns less a related cost of sales of 12 million and a writeoff of inventory of 80 million associated with exiting unprofitable operations the total amounts expected to be incurred including those recorded through june 30 2010 plus other initiatives approved through august 17 2010 is between 35 million and 39 million related to sales returns and approximately 15 million related to inventory writeoffs 

  

total charges associated with restructuring activities included in operating income for the years ended june 30 2010 and 2009 was 847 million and 917 million respectively 

  

goodwill other intangible asset and longlived asset impairments 

  

during the second quarter of fiscal 2010 the darphin reporting unit identified issues related to the planned streamlining of its distribution process resulting in revisions to its internal forecasts we concluded that these changes in circumstances in the darphin reporting unit triggered the need for an interim impairment test of its trademark and goodwill we determined that the trademark was impaired with fair value estimated based upon the relieffromroyalty method and therefore recorded an impairment charge of 58 million at the exchange rate in effect at that time in the skin care product category and in the europe the middle east  africa region after adjusting the carrying value of the trademark we completed step one of the impairment test for goodwill and concluded that the fair value of the darphin reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value including goodwill the fair value of the reporting unit was based upon the income approach utilizing estimated cash flows and a terminal value discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows 

  

during the second quarter of fiscal 2010 the ojon reporting unit altered and delayed certain components of its future expansion plans resulting in revisions to its internal forecasts we concluded that these changes in circumstances in the ojon reporting unit triggered the need for an interim impairment review of its goodwill and trademark additionally these changes in circumstances were also an indicator that the carrying amount of the product formulation intangible asset and customer list may not be recoverable we performed an interim impairment test for the trademark and a recoverability test for the product formulation intangible asset and customer list as of december 31 2009 for the product formulation intangible asset we concluded that the carrying amount of this asset was recoverable however for the ojon trademark and customer list we concluded that the carrying values exceeded their estimated fair values which were determined based on the application of a royalty rate to discounted projected future cash flows “relieffromroyalty method” for the trademark and discounted projected future cash flows for the customer list as a result we recognized asset impairment charges of 60 million for the trademark and 172 million for the customer list at the exchange rate in effect at that time after adjusting the carrying value of the trademark and customer list we completed an interim impairment test for goodwill and recorded a goodwill impairment charge related to the ojon reporting unit of 166 million at the exchange rate in effect at that time the fair value of the reporting unit was based upon weighting of the income and market approaches utilizing estimated cash flows and a terminal value discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows as well as valuation multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies that are applied to operating performance of the reporting unit these impairment charges were reflected in the hair care and skin care product categories and in the americas region 

  

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 we approved a restructuring initiative that included the reformulation of ojon brand products we concluded that this change in the formulation was an indicator that the carrying amount of the product formulation intangible asset may not be recoverable we performed an impairment test of the product formulation intangible asset and concluded that the carrying value of this intangible asset exceeded its estimated fair value which was determined based on discounted projected future cash flows as a result we recognized an asset impairment charge of 88 million which is included in restructuring and other special charges in the consolidated statement of earnings 

  

as of our annual stepone goodwill impairment test on april 1 2010 t he closest margin for fair value exceeding carrying value was approximately 1 for the ojon reporting unit as of june 30 2010 the carrying value of goodwill related to the ojon reporting unit was 280 million the fair value of the reporting unit was based upon weighting of the income and market approaches utilizing estimated cash flows and a terminal value discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows as well as valuation multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies that are applied to operating performance of the reporting unit the key assumptions that were used to determine the estimated fair value of the reporting unit were predicated on planned new market initiatives including the rollout of reformulated product lines and expanded international distribution if such plans do not materialize if there is a delay in new market initiatives or if there is a decline in the business environment in which this reporting unit operates a resulting change in the key assumptions including a decrease in the terminal value or increase in the discount rate could have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and it is possible we could recognize an impairment charge in the future all other reporting units’ fair values substantially exceeded their respective carrying values 

  

  

as of our annual indefinitelived asset impairment test on april 1 2010 we determined that the fair values of two trademarks were equal to their carrying values as of june 30 2010 the carrying values of these trademarks were 190 million and 170 million the fair values of these trademarks were based upon the relieffromroyalty method the key assumptions that were used to determine the estimated fair value of one trademark were predicated on expanded distribution in the salon channel and into other channels the key assumptions that were used to determine the estimated fair value of the other trademark were predicated on planned new market initiatives including the rollout of reformulated product lines and expanded international distribution if such plans do not materialize if there is a delay in new market initiatives or if there is a decline in the business environment a resulting change in the key assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair values of these trademarks and it is possible we could recognize an impairment charge in the future the fair values of all other indefinitelived intangible assets substantially exceeded their respective carrying values 

  

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 we recorded noncash impairment charges of 27 million to reduce the net carrying value of certain retail store and counter assets to their estimated fair value which was determined based on discounted projected future cash flows lower than expected operating cash flow performance relative to the affected assets revisions in internal forecasts and the impact of the current economic environment on their projected future results of operations indicated that the carrying value of the related longlived assets were not recoverable these longlived asset impairment charges primarily related to the company’s skin care and makeup businesses in the americas and the europe middle east and africa regions and are included in impairment of other intangible and longlived assets in the consolidated statements of earnings 

  

although our financial performance reflected improved economic conditions we expect global economic uncertainties to continue to impact our business as the duration and magnitude of the volatility of the current economic conditions remain uncertain we will continue to monitor and evaluate the potential impact on our business and on our interim and annual impairment testing accordingly it is possible that we would recognize an impairment charge in the future with respect to goodwill other intangible assets and longlived assets 

  

impact of recent economic events in venezuela 

  

cumulative inflation in venezuela has exceeded 100 over the threeyear period ended december 31 2009 as measured using the blended consumer price indexnational consumer price index as a result venezuela has been designated as a highly inflationary economy effective january 1 2010 and as such the us dollar has become the functional currency of our subsidiary in venezuela prior to being designated as highly inflationary we translated the financial statements of our subsidiary in venezuela using the official exchange rate of 215 beginning january 1 2010 currency remeasurement adjustments for this subsidiary’s financial statements and other transactional foreign exchange gains and losses were reflected in earnings translation adjustments that were recorded through december 31 2009 prior to being designated as highly inflationary remain in equity as part of other comprehensive income 

  

on january 8 2010 the venezuelan government announced the devaluation of its currency from an official exchange rate of 215 bolivars per us dollar to a dualrate regime of 260 bolivars per us dollar for goods deemed “essential” and 430 bolivars per us dollar for most other imports and repatriation of dividends by foreign investors the “official rate” from january 2010 through may 2010 we remeasured bolivardenominated monetary assets and liabilities at the official exchange rate of 430 bolivars per us dollar as none of our transactions fell into the essential classification in june 2010 the venezuelan government created a third officiallysanctioned exchange rate based on trading bands determined by the central bank of venezuela in light of the venezuelan government’s recent actions we determined that the settlement of bolivardenominated transactions could only be achieved using the third officiallysanctioned rate accordingly beginning june 1 2010 the bolivardenominated monetary assets and liabilities of our subsidiary in venezuela were remeasured at the third officiallysanctioned rate which was 530 bolivars per us dollar at june 30 2010 concurrent with the establishment of the third officiallysanctioned rate the venezuelan government also instituted a cap on companies exchanging bolivars for us dollars of 350000 per month while these sanctions do not have an immediate significant impact on our ability to do business in venezuela they may limit our growth opportunities there in the future 

  

as a result of the change to highly inflationary accounting the prior use of different translating and remeasuring exchange rates for us dollardenominated net liabilities and the devaluation of the bolivar and remeasurement at the third officiallysanctioned rate we recorded higher costs and net charges of approximately 9 million for the year ended june 30 2010 this amount includes increased cost of sales associated with historical dollar costs of inventory as of june 30 2010 our subsidiary in venezuela had approximately 4 million of net monetary assets denominated in bolivars we do not expect the change to highly inflationary accounting to have a significant impact on our ongoing future consolidated net sales or operating income since we expect to derive less than 1 of our future consolidated net sales and operating income from our business in venezuela 

  

  

impact of new federal legislation 

  

the patient protection and affordable care act the “ppaca” became law on march 23 2010 and on march 30 2010 the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 “hr 4872” became law which makes various amendments to certain aspects of the ppaca certain of the provisions of this legislation that became effective during fiscal 2010 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements the potential impact of other facets of the legislation that are not yet effective but applicable to our postretirement benefit plans was evaluated and determined to not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements we will continue to monitor the issuance of further health care reform guidance from regulators to determine the potential impact on our business and consolidated financial statements if any 

  

compliance assurance program 

  

during the third quarter of fiscal 2010 we accepted an invitation from the us internal revenue service the “irs” to join the compliance assurance program “cap” beginning with the fiscal year ending june 30 2011 the objective of cap is to reduce taxpayer burden and uncertainty while assuring the irs of the accuracy of income tax returns prior to filing thereby reducing or eliminating the need for postfiling examinations 

  

fiscal 2010 as compared with fiscal 2009 

  

net sales 

  

net sales increased 6 or 4720 million to 77958 million reflecting increases in asiapacific and europe the middle east  africa and to a lesser extent the americas net sales increases in the skin care makeup and hair care product categories were partially offset by declines in the fragrance category excluding the impact of foreign currency translation net sales increased 5 the following discussions of net sales by product categories and geographic regions exclude the impact of returns associated with restructuring activities of 157 million recorded during the current year we believe the following analysis of net sales better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business

we strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market which may account for differences in regional sales growth 

  

  

cost of sales 

  

cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales decreased to 235 as compared with 257 in the prior year this improvement primarily reflected our efforts in connection with the program including favorable changes in the mix of our business of approximately 70 basis points a decrease in obsolescence charges of approximately 60 basis points and favorable manufacturing variances of 40 basis points also contributing to the improvement in cost of sales margin were the favorable comparison to the prior year when we recorded excess overhead costs that were not expected to be recovered of approximately 30 basis points and the favorable effect of exchange rates and a decrease in the timing and level of promotional activities of approximately 10 basis points each 

  

since certain promotional activities are a component of sales or cost of sales and the timing and level of promotions vary with our promotional calendar we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in the cost of sales percentage in addition future cost of sales mix may be impacted by the inclusion of potential new brands or channels of distribution which have margin and product cost structures different from those of our current mix of business 

  

operating expenses 

  

operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 664 as compared with 686 in the prior year and reflects the impact of the strong growth in net sales during fiscal 2010 this improvement primarily reflected lower selling shipping general and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales of approximately 180 basis points due to various cost containment efforts implemented as part of the program and a strategically focused approach to spending lower charges associated with restructuring activities of 30 basis points the favorable comparison to the prior year related to other intangible asset impairment charges of approximately 20 basis points and lower net losses from foreign exchange transactions of approximately 10 basis points partially offsetting these improvements were higher strategic investment spending of approximately 10 basis points and higher advertising sampling and merchandising costs of approximately 10 basis points

cost of sales 

  

cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales increased to 257 as compared with 252 in fiscal 2008 this change reflected an increase in obsolescence charges of approximately 40 basis points excess overhead costs that were not recovered due to lower production levels of approximately 30 basis points and the negative effect of exchange rates of approximately 20 basis points the increase in cost of sales margin also reflected the fiscal 2009 impact of charges associated with restructuring activities and an increase in the level and timing of promotional activities of approximately 10 basis points each partially offsetting these increases were favorable changes in the mix of our business and from other manufacturing variances of approximately 50 basis points and 10 basis points respectively 

  

since certain promotional activities are a component of sales or cost of sales and the timing and level of promotions vary with our promotional calendar we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in the cost of sales percentage in addition future cost of sales mix may be impacted by the inclusion of new brands or channels of distribution which have margin and product cost structures different from those of our current mix of business 

  

operating expenses 

  

operating expenses increased to 686 of net sales as compared with 645 of net sales in fiscal 2008 in light of the then current economic conditions we applied various costcontainment measures to maintain expenses in line with our business needs while the implementation of these initiatives helped reduce total operating expenses as compared with fiscal 2008 the dramatic decline in net sales during fiscal 2009 was the principal factor that negatively impacted our operating expense margin in addition to the decline in net sales operating expense margin increased by approximately 110 basis points due to charges associated with restructuring activities as previously discussed

despite a reduction in actual selling advertising merchandising and sampling spending operating expense margin increased by approximately 60 basis points driven by the decline in consumer demand in the economic environment changes in advertising merchandising and sampling spending result from the type timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts as well as the markets being emphasized

financial condition 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

overview 

  

our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program borrowings from the issuance of longterm debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks and other lenders in the united states and abroad at june 30 2010 we had cash and cash equivalents of 11207 million compared with 8645 million at june 30 2009 our cash and cash equivalents are maintained at a number of financial institutions as of june 30 2010 less than 10 of our total cash was insured by governmental agencies to mitigate the risk of uninsured balances we select financial institutions based on their credit ratings and financial strength and perform ongoing evaluations of these institutions to limit our concentration risk exposure 

  

our business is seasonal in nature and accordingly our working capital needs vary from time to time we may enter into investing and financing transactions that require additional funding to the extent that these needs exceed cash from operations we could subject to market conditions issue commercial paper issue longterm debt securities or borrow under our revolving credit facilities 

  

on may 24 2010 we completed a cash tender offer for 1300 million principal amount of our 2012 senior notes at a price of 108500 of the principal amount and for 699 million principal amount of our 2013 senior notes at a tender price of 118813 of the principal amount during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 we recorded a pretax expense on the extinguishment of debt of 273 million representing the tender premium the prorata writeoff of unamortized terminated interest rate swap issuance costs and debt discount and tender offer costs associated with both series of notes 

  

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that cash on hand cash generated from operations available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business operations information systems enhancements capital expenditures potential stock repurchases commitments and other contractual obligations on both a nearterm and longterm basis 

  

the effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years generally we have been able to introduce new products at higher prices or increase prices sufficiently to offset cost increases which have been moderate 

  

credit ratings 

  

changes in our credit ratings will likely result in changes in our borrowing costs our credit ratings also impact the cost of our revolving credit facility as discussed below downgrades in our credit ratings may reduce our ability to issue commercial paper andor longterm debt and would likely increase the relative costs of borrowing a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating as of august 13 2010 our commercial paper is rated a1 by standard  poor’s and p1 by moody’s and our longterm debt is rated a with a stable outlook by standard  poor’s and a2 with a stable outlook by moody’s

7   as of june 30 2010 we were in compliance with all restrictive covenants including limitations on indebtedness and liens and expect continued compliance 

  

we have a 7500 million commercial paper program under which we may issue commercial paper in the united states at june 30 2010 there was no commercial paper outstanding we also have 1895 million in additional uncommitted credit facilities of which 103 million was used as of june 30 2010 we do not anticipate difficulties in securing this form of working capital financing 

  

we have an undrawn 7500 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on april 26 2012 this facility may be used primarily to provide credit support for our commercial paper program to repurchase shares of our common stock and for general corporate purposes up to the equivalent of 250 million of the credit facility is available for multicurrency loans the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on libor or on the higher of prime which is the rate of interest publicly announced by the administrative agent or ½ plus the federal funds rate we incurred costs of approximately 03 million to establish the facility which will be amortized over the term of the facility the credit facility has an annual fee of 04 million payable quarterly based on our current credit ratings this facility also contains a crossdefault provision whereby a failure to pay other material financial obligations in excess of 500 million after grace periods and absent a waiver from the lenders would result in an event of default and the acceleration of the maturity of any outstanding debt under this facility as of june 30 2010 we were in compliance with all related financial and other restrictive covenants including limitations on indebtedness and liens and expect continued compliance the financial covenant of this facility requires an interest expense coverage ratio of greater than 31 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter the interest expense coverage ratio is defined in the credit agreement as the ratio of consolidated ebitda which does not represent a measure of our operating results as defined under us generally accepted accounting principles to consolidated interest expense and is calculated as stipulated in the agreement as follows 

  

  

   

1   in accordance with the credit agreement this period represents the four most recent quarters 

2   includes interest expense net and interest expense on debt extinguishment 

3   excludes amortization of debt discount and derivative and debt issuance costs as they are already included in interest expense net 

4   includes goodwill other intangible asset and longlived asset impairments and noncash charges associated with restructuring activities 

5   as provided for in the credit agreement 

  

we have a fixed rate promissory note agreement with a financial institution pursuant to which we may borrow up to 1500 million in the form of loan participation notes through one of our subsidiaries in europe the interest rate on borrowings under this agreement is at an allin fixed rate determined by the lender and agreed to by us at the date of each borrowing at june 30 2010 no borrowings were outstanding under this agreement debt issuance costs incurred related to this agreement were de minimis 

  

we have an overdraft borrowing agreement with a financial institution pursuant to which our subsidiary in turkey may be credited to satisfy outstanding negative daily balances arising from its business operations the total balance outstanding at any time shall not exceed 400 million turkish lira 253 million at the exchange rate at june 30 2010 the interest rate applicable to each such credit shall be up to a maximum of 175 basis points per annum above the spot rate charged by the lender or the lender’s floating call rate agreed to by us at each borrowing there were no debt issuance costs incurred related to this agreement the outstanding balance at june 30 2010 46 million at the exchange rate at june 30 2010 is classified as shortterm debt in our consolidated balance sheet 

  

we have a 15 billion japanese yen 169 million at the exchange rate at june 30 2010 revolving credit facility that expires on march 31 2011 and a 15 billion japanese yen 169 million at the exchange rate at june 30 2010 revolving credit facility that expires on march 31 2012 the interest rates on borrowings under these credit facilities are based on tibor tokyo interbank offered rate plus 45 and 75 respectively and the facility fees incurred on undrawn balances are 15 basis points and 25 basis points respectively at june 30 2010 no borrowings were outstanding under these facilities 

  

total debt as a percent of total capitalization excluding noncontrolling interest decreased to 39 at june 30 2010 from 46 at june 30 2009 primarily as a result of the debt extinguishment as previously discussed coupled with an increase in stockholders’ equity driven by higher net earnings during fiscal 2010 

  

  

cash flows 

  

net cash provided by operating activities was 9567 million 6960 million and 6901 million in fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the increase in operating cash flows in fiscal 2010 as compared with fiscal 2009 primarily reflected higher net earnings an increase in accounts payable due to the timing of payments and to a lesser extent a decrease in accounts receivable this increase also reflected higher accrued employee compensation and advertising merchandising and sampling partially offset by higher cash paid in fiscal 2010 for restructuring and severance these changes were partially offset by the building of safety stock for the april 2010 implementation of sap at our north american manufacturing plants and the prioryear period impact of significant inventory reductions also partially offsetting the improvements were higher discretionary pension contributions as described in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources — pension and postretirement plan funding ” approximately 60 million of the change in deferred income taxes was offset by a correlative change in noncurrent accrued income taxes reflecting the balance sheet presentation of unrecognized tax benefits the increase in operating cash flows in fiscal 2009 as compared with fiscal 2008 primarily reflected a decrease in inventory due in part to thenplanned reductions in skus as well as lower accounts receivable as a result of lower sales and an improvement in days sales outstanding these activities were partially offset by lower net earnings and an increase in income tax receivables as compared with fiscal 2008 as well as a reduction in cash provided by certain working capital components including payments for accounts payable and other liabilities 

  

net cash used for investing activities was 2814 million 3395 million and 4785 million in fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the decrease in investing cash outflows during fiscal 2010 primarily reflected lower acquisition activity in the current year as compared with the acquisitions of applied genetics incorporated dermatics “agi” and businesses engaged in the wholesale distribution and retail sale of aveda products in the prior year the change also reflected lower cash payments in the current year related to counters and leasehold improvements the decrease in investing activities during fiscal 2009 primarily reflected lower capital expenditure activity and the fiscal 2008 acquisition of ojon corporation partially offset by the fiscal 2009 acquisitions of agi and aveda distributors 

  

net cash used for financing activities was 4061 million in fiscal 2010 net cash provided by financing activities was 1258 million in fiscal 2009 and net cash used for financing activities was 781 million in fiscal 2008 the change in net cash flows used for financing activities as compared with net cash flows provided by financing activities in fiscal 2009 was primarily driven by the prior year’s net proceeds from the issuance of the 2013 senior notes and the current year’s partial redemption of the 2012 and 2013 senior notes also contributing to this change was an increase in treasury stock purchases and repayments related to ojon promissory notes partially offset by higher cash inflows from stock option exercises and the prior year’s repayment of commercial paper borrowings the fiscal 2009 increase in cash provided by financing activities primarily reflected the issuance of the 2013 senior notes and a decrease in treasury stock purchases partially offset by repayments of outstanding commercial paper 

  

dividends 

  

on november 13 2009 the board of directors declared an annual dividend of 55 per share on our class a and class b common stock of which an aggregate of 1091 million was paid on december 16 2009 to stockholders of record at the close of business on november 30 2009 the annual common stock dividend declared during fiscal 2009 was 55 per share of which an aggregate of 1084 million was paid on december 17 2008 to stockholders of record at the close of business on december 1 2008 

  

pension and postretirement plan funding 

  

several factors influence the annual funding requirements for our pension plans for the us qualified plan our funding policy consists of annual contributions at a rate that provides for future plan benefits and maintains appropriate funded percentages such contribution is not less than the minimum required by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended “erisa” and subsequent pension legislation and is not more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes for each international plan our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations in addition amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions as detailed in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — critical accounting policies and estimates ” the effect of our pension plan funding on future operating results will depend on economic conditions employee demographics mortality rates the number of participants electing to take lumpsum distributions investment performance and funding decisions 

  

the unprecedented economic downturn that started in fiscal 2009 created a difficult investment environment for the us qualified plan we maintain an investment strategy of matching the duration of a substantial portion of the plan assets with the duration of the underlying plan liabilities this strategy as well as the recovery of equity investments in fiscal 2010 helped mitigate the negative effects of the downturn and assisted in maintaining a funded ratio of more than 100 as of june 30 2010 for fiscal 2010 and 2009 there was no minimum contribution to the us qualified plan required by erisa we made discretionary contributions totaling 390 million and 170 million to the us qualified plan during fiscal 2010 and 2009 respectively we made a discretionary contribution to our postretirement plan in the united states of 60 million during fiscal 2010 at this time we do not expect to make cash contributions to the us qualified plan or our postretirement plan in the united states during fiscal 2011 however as we continue to monitor the performance of our plan assets we may decide to make discretionary contributions 

  

  

for fiscal 2010 and 2009 we made benefit payments under our nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan of 77 million and 81 million respectively we expect to make benefit payments under this plan during fiscal 2011 of approximately 8 million for fiscal 2010 and 2009 we made cash contributions to our international defined benefit pension plans of 682 million and 418 million respectively we expect to make contributions under these plans during fiscal 2011 of approximately 21 million 

  

commitments and contingencies 

  

certain of our business acquisition agreements include “earnout” provisions these provisions generally require that we pay to the seller or sellers of the business additional amounts based on the performance of the acquired business   since the size of each payment depends upon performance of the acquired business we do not expect that such payments will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or financial condition 

  

for additional contingencies refer to “item 3 legal proceedings” 

  

contractual obligations 

  

the following table summarizes scheduled maturities of our contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed and determinable as of june 30 2010 

  

   

1   includes longterm and shortterm debt and the related projected interest costs and to a lesser extent capital lease commitments interest costs on longterm and shortterm debt are projected to be 606 million in fiscal 2011 608 million in fiscal 2012 536 million in fiscal 2013 440 million in fiscal 2014 350 million in fiscal 2015 and 6198 million thereafter projected interest costs on variable rate instruments were calculated using market rates at june 30 2010 refer to “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data — note 10  debt ” 

2   minimum operating lease commitments only include base rent certain leases provide for contingent rents that are not measurable at inception and primarily include rents based on a percentage of sales in excess of stipulated levels as well as common area maintenance these amounts are excluded from minimum operating lease commitments and are included in the determination of total rent expense when it is probable that the expense has been incurred and the amount is reasonably measurable 

3   unconditional purchase obligations primarily include inventory commitments estimated future earnout payments estimated royalty payments pursuant to license agreements advertising commitments capital improvement commitments planned funding of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations commitments pursuant to executive compensation arrangements obligations related to our cost savings initiatives and acquisitions in july 2010 we acquired smashbox beauty cosmetics for a purchase price of approximately 250 million which was funded by cash provided by operations future earnout payments and future royalty and advertising commitments were estimated based on planned future sales for the term that was in effect at june 30 2010 without consideration for potential renewal periods 

4   refer to “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data — note 8 — income taxes” for information regarding unrecognized tax benefits during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 we made a cash payment of 205 million to the us treasury as an advance deposit which is not reflected as a reduction to the 413 million as of june 30 2010 the noncurrent portion of our unrecognized tax benefits including related accrued interest and penalties was 1527 million at this time the settlement period for the noncurrent portion of the unrecognized tax benefits including related accrued interest and penalties cannot be determined and therefore was not included 

  

derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 

  

we address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments we primarily enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates and interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on our aggregate liability portfolio we also enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes costs associated with entering into these derivative financial instruments have not been material to our consolidated financial results 

  

  

for each derivative contract entered into where we look to obtain special hedge accounting treatment we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items as well as our riskmanagement objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction the nature of the risk being hedged how the hedging instruments’ effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively and a description of the method of measuring ineffectiveness this process includes linking all derivatives to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions we also formally assess both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items if it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge we will be required to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively 

  

foreign exchange risk management 

  

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge anticipated transactions as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies for periods consistent with our identified exposures the purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on costs and on the cash flows that we receive from foreign subsidiaries the majority of foreign currency forward contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries we may also enter into foreign currency option contracts to hedge anticipated transactions the foreign currency forward contracts entered into to hedge anticipated transactions have been designated as foreign currency cashflow hedges and have varying maturities through the end of june 2011 hedge effectiveness of foreign currency forward contracts is based on a hypothetical derivative methodology and excludes the portion of fair value attributable to the spotforward difference which is recorded in currentperiod earnings hedge effectiveness of foreign currency option contracts is based on a dollar offset methodology the ineffective portion of both foreign currency forward and option contracts is recorded in currentperiod earnings for hedge contracts that are no longer deemed highly effective hedge accounting is discontinued and gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income loss are reclassified to earnings when the underlying forecasted transaction occurs if it is probable that the forecasted transaction will no longer occur then any gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income loss are reclassified to currentperiod earnings as of june 30 2010 these foreign currency cashflow hedges were highly effective in all material respects 

  

at june 30 2010 we had foreign currency forward contracts in the amount of 13488 million the foreign currencies included in foreign currency forward contracts notional value stated in us dollars are principally the swiss franc 2575 million british pound 2419 million canadian dollar 1522 million euro 1480 million hong kong dollar 973 million australian dollar 883 million and japanese yen 623 million 

  

interest rate risk management 

  

we enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the exposure to interest rate fluctuations on our funded indebtedness and anticipated issuance of debt for periods consistent with the identified exposures we have interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount totaling 2500 million to effectively convert the fixed rate interest on our 2017 senior notes to variable interest rates based on sixmonth libor these interest rate swap agreements are designated as fairvalue hedges of the related longterm debt and meet the accounting criteria that permit changes in the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements to exactly offset changes in the fair value of the underlying longterm debt as of june 30 2010 these fairvalue hedges were highly effective in all material respects 

  

credit risk 

  

as a matter of policy we only enter into derivative contracts with counterparties that have at least an “a” or equivalent credit rating the counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions exposure to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to the gross fair value of contracts in asset positions which totaled 577 million at june 30 2010 to manage this risk we have established strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored and reported to management accordingly management believes risk of loss under these hedging contracts is remote 

  

certain of our derivative financial instruments contain creditriskrelated contingent features as of june 30 2010 we were in compliance with such features and there were no derivative financial instruments with creditriskrelated contingent features that were in a net liability position 

  

market risk 

  

we use a valueatrisk model to assess the market risk of our derivative financial instruments valueatrisk represents the potential losses for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors for a specified time period and confidence level we estimate valueatrisk across all of our derivative financial instruments using a model with historical volatilities and correlations calculated over the past 250day period the high low and average measured valueatrisk for the twelve months ended june 30 2010 and 2009 related to our foreign exchange and interest rate contracts are as follows 

  

  

   

the change in the average valueatrisk measures from the prior year related to our foreign exchange contracts reflected a different size and mix of the portfolio the change in the average valueatrisk measures from the prior year related to our interest rate contracts reflected lower interest rate volatilities the model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 percent confidence level we used a statistical simulation model that valued our derivative financial instruments against one thousand randomly generated market price paths 

  

our calculated valueatrisk exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may or may not occur it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated based upon actual fluctuations in market rates operating exposures and the timing thereof and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year 

  

we believe however that any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the derivative financial instrument was intended 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

we do not maintain any offbalance sheet arrangements transactions obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations 

  

recently adopted and recently issued accounting standards 

  

refer to “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data — note 2 — summary of significant accounting policies” for discussion regarding the impact of recently adopted accounting standards as well as the impact of accounting standards that were recently issued but not yet effective on our consolidated financial statements

information systems 

  

information systems support business processes including product development marketing sales order processing production distribution and finance of the many systems currently being utilized the most significant to our business needs are i a centralized data repository of essential attributes for each of the products we offer or plan to offer which enables us to globally manufacture and market products of consistent quality ii a sales analysis system to track weekly sales at the stock keeping unit sku level at most significant retail sales locations ie sellthrough data increasing our understanding of consumer preferences and enabling us to coordinate more effectively our product development manufacturing and marketing strategies iii an automated replenishment system with many of our key domestic customers allowing us to replenish inventories for individual points of sale automatically with minimal paperwork and iv an inventory management system to provide us with a global view of finished goods availability relative to actual requirements 

  

we expect that these systems will continue to provide pertinent inventory and sales data in the short term however as part of our longterm effort to enhance these systems and increase productivity we are implementing our strategic modernization initiative “smi” which includes an enterprisewide global program that we expect will deliver a single set of integrated data processes and technologies which would be scalable and used to standardize business processes across brands operating units and sales affiliates as part of smi we anticipate the continued migration of our operations to sap with the majority of our locations being implemented through fiscal 2012

the beauty business is highly competitive and if we are unable to compete effectively our results will suffer 

  

we face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world including multinational consumer product companies some of these competitors have greater resources than we do and may be able to respond to changing business and economic conditions more quickly than us competition in the beauty business is based on pricing of products innovation perceived value service to the consumer promotional activities advertising special events new product introductions electronic commerce initiatives and other activities it is difficult for us to predict the timing and scale of our competitors’ actions in these areas in particular the fragrance category in the united states is influenced by the high volume of new product introductions by diverse companies across several different distribution channels also the trend toward consolidation in the retail trade particularly in developed markets such as the united states and western europe has resulted in us becoming increasingly dependent on key retailers including largeformat retailers who have increased their bargaining strength this trend has also resulted in an increased risk related to the concentration of our customers a severe adverse impact on their business operations could have a corresponding material adverse effect on us our ability to compete also depends on the continued strength of our brands our ability to attract and retain key talent and other personnel the efficiency of our manufacturing facilities and distribution network and our ability to protect our intellectual property our inability to continue to compete effectively in countries around the world could have an adverse impact on our business 

  

our inability to anticipate and respond to market trends and changes in consumer preferences could adversely affect our financial results 

  

our continued success depends on our ability to anticipate gauge and react in a timely and costeffective manner to changes in consumer tastes for skin care makeup fragrance and hair care products as well as to where and how consumers shop for those products we must continually work to develop produce and market new products maintain and enhance the recognition of our brands achieve a favorable mix of products and refine our approach as to how and where we market and sell our products while we devote considerable effort and resources to shape analyze and respond to consumer preferences we recognize that consumer tastes cannot be predicted with certainty and can change rapidly if we are unable to anticipate and respond to trends in the market for our products and changing consumer demands our financial results will suffer 

  

our future success depends on our ability to achieve our longterm strategy 

  

our vision is to be the global leader in prestige beauty to achieve our goal we are implementing a longterm strategy to guide the company through fiscal 2013 the plan has numerous initiatives across regions product categories brands and functions that are designed to leverage our strengths make us more cost efficient and grow our sales 

  

achieving our longterm objectives will require investment in new capabilities brands categories distribution channels technologies and geographic markets these investments may result in shortterm costs without any current revenues and therefore may be dilutive to our earnings at least in the short term in addition we may dispose of or discontinue select brands or streamline operations and incur costs or special charges in doing so although we believe that our strategy will lead to longterm growth in revenue and profitability we may not realize in full or in part the anticipated benefits the failure to realize benefits which may be due to our ability to execute plans or other risks described herein global economic conditions competition changes in the beauty industry and the other risks described herein could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

  

acquisitions may expose us to additional risks 

  

we continuously review acquisition opportunities that would expand our current product offerings our distribution channels increase the size and geographic scope of our operations or otherwise offer growth and operating efficiency opportunities if required the financing for any of these acquisitions could result in an increase in our indebtedness dilute the interests of our stockholders or both acquisitions may entail numerous risks including 

  

·   difficulties in assimilating acquired operations or products including the loss of key employees from or customers of acquired businesses 

·   diversion of management’s attention from our core businesses 

·   adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and 

·   risks of entering distribution channels categories or markets in which we have limited or no prior experience 

  

our failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate acquisitions on favorable terms 

  

we are required to annually test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives to determine if impairment has occurred if the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill or other intangible assets in the period the determination is made we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired there will be an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

a general economic downturn or sudden disruption in business conditions may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items andor the financial strength of our customers that are retailers which could adversely affect our financial results 

  

the general level of consumer spending is affected by a number of factors including general economic conditions inflation interest rates energy costs and consumer confidence generally all of which are beyond our control consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower and may impact sales of our products a decline in consumer purchases of discretionary items also tends to impact our customers that are retailers we generally extend credit to a retailer based on an evaluation of its financial condition usually without requiring collateral however the financial difficulties of a retailer could cause us to curtail or eliminate business with that customer we may also assume more credit risk relating to the receivables from that retailer our inability to collect the receivable from one of our largest customers or from a group of customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition if a retailer was to liquidate we may incur additional costs if we choose to purchase the retailer’s inventory of our products to protect brand equity 

  

in addition sudden disruptions in business conditions for example as a consequence of events such as a pandemic or those that are currently taking place in the middle east or as a result of a terrorist attack retaliation and the threat of further attacks or retaliation or as a result of adverse weather conditions or climate changes can have a short and sometimes longterm impact on consumer spending 

  

events that impact consumers’ willingness or ability to travel andor purchase our products while traveling may impact our travel retail business which is a significant contributor to our overall results 

  

a downturn in the economies in which we sell our products or a sudden disruption of business conditions in those economies could adversely affect our sales and profitability 

  

we face risks associated with the current global credit crisis 

  

the volatility in the financial markets and the related economic downturn in markets throughout the world could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business while we currently generate significant cash flows from our ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities credit markets have recently experienced significant disruptions and certain leading financial institutions have either declared bankruptcy or have shown significant deterioration in their financial stability further deterioration in global financial markets could make future financing difficult or more expensive if any financial institutions that are parties to our undrawn revolving credit facility supporting our commercial paper program or other financing arrangements such as interest rate or foreign exchange hedging instruments were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us this could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain interest rate or foreign currency exposures 

  

  

changes in laws regulations and policies that affect our business could adversely affect our financial results 

  

our business is subject to numerous laws regulations and policies changes in the laws regulations and policies including the interpretation or enforcement thereof that affect or will affect our business including changes in accounting standards tax laws and regulations trade rules and customs regulations and the outcome and expense of legal or regulatory proceedings and any action we may take as a result could adversely affect our financial results 

  

our success depends in part on the quality and safety of our products 

  

our success depends in part on the quality and safety of our products if our products are found to be defective or unsafe or if they otherwise fail to meet our consumers’ standards our relationships with customers or consumers could suffer the appeal of one or more of our brands could be diminished and we could lose sales andor become subject to liability claims any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

our success depends in part on our key personnel 

  

our success depends in part on our ability to retain our key personnel including our executive officers and senior management team the unexpected loss of one or more of our key employees could adversely affect our business our success also depends in part on our continuing ability to identify hire train and retain other highly qualified personnel competition for these employees can be intense we may not be able to attract assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business this risk may be exacerbated by the stresses associated with the implementation of our strategic plan and other initiatives 

  

we are subject to risks related to our international operations 

  

we operate on a global basis with approximately 59 of our fiscal 2009 net sales generated outside the united states we maintain offices in over 40 countries and have key operational facilities located outside the united states that manufacture warehouse or distribute goods for sale throughout the world foreign operations are subject to many risks and uncertainties including 

  

·   fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which can affect our results of operations the value of our foreign assets the relative prices at which we and foreign competitors sell products in the same markets and the cost of certain inventory and noninventory items required in our operations 

·   changes in foreign laws regulations and policies including restrictions on trade import and export license requirements and tariffs and taxes as well as changes in united states laws and regulations relating to foreign trade and investment and 

·   adverse weather conditions social economic and geopolitical conditions such as terrorist attacks war or other military action 

  

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects results of operations and financial condition 

  

a disruption in operations could adversely affect our business and financial results 

  

as a company engaged in manufacturing and distribution on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including industrial accidents environmental events strikes and other labor disputes disruptions in supply chain or information systems loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites product quality control safety licensing requirements and other regulatory issues as well as natural disasters and other external factors over which we have no control if such an event were to occur it could have an adverse affect on our business and financial results 

  

our information systems and websites may be susceptible to outages and other risks 

  

we have information systems that support our business processes including product development marketing sales order processing production distribution finance and intracompany communications throughout the world we have ecommerce and other internet websites in the united states and many other countries these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire floods power loss telecommunications failures breakins and similar events despite the implementation of network security measures our systems may be vulnerable to computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering the occurrence of these or other events could disrupt or damage our information systems and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

  

we are subject to risks associated with implementing global information systems 

  

as part of a program that we call our “strategic modernization initiative” or “smi” we are implementing enterprisewide global programs intended to deliver a single set of integrated data processes and technologies which would be scalable and used to standardize business processes across brands operating units and sales affiliates as part of smi we anticipate the continued migration of our operations to sap with the majority of our locations to be implemented through fiscal 2012 like most entitywide changes to software systems the implementation of smi involves risks and uncertainties failure to implement smi as planned in terms of timing specifications andor costs could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

  

the trading prices of our securities periodically may rise or fall based on the accuracy of predictions of our earnings or other financial performance 

  

our business planning process is designed to maximize our longterm strength growth and profitability not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter we believe that this longerterm focus is in the best interests of the company and our stockholders at the same time however we recognize that it may be helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our forecast of net sales and earnings per share accordingly when we announced our yearend financial results for fiscal 2009 we provided guidance as to our expected net sales and earnings per share for the fiscal year ending june 30 2010 and the quarter ending september 30 2009 while we generally expect to provide updates to our guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter we assume no responsibility to update any of our forwardlooking statements at such times or otherwise in addition the longerterm guidance we provide is based on goals that we believe at the time guidance is given are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years such targets are more speculative than our current quarter and fiscal year expectations 

  

in all of our public statements when we make or update a forwardlooking statement about our sales andor earnings expectations or expectations regarding restructuring or other initiatives we accompany such statements directly or by reference to a public document with a list of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we expect such a list is included among other places in our earnings press release and in our periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission eg in our reports on form 10k and form 10q these and other factors may make it difficult for outside observers such as research analysts to predict what our earnings will be in any given fiscal quarter or year 

  

outside analysts and investors have the right to make their own predictions of our financial results for any future period outside analysts however have access to no more material information about our plans than any other public investor and we do not endorse their predictions as to our future performance nor do we assume any responsibility to correct the predictions of outside analysts or others when they differ from our own internal expectations if and when we announce actual results that differ from those that outside analysts or others have been predicting the market price of our securities could be affected investors who rely on the predictions of outside analysts or others when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk we take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in the prices of our securities 

  

failure to adequately maintain the security of our electronic and other confidential information could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

  

we are dependent upon automated information technology processes as part of our normal business activities we collect and store certain confidential information including personal information with respect to customers and employees we may share some of this information with vendors who assist us with certain aspects of our business moreover the success of our ecommerce operations depends upon the secure transmission of confidential and personal data over public networks including the use of cashless payments any failure on the part of us or our vendors to maintain the security of our confidential data and our employees’ and customers’ personal information including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information could result in business disruption damage to our reputation financial obligations to third parties fines penalties regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs and also result in deterioration in our employees’ and customers’ confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages and thus could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to enhance our information security systems and could result in a disruption to our operations 

  

as we outsource more functions we will become more dependent on the entities performing those functions 

  

as part of our longterm strategy we are continually looking for opportunities to provide essential business services in a more costeffective manner in some cases this requires the outsourcing of functions or parts of functions that can be performed more effectively by external service providers these include certain information systems functions such as information technology operations and certain human resource functions such as employee benefit plan administration while we believe we conduct appropriate due diligence before entering into agreements with the outsourcing entity the failure of one or more entities to provide the expected services provide them on a timely basis or to provide them at the prices we expect may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition

 item 3 legal proceedings  

  

we are involved from time to time in litigation and other legal proceedings incidental to our business management believes that the outcome of current litigation and legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial condition however management’s assessment of our current litigation and other legal proceedings could change in light of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions or other proceedings pending against us not presently known to us or determinations by judges juries or other finders of fact which are not in accord with management’s evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such litigation or proceedings 

  

in 1999 the office of the attorney general of the state of new york the “state” notified the company and ten other entities that they had been identified as potentially responsible parties “prps” with respect to the blydenburgh landfill in islip new york each prp may be jointly and severally liable for the costs of investigation and cleanup which the state estimated in 2006 to be approximately 197 million for all prps in 2001 the state sued other prps including hickey’s carting inc dennis c hickey and maria hickey collectively the “hickey parties” in the us district court for the eastern district of new york to recover such costs in connection with the site and in september 2002 the hickey parties brought contribution actions against the company and other blydenburgh prps these contribution actions seek to recover among other things any damages for which the hickey parties are found liable in the state’s lawsuit against them and related costs and expenses including attorneys’ fees in june 2004 the state added the company and other prps as defendants in its pending case against the hickey parties in april 2006 the company and other defendants added numerous other parties to the case as thirdparty defendants settlement negotiations with the new thirdparty defendants the state the company and other defendants began in july 2006 and have resulted in a proposed consent decree to resolve the case the consent decree requires court approval which the parties are seeking we have accrued an amount which we believe would be necessary to resolve our share of this matter if the settlement is not successfully completed we intend to vigorously defend the pending claims while no assurance can be given as to the ultimate outcome management believes that the resolution of the blydenburgh matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition at june 30 2009 and our results of operations for the three fiscal years ended june 30 2009 are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements these judgments can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition inventory pension and other postretirement benefit costs goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets income taxes and derivatives 

  

management of the company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of the company’s board of directors 

  

revenue recognition 

revenues from merchandise sales are recognized upon transfer of ownership including passage of title to the customer and transfer of the risk of loss related to those goods in the americas region sales are generally recognized at the time the product is shipped to the customer and in the europe middle east  africa and asiapacific regions sales are generally recognized based upon the customer’s receipt in certain circumstances transfer of title takes place at the point of sale for example at our retail stores sales at our retail stores and online are recognized in accordance with a traditional 445 retail calendar where each fiscal quarter is comprised of two 4week periods and one 5week period with one extra week in one quarter every seven years as a result the retail quarterend and the fiscal quarterend may be different by up to six days 

  

revenues are reported on a net sales basis which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual product returns received discounts incentive arrangements with retailers and an amount established for anticipated product returns our practice is to accept product returns from retailers only if properly requested authorized and approved in accepting returns we typically provide a credit to the retailer against accounts receivable from that retailer as a percentage of gross sales returns were 44 44 and 42 in fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

  

our sales return accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net sales this accrual is calculated based on a history of actual returns estimated future returns and information provided by authorized retailers regarding their inventory levels consideration of these factors results in an accrual for anticipated sales returns that reflects increases or decreases related to seasonal fluctuations experience has shown a relationship between retailer inventory levels and sales returns in the subsequent period as well as a consistent pattern of returns due to the seasonal nature of our business in addition as necessary specific accruals may be established for significant future known or anticipated events the types of known or anticipated events that we have considered and will continue to consider include but are not limited to the financial condition of our customers store closings by retailers changes in the retail environment and our decision to continue or support new and existing products 

  

in the ordinary course of business we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions based upon the evaluation of accounts receivable aging specific exposures and historical trends our allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net earnings the allowance for doubtful accounts was 414 million and 263 million as of june 30 2009 and 2008 respectively the allowance for doubtful accounts was reduced by 141 million 102 million and 182 million for customer deductions and writeoffs in fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively and increased by 292 million 132 million and 144 million for additional provisions in fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

  

inventory 

we state our inventory at the lower of cost or fair market value with cost being determined on the firstin firstout fifo method we believe fifo most closely matches the flow of our products from manufacture through sale the reported net value of our inventory includes saleable products promotional products raw materials and componentry and work in process that will be sold or used in future periods inventory cost includes raw materials direct labor and overhead as well as inbound freight manufacturing overhead is allocated to the cost of inventory based on the normal production capacity unallocated overhead during periods of abnormally low production levels are recognized as cost of sales in the period in which they are incurred 

  

  

we also record an inventory obsolescence reserve which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated realizable value based on various product sales projections this reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales in addition and as necessary we may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events 

  

pension and other postretirement benefit costs 

we offer the following benefits to some or all of our employees a domestic trustbased noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan “us qualified plan” and an unfunded nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations collectively with the us qualified plan the “domestic plans” a domestic contributory defined contribution plan international pension plans which vary by country consisting of both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans deferred compensation arrangements and certain other postretirement benefit plans 

  

the amounts needed to fund future payouts under these plans are subject to numerous assumptions and variables certain significant variables require us to make assumptions that are within our control such as an anticipated discount rate expected rate of return on plan assets and future compensation levels we evaluate these assumptions with our actuarial advisors and select assumptions that we believe reflect the economics underlying our pension and postretirement obligations while we believe these assumptions are within accepted industry ranges an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a direct impact on reported net earnings 

  

the discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated longterm bonds for fiscal 2009 we used a discount rate for our domestic plans of 675 and varying rates on our international plans of between 200 and 900 the discount rate for our domestic plans is based on a bond portfolio that includes only longterm bonds with an aa rating or equivalent from a major rating agency we believe the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio is expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of our domestic plans for fiscal 2009 we used an expected return on plan assets of 775 for our us qualified plan and varying rates of between 325 and 900 for our international plans in determining the longterm rate of return for a plan we consider the historical rates of return the nature of the plan’s investments and an expectation for the plan’s investment strategies the us qualified plan asset allocation as of june 30 2009 was approximately 32 equity investments 51 debt securities and 17 other investments the asset allocation of our combined international plans as of june 30 2009 was approximately 19 equity investments 59 debt securities and 22 other investments the difference between actual and expected return on plan assets is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income those gainslosses that are subject to amortization over future periods will be recognized as a component of the net periodic benefit cost in such future periods for fiscal 2009 our pension plans had actual negative return on assets of 605 million as compared with expected return on assets of 522 million which resulted in a net deferred loss of 1127 million of which approximately 48 million is currently subject to be amortized over periods ranging from approximately 4 to 22 years the actual negative return on assets was primarily related to the performance of equity markets during the past fiscal year 

  

a 25 basispoint change in the discount rate or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have had the following effect on fiscal 2009 pension expense 

  

   

our postretirement plans are comprised of health care plans that could be impacted by health care cost trend rates which may have a significant effect on the amounts reported a onepercentagepoint change in assumed health care cost trend rates for fiscal 2009 would have had the following effects 

  

   

for fiscal 2010 we are using a discount rate for the domestic plans of 650 and varying rates for our international plans of between 175 and 875 we are using an expected return on plan assets of 775 for the us qualified plan and varying rates for our international pension plans of between 275 and 875 the net change in these assumptions from those used in fiscal 2009 will result in an increase in pension expense of approximately 15 million in fiscal 2010 we will continue to monitor the market conditions relative to these assumptions and adjust them accordingly 

  

  

goodwill intangible assets and other longlived assets 

goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets other indefinitelived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized 

  

we assess goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles at least annually for impairment as of the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if certain events or circumstances warrant we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which is one level below our operating segments we identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and management of each reporting unit regularly reviews the operating results of those components impairment testing is performed in two steps i we determine impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value and ii if there is an impairment we measure the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill the impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets encompasses calculating a fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value if the carrying value exceeds the fair value impairment is recorded 

  

testing goodwill for impairment requires us to estimate fair values of reporting units using significant estimates and assumptions  the assumptions made will impact the outcome and ultimate results of the testing we use industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and in certain instances we engage thirdparty valuation specialists to advise us to determine fair value of the reporting unit we generally use an equal weighting of the income and market approaches in certain circumstances equal weighting will not be applied if one of these methods may be less reliable eg only the income approach would be used for reporting units with existing negative margins we believe both approaches are equally relevant and the most reliable indications of fair value because the fair value of product or service companies is more dependent on the ability to generate earnings than on the value of the assets used in the production process 

  

under the income approach we determine fair value using a discounted cash flow method estimating future cash flows of each reporting unit as well as terminal value and discounting such cash flows at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows 

  

under the market approach we utilize information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units which creates valuation multiples that are applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested to value the reporting unit 

  

the key estimates and factors used in these two approaches include but are not limited to revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts terminal value the weightedaverage cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and comparable market multiples the fiscal 2009 compound annual growth rate of sales for the first eight years of our projections ranged between 6 and 19 with the higher growth rates in those reporting units that start with the smallest base in fiscal 2009 the fiscal 2008 compound annual growth rate of sales for the first five years of our projections ranged between 10 and 21 with the higher growth rates in those reporting units that start with the smallest base in fiscal 2008 f or reporting units with positive earnings growth in the corresponding earnings before interest and taxes ranged from 6 to 46 in fiscal 2009 as compared with 10 to 31 in fiscal 2008 the terminal growth rates were projected at 3 after eight years in fiscal 2009 as compared with 3 after five years in fiscal 2008 which reflects our estimate of long term market and gross domestic product growth the weightedaverage cost of capital used to discount future cash flows ranged from 11 to 17 in fiscal 2009 as compared with 10 to 15 in fiscal 2008 the range of market multiples used in our fiscal 2009 impairment testing was from 2 to 3 times trailingtwelvemonth sales and 10 times trailingtwelvemonth earnings before interest taxes and depreciation and amortization the range of market multiples used in our fiscal 2008 impairment testing was from 2 to 3 times trailingtwelvemonth sales and 11 to 14 times trailingtwelvemonth earnings before interest taxes and depreciation and amortization future changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the results of our reviews for impairment of goodwill however a decrease of 30 basis points in our terminal growth rate or an increase of 30 basis points in our weightedaverage cost of capital would still result in a fair value calculation exceeding our book value for each of our reporting units changes in the valuation assumptions from those used in the prior year primarily reflect the impact of the current economic environment on the reporting units and their projected future results of operations 

  

to determine fair value of other indefinitelived intangible assets we use an income approach the relieffromroyalty method this method assumes that in lieu of ownership a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to obtain the rights to use the comparable asset other indefinitelived intangible assets’ fair values require significant judgments in determining both the assets’ estimated cash flows as well as the appropriate discount and royalty rates applied to those cash flows to determine fair value changes in such estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results 

  

we review other longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable when such events or changes in circumstances occur a recoverability test is performed comparing projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset or asset group to its carrying value if the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value an impairment would be recorded for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value which is determined by discounting future cash flows 

  

  

as the duration and magnitude of the volatility of the current economic conditions remain uncertain we will continue to monitor and evaluate the potential impact on our business and on our interim and annual impairment testing accordingly it is possible that we would recognize an impairment charge in the future with respect to goodwill intangible assets and other longlived assets 

  

income taxes 

we account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns as of june 30 2009 we have current net deferred tax assets of 2027 million and noncurrent net deferred tax assets of 1560 million the net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization as well as the continued application of currently anticipated tax rates included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance of 235 million for deferred tax assets where management believes it is morelikelythannot that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the relevant jurisdiction based on our assessments no additional valuation allowance is required if we determine that a deferred tax asset will not be realizable an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will result in a reduction of net earnings at that time 

  

we provide tax reserves for federal state local and international exposures relating to periods subject to audit the development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues potential outcomes and timing and is a subjective critical estimate we assess our tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting dates for those tax positions where it is morelikelythannot that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those tax positions where it is not morelikelythannot that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements we classify applicable interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes although the outcome relating to these exposures is uncertain in management’s opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating from these exposures in certain circumstances the ultimate outcome of exposures and risks involves significant uncertainties which render them inestimable if actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates they could have a material impact on our results of operations 

  

derivatives 

we address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments we primarily enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates and interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on our aggregate liability portfolio we also enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes hedge effectiveness is documented assessed and monitored by employees who are qualified to make such assessments and monitor the instruments variables that are external to us such as social political and economic risks may have an impact on our hedging program and the results thereof 

  

our derivative financial instruments are recorded as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measured at fair value all derivatives outstanding as of june 30 2009 are i designated as a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment “fairvalue” hedge ii designated as a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability “foreign currency cashflow” hedge or iii not designated as a hedging instrument changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a fairvalue hedge that is highly effective are recorded in currentperiod earnings along with the loss or gain on the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk including losses or gains on firm commitments changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a foreign currency cashflow hedge of a foreigncurrencydenominated forecasted transaction that is highly effective are recorded in other comprehensive income loss “oci” gains and losses deferred in oci are then recognized in currentperiod earnings when earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged foreigncurrencydenominated forecasted transaction eg when periodic settlements on a variablerate asset or liability are recorded in earnings changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are reported in currentperiod earnings 

  

for a discussion on the quantitative impact of market risks related to our derivative financial instruments refer to “ liquidity and capital resources — market risk” 

  

quantitative analysis 

during the threeyear period ended june 30 2009 there have not been material changes in the assumptions underlying these critical accounting policies nor to the related significant estimates the results of our business underlying these assumptions have not differed significantly from our expectations 

  

  

while we believe that the estimates that we have made are proper and the related results of operations for the period are presented fairly in all material respects other assumptions could reasonably be justified that would change the amount of reported net sales cost of sales operating expenses or our provision for income taxes as they relate to the provisions for anticipated sales returns allowance for doubtful accounts inventory obsolescence reserve and income taxes for fiscal 2009 had these estimates been changed simultaneously by 25 in either direction our reported gross profit would have increased or decreased by approximately 50 million operating expenses would have changed by approximately 10 million and the provision for income taxes would have increased or decreased by approximately 29 million the collective impact of these changes on operating income net earnings and net earnings per diluted common share would be an increase or decrease of approximately 60 million 89 million and 04 respectively 

  

results of operations 

  

overview 

  

global economic challenges and uncertainties have had a significant impact on our business during fiscal 2009 these challenges and uncertainties have negatively affected consumer demand which is having an adverse impact on our customers that are retailers as well as on our own retail stores these events have led to significant retailer destocking and changes in their ordering patterns for the products that we sell which has contributed to the overall decline in our results of operations during this year 

  

in the americas region the us department store channel experienced a very soft retail environment which deteriorated beyond our expectations while our business continues to suffer from lower store traffic and destocking we believe that we gained share in the skin care category at us department stores with the help of positive consumer response to new product offerings and gift sets net sales results in alternative channels were generally mixed trends at our freestanding retail stores followed those in department stores while sales of our products online and via direct response television “drtv” continued to grow 

  

global economic uncertainty has also impacted our business in europe the middle east  africa net sales in many of our key markets declined during fiscal 2009 our business was also impacted by retailer destocking and tighter working capital management sales and profits in our travel retail business fell sharply due to a slowdown in passenger traffic retailer destocking and the impact of weaker currencies 

  

at this time our business in the asiapacific region has been least affected by the global financial crisis with net sales rising double digits in several countries although growth in the region has slowed overall including in japan our largest market there net sales in china grew at a faster pace than in the other countries in the region as we continue our expansion in this emerging market strong constant currency net sales increases in korea were offset by the weakness of the korean won despite the overall net sales increase in this region growth has been tempered by a softer retail environment 

  

in addition to the ongoing global financial crisis our business has been negatively impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates caused by the dramatic strengthening of the us dollar during fiscal 2009 if the us dollar strengthens there would be an adverse impact on our future results 

  

we are taking actions to mitigate the impact of these economic conditions we believe that the best way to increase stockholder value is to provide our customers and consumers with the products and services that they have come to expect from us in the most efficient and profitable manner while recognizing their changing shopping habits to achieve our goal to be the global leader in prestige beauty we are implementing a longterm strategy to guide the company through fiscal 2013 the plan has numerous initiatives across regions product categories brands and functions that are designed to leverage our strengths make us more cost efficient and grow our sales 

  

as part of our strategy we plan to shift our category mix towards higher margin categories with greater global growth potential skin care our most profitable category is a strategic priority for our innovation and investment spending particularly in the asiapacific region we also plan to strengthen our geographic presence by seeking share growth in large imagebuilding cities within core markets such as the united states the united kingdom france italy and japan in addition we will continue to prioritize efforts to expand our presence and accelerate share growth in emerging markets such as china russia the middle east and eastern europe while we expect the retail environment in north america to continue to be challenging we recognize the need to restore profitable growth in our traditional department store channel we have recently implemented changes to reshape our organization to meet the needs of the changing retail landscape internationally we plan to achieve profitable growth in european perfumeries and pharmacies and in department stores in asia while accentuating our makeup and skin care initiatives to boost our travel retail business in addition we will continue our efforts to grow our business online and through drtv to optimize our portfolio we will focus on improving our margins and share in our distribution channels we plan to reenergize certain of our brands through the introduction of products that feature advances in research and technology at the same time we will be investing in initiatives to incubate and develop next generation products and brands as well as evaluating the viability of certain existing brands and products we intend to leverage our regional organizations to increase effectiveness and efficiencies while utilizing strategic partnerships alliances and licensing to build scale in research and development distribution and third party manufacturing 

  

  

charges associated with restructuring activities 

in an effort to drive down costs and achieve synergies within our organization in february 2009 we announced the implementation of a multifaceted cost savings program the “program” to position the company to achieve longterm profitable growth we anticipate the program will result in related restructuring and other special charges in fiscal 2009 and over the next few fiscal years totaling between 350 million and 450 million before taxes we expect that the implementation of this program combined with other ongoing cost savings efforts will result in savings of approximately 450 million to 550 million beginning with approximately 175 million to 200 million in fiscal 2010 including the reduction of certain costs relative to an assumed normalized spending pattern our longrange forecast for operating margin reflects these anticipated savings net of strategic reinvestments 

  

the program focuses on a redesign of our organizational structure in order to integrate the company in a more cohesive way and operate more globally across brands and functions the principal aspect of the program is the reduction of the workforce by approximately 2000 employees specific actions taken during fiscal 2009 included 

  

·   resize and reorganize the organization — we began our realignment and optimization of our organization to better leverage scale improve productivity and reduce complexity in each region and across various functions this included reduction of the workforce which occurred through the consolidation of certain functions through a combination of normal attrition and job eliminations and a rationalization of manufacturing capacity via the scheduled closure of one of our manufacturing and assembly plants 

  

·   exit unprofitable operations — to improve the profitability in certain of our brands and regions we have selectively exited certain channels of distribution categories and markets in doing so we incurred costs to reduce workforce terminate contracts write off fixed assets and discontinue certain product lines and stockkeeping units 

  

·   outsourcing — in order to balance the growing need for information technology support with our efforts to provide the most efficient and cost effective solutions we initiated the outsourcing of certain information technology processes we incurred costs to eliminate certain related headcount and to transition services to an outsource provider 

  

for the year ended june 30 2009 aggregate restructuring charges of 703 million were recorded in our consolidated statements of earnings related to the program these charges primarily reflected employeerelated costs asset writeoffs contract terminations and other exit costs 

  

the following table presents the restructuring activity as of and for the year ended june 30 2009 under the program 

  

   

accrued restructuring charges at june 30 2009 are expected to result in cash expenditures funded from cash provided by operations of approximately 48 million 6 million and 1 million in fiscal 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively 

  

the total amount of restructuring charges incurred plus other initiatives approved through june 30 2009 include approximately 75 million for employeerelated costs approximately 6 million in asset writeoffs and approximately 8 million of contract terminations and other exit costs 

  

we incurred other special charges in connection with the implementation of the program for the year ended june 30 2009 of 101 million related to consulting other professional services and accelerated depreciation the total amount of other special charges expected to be incurred to implement these initiatives including those incurred through june 30 2009 is approximately 36 million in addition to the other special charges we recorded 81 million reflecting sales returns less a related cost of sales of 12 million and a writeoff of inventory associated with exiting unprofitable operations of 80 million 

  

  

during the year ended june 30 2009 we recorded a gain of 36 million related to excess accruals that were recorded as other special charges in prior years 

  

total charges associated with restructuring activities included in operating income for the year ended june 30 2009 were 917 million 

  

while our business strategies are designed to strengthen the company over the longterm we believe the uncertainty about future market conditions consumer spending patterns and the financial strength of some of our retail customers coupled with retailer destocking and tighter working capital management will continue to negatively affect our net sales and operating results in line with our strategic plan we will continue to seek ways to contain costs and reduce our inventory levels 

  

we manufacture market and sell beauty products including those in the skin care makeup fragrance and hair care categories which are distributed in over 140 countries and territories the following table is a comparative summary of operating results from continuing operations for fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 and reflects the basis of presentation described in note 2 and note 20 to the notes to consolidated financial statements for all periods presented products and services that do not meet our definition of skin care makeup fragrance and hair care have been included in the “other” category 

  

   

  

the following table presents certain consolidated earnings data as a percentage of net sales 

  

   

in order to meet the demands of consumers we continually introduce new products support new and established products through advertising sampling and merchandising and phase out existing products that no longer meet the needs of our consumers the economics of developing producing launching and supporting products influence our sales and operating performance each period the introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products which we take into account in our business planning 

  

fiscal 2009 as compared with fiscal 2008 

  

net sales   net sales decreased 7 or 5870 million to 73238 million reflecting declines in each of our major product categories net sales decreases in europe the middle east  africa and the americas reflected customer destocking in all of our major product categories these declines were partially offset by growth in asiapacific excluding the 3894 million impact of foreign currency translation net sales decreased 2 the following discussions of net sales by product categories and geographic regions exclude the impact of returns associated with restructuring activities of 81 million incurred in fiscal 2009 we believe the following analysis of net sales better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business 

  

product categories   skin care 

  

net sales of skin care products decreased 4 or 1108 million to 28860 million primarily reflecting declines in net sales from our heritage brands despite the difficult economic environment and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation we continued to enhance select product lines to address the needs of our consumers the recent launches of perfectionist cp wrinkle lifting serum and the new time zone line of moisturizing products from estée lauder and superdefense spf 25 age defense moisturizer and youth surge spf 15 age decelerating moisturizer from clinique contributed incremental sales of approximately 181 million combined while these new product launches contributed favorably to the category they were partially offset by lower sales from other existing products in the perfectionist idealist and renutriv lines from estée lauder and the superdefense and repairwear lines from clinique of approximately 163 million combined net sales of most other product lines in this category also experienced declines particularly in europe the middle east  africa and the americas partially offset by doubledigit growth in asiapacific excluding the impact of foreign currency translation skin care net sales increased 2 

  

  

makeup 

  

makeup net sales decreased 6 or 1695 million to 28309 million primarily reflecting lower net sales from our heritage brands of approximately 162 million lower net sales in the makeup product category also reflected a net decrease from our makeup artist brands of approximately 14 million driven by the americas region partially offset by additional points of distribution internationally these declines were mitigated in part by recent product launches of reformulated superfit makeup and high impact lip colour spf 15 from clinique as well as estée lauder signature blush which contributed incremental sales to the category of approximately 82 million combined excluding the impact of foreign currency translation makeup net sales decreased 1 

  

fragrance 

  

net sales of fragrance products decreased 20 or 2811 million to 11509 million this decline was largely due to lower sales of designer fragrances of which approximately 181 million was attributable to certain dkny tommy hilfiger and sean john fragrances also contributing to the decrease were lower sales of certain estée lauder and clinique fragrances of approximately 132 million combined the recent launches of estée lauder sensuous hilfiger men the new dkny men fragrance and i am king sean john partially offset these declines by collectively contributing sales of approximately 88 million to the category excluding the impact of foreign currency translation fragrance net sales decreased 14 

  

hair care 

  

hair care net sales decreased 6 or 247 million to 4024 million primarily reflecting a soft salon retail environment and a reduction in points of distribution in the united states net sales were also negatively impacted as a result of the conclusion of a hotel amenities program in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 these declines were partially offset by incremental sales of approximately 13 million from new products such as dry remedy shampoo and conditioner and the sun care line of products from aveda the category also benefited from improved sales of hair color products as well as an increase in points of distribution outside of the united states including the acquisition of an independent distributor in australia excluding the impact of foreign currency translation hair care net sales decreased 3 

  

geographic regions 

  

net sales in the americas decreased 8 or 2903 million to 34212 million lower net sales in the united states from our heritage and makeup artist brands as well as our hair care businesses contributed approximately 275 million to the decrease net sales declines in canada of approximately 36 million were partially offset by growth in latin america of approximately 3 million net sales in these markets reflected the adverse impact of the strengthening of the us dollar economic conditions in the americas region particularly in the department store channel have negatively impacted our businesses ongoing challenges faced by certain of our department store customers in the united states may continue to affect our net sales for the short and medium term excluding the impact of foreign currency translation net sales in the americas decreased 7 

  

in europe the middle east  africa net sales decreased 13 or 3954 million to 26113 million primarily reflecting the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation net sales decreases of approximately 323 million were driven by the united kingdom our travel retail business spain france and italy these performances reflected retailer destocking and tighter working capital management by certain key retailers net sales in our travel retail business also declined due to a significant slowdown in passenger traffic and the impact of weaker currencies in certain key markets partially offsetting these decreases were higher net sales of approximately 11 million in the middle east and israel excluding the impact of foreign currency translation net sales in europe the middle east  africa decreased 4 

  

net sales in asiapacific increased 9 or 1068 million to 12994 million reflecting higher net sales of approximately 109 million in china japan and hong kong net sales growth in china and hong kong benefited from the launches of new skin care products while japan’s increase was generated from the strengthening of the japanese yen partially offsetting these increases were lower net sales of approximately 13 million in australia new zealand and korea reflecting the strengthening of the us dollar against their respective local currencies despite the overall net sales increase in this region growth has been tempered by a softer retail environment excluding the impact of foreign currency translation asiapacific net sales increased 14 

  

we believe the unfavorable global economic conditions will continue to adversely impact our financial performance we cannot predict with certainty the magnitude or duration of the impact or how it will vary across each of our geographic regions 

  

we strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market which may account for differences in regional sales growth 

  

  

cost of sales   cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales increased to 257 as compared with 252 in the prior year this change reflected an increase in obsolescence charges of approximately 40 basis points excess overhead costs that were not recovered due to lower production levels of approximately 30 basis points and the negative effect of exchange rates of approximately 20 basis points the increase in cost of sales margin also reflected the fiscal 2009 impact of charges associated with restructuring activities and an increase in the level and timing of promotional activities of approximately 10 basis points each partially offsetting these increases were favorable changes in the mix of our business and from other manufacturing variances of approximately 50 basis points and 10 basis points respectively 

  

since certain promotional activities are a component of sales or cost of sales and the timing and level of promotions vary with our promotional calendar we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in the cost of sales percentage in addition future cost of sales mix may be impacted by the inclusion of new brands or channels of distribution which have margin and product cost structures different from those of our current mix of business 

  

operating expenses   operating expenses increased to 686 of net sales as compared with 645 of net sales in the prior year in light of the current economic conditions we continued to apply various costcontainment measures to maintain expenses in line with our business needs while the implementation of these initiatives helped reduce total operating expenses as compared with the prior year the dramatic decline in net sales during fiscal 2009 was the principal factor that negatively impacted our operating expense margin in addition to the decline in net sales operating expense margin increased by approximately 110 basis points due to charges associated with restructuring activities as previously discussed 

  

during fiscal 2009 we evaluated our goodwill intangible assets and other longlived assets based upon certain triggering events as well as our annual impairment test of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets inclusive of the impairment charges incurred during the third quarter of fiscal 2009 we recorded impairment charges of approximately 14 million related to goodwill approximately 23 million related to trademarks with indefinite lives approximately 17 million related to other amortizable intangible assets and approximately 9 million related to property plant and equipment for the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 the principal factors that contributed to these impairment charges were lower than expected operating cash flow performance relative to the reporting unit andor affected assets being tested and the impact of the current economic environment on their projected future results of operations   collectively these charges resulted in an increase to our operating expense margin of approximately 90 basis points for further detailed discussion refer to note 4 and note 5 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  

despite a reduction in actual selling advertising merchandising and sampling spending operating expense margin increased by approximately 60 basis points driven by the decline in consumer demand in the current economic environment changes in advertising merchandising and sampling spending result from the type timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts as well as the markets being emphasized 

  

other factors that contributed to the increase in operating expense margin were higher costs of global information technology systems and infrastructure of approximately 50 basis points net losses from foreign exchange transactions of approximately 40 basis points and charges resulting from the degradation of the businesses of certain of our retail customers of approximately 20 basis points 

  

operating results   operating income decreased 48 or 3923 million to 4184 million operating margin decreased to 57 of net sales as compared with 103 in the prior year reflecting our lower gross margin and the increase in our operating expense margin as previously discussed the following discussions of operating results by product categories and geographic regions exclude the impact of total charges associated with restructuring activities of 917 million or 13 of net sales we believe the following analysis of operating results better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business 

  

product categories 

  

fragrance operating results decreased over 100 or 970 million to an operating loss of 608 million primarily reflecting lower net sales of designer fragrance products and certain fragrances from our heritage brands as well as a charge for intangible asset impairment which were partially offset by a reduction in selling advertising merchandising and sampling spending hair care operating income decreased 90 or 104 million to 11 million primarily reflecting lower net sales and a charge for intangible asset impairment skin care operating income decreased 27 or 1115 million to 2941 million and makeup operating income decreased 22 or 796 million to 2798 million the reduced operating results for the skin care and makeup categories primarily reflected the decline in net sales and charges for goodwill intangible asset and other longlived asset impairments as well as the majority of the impact of the excess overhead charge loss from foreign exchange transactions and certain other operating expenses as described above 

  

  

geographic regions 

  

operating income in the americas decreased 50 or 1131 million to 1152 million this decline reflected charges for goodwill intangible asset and other longlived asset impairments the majority of the impact of the excess overhead charge and the charge related to the degradation of a certain retailer of approximately 66 million combined also contributing to the decline were lower sales experienced by the majority of our businesses in the region due to current economic conditions partially offset by cost containment and contingency plan efforts 

  

in europe the middle east  africa operating income decreased 47 or 2034 million to 2297 million this decrease primarily reflected lower results of approximately 156 million in our travel retail business spain france russia the united kingdom and italy of which approximately 34 million related to charges for goodwill and intangible asset impairments and the degradation of certain retailers 

  

in asiapacific operating income increased 10 or 155 million to 1652 million most of our affiliates in this region experienced an increase despite a softer retail environment in certain countries approximately 20 million of this increase was generated in hong kong china korea and japan partially offsetting these improvements were lower results in australia singapore and new zealand of approximately 5 million combined 

  

interest expense net   

net interest expense was 757 million as compared with 668 million in the prior year interest expense increased primarily due to higher average debt balances which include an additional 3000 million of senior notes issued in november 2008 partially offset by lower average interest rates on preexisting borrowings in addition interest income decreased primarily due to lower average investment rates 

  

provision for income taxes   

the provision for income taxes represents federal foreign state and local income taxes the effective rate differs from statutory rates due to the effect of state and local income taxes tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and certain nondeductible expenses our effective tax rate will change from year to year based on recurring and nonrecurring factors including but not limited to the geographical mix of earnings enacted tax legislation state and local income taxes tax audit settlements and the interaction of various global tax strategies 

  

the effective rate for income taxes for the year ended june 30 2009 was 338 as compared with 349 in the prior year the decrease in the effective income tax rate of 110 basis points was primarily attributable to a favorable settlement with the appeals division of the irs 560 basis points partially offset by an increase in nondeductible expenses and an increase in state and local income tax expense 450 basis points 

  

net earnings   

net earnings as compared with fiscal 2008 decreased 54 or 2554 million to 2184 million and diluted net earnings per common share declined 54 from 240 to 110 these results include the impact of total charges associated with restructuring activities of 617 million after tax or 31 per diluted common share 

  

fiscal 2008 as compared with fiscal 2007 

  

net sales   

net sales increased 12  or 8733 million to 79108 million reflecting net sales growth in all of our product categories within each geographic region skin care makeup and fragrance net sales increases were led by europe the middle east  africa while most of the net sales increase in hair care was achieved in the americas the increase in net sales reflected our efforts to capitalize on growth opportunities internationally excluding the impact of foreign currency translation net sales increased 8 

  

  

product categories 

  

skin care 

  

net sales of skin care products increased 15 or 3958 million to 29968 million this growth reflected the launches of idealist pore minimizing skin refinisher cyber white ex and hydra bright skin tone perfecting moisturizers from estée lauder also contributing to the growth were the recent launches of products in the acne solutions clear skin system redness solutions and even better skin tone corrector from clinique as well as the eye concentrate and the moisturizing gel cream from la mer collectively these new products resulted in incremental sales of approximately 215 million net sales increases from renutriv and resilience lift extreme ultra firming products from estée lauder products in clinique’s 3step skin care system and repairwear line and triaktiline™ instant deep wrinkle filler from good skin™ totaled approximately 80 million these improvements were partially offset by approximately 55 million of lower sales from certain other existing idealist products and perfectionist products from estée lauder net sales of other new and existing products also significantly contributed to the growth excluding the impact of foreign currency translation skin care net sales increased 10

net sales in the americas increased 4 or 1506 million to 37115 million primarily reflecting net sales growth in canada and latin america as well as the addition of the ojon brand of approximately 98 million combined additional net sales increases of approximately 65 million were attributable to our designer fragrances business and our makeup artist and hair care brands in the united states partially offsetting this growth was approximately 37 million related to weaknesses in certain of our heritage brands in the united states as a result of competitive pressures and challenges in the department store channel we believe that economic uncertainty in the united states has affected our business particularly in the department store channel these challenges have been mitigated through sales in alternative channels such as freestanding retail stores internet distribution selfselect distribution and directresponse television excluding the impact of foreign currency translation net sales in the americas increased 3 

  

all countries in europe the middle east  africa experienced net sales growth which contributed to the increase in net sales of 21 or 5133 million to 30067 million although net sales growth rates slowed in certain key countries this growth was led by our travel retail business and the united kingdom as well as in russia which benefited from our expansion in this market the results in this region were inclusive of an exchange rate benefit due to the weakening of the us dollar of approximately 206 million excluding the impact of foreign currency translation net sales in europe the middle east  africa increased 12 

  

  

net sales in asiapacific increased 21 or 2094 million to 11926 million reflecting growth from all countries in the region this increase reflected higher net sales of approximately 172 million in china japan hong kong australia and korea the results in this region were inclusive of an exchange rate benefit due to the weakening of the us dollar of approximately 66 million excluding the impact of foreign currency translation asiapacific net sales increased 15 

  

we strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market which may account for differences in regional sales growth 

  

cost of sales   cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales was 252 which is the same as in fiscal 2007 cost of sales as a percentage of net sales reflected a decrease in the level and timing of promotional activities of approximately 20 basis points and a positive effect of exchange rates of approximately 10 basis points offsetting these improvements was an unfavorable change in the mix of our business an increase in obsolescence charges and employeerelated charges designed to streamline certain business activities and achieve future cost savings of approximately 10 basis points each 

  

despite the rise in energy and raw material prices in the current year we were able to maintain our overall cost of goods margin through other efficiencies achieved from ongoing savings initiatives 

  

since certain promotional activities are a component of sales or cost of sales and the timing and level of promotions vary with our promotional calendar we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in the cost of sales percentage in addition future cost of sales mix may be impacted by the inclusion of new brands which have margin and product cost structures different from those of our existing brands 

  

operating expenses   operating expenses increased to 645 of net sales as compared with 641 of net sales in the fiscal 2007 the increase in operating expenses and operating expense margin reflected higher costs of global information technology systems and infrastructure of approximately 30 basis points an additional 20 basis points resulted from an increase in valuation reserves reflecting the diminishing likelihood of realizing value from a promissory note and convertible preferred stock received in connection with the divestiture of stila in fiscal 2006 we also recorded an increase in intangible asset amortization resulting from recent strategic acquisitions as well as employeerelated charges designed to streamline certain business activities and achieve future cost savings of approximately 10 basis points each operating expense margin in fiscal 2007 was adversely impacted by charges related to our pharmacy channel of approximately 40 basis points 

  

changes in advertising merchandising and sampling spending result from the type timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts as well as the markets being emphasized 

  

operating results   operating income increased 8 or 608 million to 8107 million as compared with fiscal 2007 operating margin declined to 103 of net sales as compared with 107 in fiscal 2007 reflecting our constant cost of sales margin and the increase in our operating expense margin as previously discussed 

  

product categories 

  

fragrance operating income increased 29 or 81 million to 362 million reflecting profitable international growth partially offset by increased spending in support of designer fragrance products initiatives skin care operating income increased 19 or 641 million to 4056 million primarily reflecting improved international results from certain of our heritage brands and net sales growth from la mer products and triaktiline tm instant deep wrinkle filler from good skin tm  in addition the fiscal 2007 results in this category reflected organizational costs of approximately 30 million primarily related to our pharmacy channel in europe makeup operating income increased 6 or 201 million to 3594 million primarily reflecting improved results internationally these improvements were partially offset by lower results in the united states from certain of our heritage brands the charge on the impairment of stilarelated financial instruments and costs related to the establishment of new points of distribution for m ž a ž c hair care operating income declined 73 or 310 million to 115 million primarily reflecting costs related to the acquisition and integration of ojon to position the brand for future growth the results in this category also reflected an increase in intangible asset amortization resulting from fiscal 2008 strategic acquisitions as well as costs related to the establishment of new points of distribution 

  

  

geographic regions 

  

operating income in the americas declined 32 or 1081 million to 2283 million primarily reflecting a difficult retail environment in which our heritage brands faced challenges in the department store channel we also experienced significant pressure on the profitability of our hair care business as discussed above at the same time we continued to invest in our global information technology systems and infrastructure in addition we established new points of distribution for existing brands incurred costs to streamline certain business activities to generate future efficiencies and incurred a charge on the impairment of stilarelated financial instruments as discussed above 

  

in europe the middle east  africa operating income increased 35 or 1117 million to 4331 million primarily due to higher results of approximately 71 million in our travel retail business the united kingdom italy the balkans and spain partially offsetting these increases were lower results in russia and india of approximately 6 million reflecting spending to support our expansion in these markets the overall operating results in this region were adversely impacted in fiscal 2007 by the pharmacy channel charges discussed above 

  

in asiapacific operating income increased 61 or 565 million to 1497 million all of our affiliates in this region experienced an increase in operating income primarily resulting from net sales growth led by japan hong kong china australia and korea which contributed approximately 43 million collectively 

  

interest expense net   

net interest expense was 668 million as compared with 389 million in fiscal 2007 this change primarily resulted from higher average debt balances including an additional 6000 million of senior notes issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 partially offset by lower average interest rates 

  

provision for income taxes   

the provision for income taxes represents federal foreign state and local income taxes the effective rate differs from statutory rates due to the effect of state and local taxes tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and certain nondeductible expenses our effective tax rate will change from year to year based on nonrecurring and recurring factors including but not limited to the geographical mix of earnings enacted tax legislation state and local taxes tax audit settlements and the interaction of various global tax strategies the effective rate for income taxes for the year ended june 30 2008 was 349 as compared with 359 in fiscal 2007 the decrease in the effective income tax rate of 100 basis points resulted primarily from a decrease in state and local income tax expense 240 basis points partially offset by an increase in the tax effect of our foreign operations 140 basis points 

  

net earnings   

net earnings as compared with fiscal 2007 increased 5 or 246 million to 4738 million and diluted net earnings per common share improved 11 from 216 to 240 

  

financial condition 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

overview 

  

our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program borrowings from the issuance of longterm debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks and other lenders in the united states and abroad at june 30 2009 we had cash and cash equivalents of 8645 million compared with 4017 million at june 30 2008   our cash and cash equivalents are maintained at a number of financial institutions as of june 30 2009 approximately 10 of the total balance is insured by governmental agencies to mitigate the risk of uninsured balances we select financial institutions based on their credit ratings and financial strength and perform ongoing evaluations of these institutions to limit our concentration risk exposure 

  

our business is seasonal in nature and accordingly our working capital needs vary from time to time we may enter into investing and financing transactions that require additional funding to the extent that these needs exceed cash from operations we could subject to market conditions issue commercial paper issue longterm debt securities or borrow under our revolving credit facilities 

  

during fiscal 2009 we have been able to issue commercial paper in amounts and with terms that we deem acceptable we do not anticipate protracted difficulties in securing this form of working capital financing however in order to maintain sufficient cash reserves over a longer period of time in light of the current macroeconomic conditions and the real or perceived lack of available credit we issued 3000 million of 775 senior notes due november 1 2013 during the second quarter of fiscal 2009 the net proceeds were used to repay thenoutstanding commercial paper balances upon their maturity 

  

  

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that cash on hand cash generated from operations available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business operations information systems enhancements capital expenditures potential stock repurchases commitments and other contractual obligations on both a nearterm and longterm basis 

  

the effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years generally we have been able to introduce new products at higher selling prices or increase selling prices sufficiently to offset cost increases which have been moderate 

  

debt 

  

at june 30 2009 our outstanding borrowings were as follows 

  

   

   

we have a 7500 million commercial paper program under which we may issue commercial paper in the united states our commercial paper is currently rated a1 by standard  poor’s and p1 by moody’s our longterm credit ratings are a with a negative outlook by standard  poor’s and a2 with a negative outlook by moody’s at june 30 2009 there was no commercial paper outstanding we also have 2014 million in additional uncommitted credit facilities of which 163 million was used as of june 30 2009 

  

we have an undrawn 7500 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on april 26 2012 this facility may be used primarily to provide credit support for our commercial paper program to repurchase shares of our common stock and for general corporate purposes up to the equivalent of 250 million of the credit facility is available for multicurrency loans the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on libor or on the higher of prime which is the rate of interest publicly announced by the administrative agent or ½ plus the federal funds rate we incurred costs of approximately 03 million to establish the facility which will be amortized over the term of the facility the credit facility has an annual fee of 04 million payable quarterly based on our current credit ratings this facility also contains a crossdefault provision whereby a failure to pay other material financial obligations in excess of 500 million after grace periods and absent a waiver from the lenders would result in an event of default and the acceleration of the maturity of any outstanding debt under this facility as of june 30 2009 we were in compliance with all related financial and other restrictive covenants including limitations on indebtedness and liens and expect continued compliance the financial covenant of this facility requires an interest expense coverage ratio of greater than 31 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter the interest expense coverage ratio is defined in the credit agreement as the ratio of consolidated ebitda which does not represent a measure of our operating results as defined under us generally accepted accounting principles to consolidated interest expense and is calculated as stipulated in the agreement as follows 

  

  

   

   

in november 2008 we issued and sold 3000 million of 775 senior notes due november 1 2013 “775 senior notes due 2013” in a public offering the 775 senior notes due 2013 were priced at 99932 with a yield of 7767 interest payments are required to be made semiannually on may 1 and november 1 commencing may 1 2009 the net proceeds of this offering were used to repay thenoutstanding commercial paper balances upon their maturity 

  

the purchase price related to the july 2007 acquisition of ojon corporation included i a promissory note due july 31 2009 with a notional value of 70 million and capitalized interest of 07 million present value of 77 million at june 30 2009 bearing interest at 1000 due at maturity and ii a promissory note due august 31 2012 with a notional amount of 135 million and unamortized premium of 17 million present value of 152 million at june 30 2009 bearing interest at 1000 payable annually on july 31 these notes were recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at present value using effective rates of 511 and 542 respectively the note due july 31 2009 and the related interest thereon was paid subsequent to yearend upon maturity 

  

we have a fixed rate promissory note agreement with a financial institution pursuant to which we may borrow up to 1500 million in the form of loan participation notes through one of our subsidiaries in europe the interest rate on borrowings under this agreement is at an allin fixed rate determined by the lender and agreed to by us at the date of each borrowing at june 30 2009 no borrowings were outstanding under this agreement debt issuance costs incurred related to this agreement were de minimis 

  

we have an overdraft borrowing agreement with a financial institution pursuant to which our subsidiary in turkey may be credited to satisfy outstanding negative daily balances arising from its business operations the total balance outstanding at any time shall not exceed 300 million turkish lira 196 million at the exchange rate at june 30 2009 the interest rate applicable to each such credit shall be up to a maximum of 175 basis points per annum above the spot rate charged by the lender or the lender’s floating call rate agreed to by us at each borrowing there were no debt issuance costs incurred related to this agreement the outstanding balance at june 30 2009 125 million at the exchange rate at june 30 2009 is classified as shortterm debt in our consolidated balance sheet subsequent to yearend the borrowing authorization under this facility was increased to 400 million turkish lira 261 million at the exchange rate at june 30 2009 

  

our 30 billion japanese yen revolving credit facility expired on march 24 2009 this facility was replaced with a 15 billion japanese yen 157 million at the exchange rate at june 30 2009 revolving credit facility that expires on march 31 2010 and a 15 billion japanese yen 157 million at the exchange rate at june 30 2009 revolving credit facility that expires on march 31 2012 the interest rates on borrowings under these credit facilities are based on tibor tokyo interbank offered rate plus 45 and 75 respectively and the facility fees incurred on undrawn balances are 15 basis points and 25 basis points respectively at june 30 2009 no borrowings were outstanding under these facilities 

  

total debt as a percent of total capitalization increased to 46 at june 30 2009 from 42 at june 30 2008 primarily as a result of the issuance of the 775 senior notes due 2013 partially offset by the repayment of outstanding commercial paper balances based on our current plans we do not expect this change to have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or liquidity on both a nearterm and longterm basis 

  

  

cash flows 

  

cash and cash equivalents have increased significantly as compared with the prior year in light of economic conditions during fiscal 2009 we took a defensive approach to preserve our liquidity we issued longterm bonds and reduced share repurchases 

  

net cash provided by operating activities was 6960 million 6901 million and 6616 million in fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the increase in operating cash flows in fiscal 2009 as compared with fiscal 2008 primarily reflected a decrease in inventory due in part to ongoing planned reductions in stockkeeping units as well as lower accounts receivable as a result of lower sales and an improvement in days sales outstanding these activities were partially offset by lower net earnings and an increase in income tax receivables as compared with the prior year as well as a reduction in cash provided by certain working capital components including payments for accounts payable and other liabilities the increase in operating cash flows from fiscal 2008 as compared with fiscal 2007 primarily reflected a higher level of cash generated from net earnings before noncash items such as depreciation amortization and stockbased compensation approximately 91 million of the change in deferred income taxes was offset by a correlative change in noncurrent accrued income taxes reflecting the balance sheet presentation of unrecognized tax benefits these changes were partially offset by the timing and level of payments on trade payables in north america and higher accounts receivable levels primarily reflecting significant sales growth from our international operations which carry longer customer payment terms 

  

net cash used for investing activities was 3395 million 4785 million and 3738 million in fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 the decrease during fiscal 2009 primarily reflected lower capital expenditure activity in the current year and the prioryear acquisition of ojon corporation partially offset by the currentyear acquisitions of agi and two aveda distributors the increase in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2008 as compared with fiscal 2007 primarily reflected cash payments related to the acquisition of ojon corporation and the exclusive rights to sell and distribute ojon products worldwide and to a lesser extent the acquisition of an aveda distributor capital expenditures also increased from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 reflecting incremental spending for counters and the higher costs of technology related to our continuing companywide initiative to upgrade our information systems 

  

cash provided by financing activities was 1258 million in fiscal 2009 and cash used for financing activities was 781 million and 4116 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively the fiscal 2009 increase in cash provided by financing activities primarily reflected the issuance of the 3000 million senior notes due 2013 and a decrease in treasury stock purchases partially offset by repayments of outstanding commercial paper the fiscal 2008 increase in cash used for financing activities primarily reflected higher treasury stock repurchases in fiscal 2007 which were partially funded by the issuance of longterm debt also contributing to the change in net cash used for financing activities was an increase in outstanding commercial paper partially offset by lower cash inflows from stock option exercises 

  

dividends 

  

on november 6 2008 the board of directors declared an annual dividend of 55 per share on our class a and class b common stock of which an aggregate of 1084 million was paid on december 17 2008 to stockholders of record at the close of business on december 1 2008 the annual common stock dividend declared during fiscal 2008 was 55 per share of which an aggregate of 1066 million was paid on december 27 2007 to stockholders of record at the close of business on december 7 2007 

  

pension plan funding 

  

several factors influence the annual funding requirements for our pension plans for the us qualified plan our funding policy consists of annual contributions at a rate that provides for future plan benefits and maintains appropriate funded percentages such contribution is not less than the minimum required by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended “erisa” and subsequent pension legislation and is not more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes for each international plan our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations in addition amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions as detailed in “ critical accounting polices and estimates ” the effect of our pension plan funding on future operating results will depend on economic conditions employee demographics mortality rates the number of participants electing to take lumpsum distributions investment performance and funding decisions 

  

the unprecedented economic downturn during fiscal 2009 created a difficult investment environment for the us qualified plan we maintain an investment strategy of matching the duration of the plan assets with the duration of the underlying plan liabilities this strategy helped mitigate the negative effects of the downturn and assisted in maintaining a funded ratio of more than 100 as of june 30 2009 for fiscal 2009 and 2008 there was no minimum contribution to the us qualified plan required by erisa w e made discretionary contributions totaling 170 million and 250 million to the us qualified plan during fiscal 2009 and 2008 respectively we do not currently expect to make cash contributions to the us qualified plan during fiscal 2010 however as we continue to monitor the performance of our plan assets we may decide to make discretionary contributions 

  

  

for fiscal 2009 and 2008 we made benefit payments under our nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan of 81 million and 77 million respectively we expect to make benefit payments under this plan during fiscal 2010 of approximately 8 million for fiscal 2009 and 2008 we made cash contributions to our international defined benefit pension plans of 418 million and 353 million respectively we expect to make contributions under these plans during fiscal 2010 of approximately 32 million 

  

commitments and contingencies 

  

certain of our business acquisition agreements include “earnout” provisions these provisions generally require that we pay to the seller or sellers of the business additional amounts based on the performance of the acquired business   since the size of each payment depends upon performance of the acquired business we do not expect that such payments will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or financial condition 

  

for additional contingencies refer to “item 3 legal proceedings” 

  

contractual obligations 

  

the following table summarizes scheduled maturities of our contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed and determinable as of june 30 2009 

  

   

1   includes longterm and shortterm debt and the related projected interest costs and to a lesser extent capital lease commitments interest costs on longterm and shortterm debt are projected to be 765 million in fiscal 2010 756 million in each of fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012 607 million in fiscal 2013 476 million in fiscal 2014 and 6576 million thereafter projected interest costs on variable rate instruments were calculated using market rates at june 30 2009 refer to note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

2   minimum operating lease commitments only include base rent certain leases provide for contingent rents that are not measurable at inception and primarily include rents based on a percentage of sales in excess of stipulated levels as well as common area maintenance these amounts are excluded from minimum operating lease commitments and are included in the determination of total rent expense when it is probable that the expense has been incurred and the amount is reasonably measurable 

3   unconditional purchase obligations primarily include inventory commitments estimated future earnout payments estimated royalty payments pursuant to license agreements advertising commitments capital improvement commitments planned funding of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations commitments pursuant to executive compensation arrangements and obligations related to our cost savings initiatives future earnout payments and future royalty and advertising commitments were estimated based on planned future sales for the term that was in effect at june 30 2009 without consideration for potential renewal periods 

4   refer to note 8 of notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding unrecognized tax benefits during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we made a cash payment of 350 million to the us treasury as an advance deposit which is not reflected as a reduction to the 785 million as of june 30 2009 the noncurrent portion of our unrecognized tax benefits including related accrued interest and penalties was 2485 million at this time the settlement period for the noncurrent portion of the unrecognized tax benefits including related accrued interest and penalties cannot be determined and therefore was not included 

  

derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 

  

we address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments we primarily enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates and interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on our aggregate liability portfolio we also enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes costs associated with entering into these derivative financial instruments have not been material to our consolidated financial results 

  

  

for each derivative contract entered into where we look to obtain special hedge accounting treatment we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items as well as our riskmanagement objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction the nature of the risk being hedged how the hedging instruments’ effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively and a description of the method of measuring ineffectiveness this process includes linking all derivatives to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions we also formally assess both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items if it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge we will be required to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively 

  

foreign exchange risk management   we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge anticipated transactions as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies for periods consistent with our identified exposures the purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on costs and on the cash flows that we receive from foreign subsidiaries the majority of foreign currency forward contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries we also enter into foreign currency option contracts to hedge anticipated transactions where there is a high probability that anticipated exposures will materialize the foreign currency forward contracts entered into to hedge anticipated transactions have been designated as foreign currency cashflow hedges and have varying maturities through the end of june 2010 hedge effectiveness of foreign currency forward contracts is based on a hypothetical derivative methodology and excludes the portion of fair value attributable to the spotforward difference which is recorded in currentperiod earnings hedge effectiveness of foreign currency option contracts is based on a dollar offset methodology the ineffective portion of both foreign currency forward and option contracts is recorded in currentperiod earnings for hedge contracts that are no longer deemed highly effective hedge accounting is discontinued and gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income loss are reclassified to earnings when the underlying forecasted transaction occurs if it is probable that the forecasted transaction will no longer occur then any gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income loss are reclassified to currentperiod earnings as of june 30 2009 these foreign currency cashflow hedges were highly effective in all material respects 

  

at june 30 2009 we had foreign currency forward contracts in the amount of 12608 million the foreign currencies included in foreign currency forward contracts notional value stated in us dollars are principally the british pound 2391 million euro 2125 million swiss franc 2068 million canadian dollar 1680 million hong kong dollar 794 million japanese yen 760 million and australian dollar 696 million 

  

interest rate risk management 

  

we enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the exposure to interest rate fluctuations on our funded indebtedness and anticipated issuance of debt for periods consistent with the identified exposures we have interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount totaling 2500 million to effectively convert the fixed rate interest on our 2017 senior notes to variable interest rates based on sixmonth libor these interest rate swap agreements are designated as fair value hedges of the related longterm debt and meet the accounting criteria that permit changes in the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements to exactly offset changes in the fair value of the underlying longterm debt as of june 30 2009 these fairvalue hedges were highly effective in all material respects 

  

credit risk 

  

as a matter of policy we only enter into derivative contracts with counterparties that have at least an “a” or equivalent credit rating the counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions exposure to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to the gross fair value of contracts in asset positions which totaled 412 million at june 30 2009 to manage this risk we have established strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored and reported to management accordingly management believes risk of loss under these hedging contracts is remote 

  

certain of our derivative financial instruments contain creditriskrelated contingent features as of june 30 2009 we were in compliance with such features and there were no derivative financial instruments with creditriskrelated contingent features that were in a net liability position 

  

  

market risk 

  

we use a valueatrisk model to assess the market risk of our derivative financial instruments valueatrisk represents the potential losses for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors for a specified time period and confidence level we estimate valueatrisk across all of our derivative financial instruments using a model with historical volatilities and correlations calculated over the past 250day period the high low and average measured valueatrisk for the twelve months ended june 30 2009 and 2008 related to our foreign exchange and interest rate contracts are as follows 

  

   

the change in the valueatrisk measures from the prior year related to our foreign exchange contracts reflected an increase in foreign exchange volatilities and a different portfolio mix the change in the valueatrisk measures from the prior year related to our interest rate contracts reflected higher interest rate volatilities the model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 percent confidence level we used a statistical simulation model that valued our derivative financial instruments against one thousand randomly generated market price paths 

  

our calculated valueatrisk exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may or may not occur it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated based upon actual fluctuations in market rates operating exposures and the timing thereof and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year 

  

we believe however that any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the derivative financial instrument was intended 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

we do not maintain any offbalance sheet arrangements transactions obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations 

  

recently adopted accounting standards 

  

in may 2009 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 165 “subsequent events” “sfas no 165” sfas no 165 requires the disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements and whether that date represents the date the financial statements were issued or were available to be issued this standard also provides clarification about circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date this standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning with our fiscal year ended june 30 2009 the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in march 2008 the fasb issued sfas no 161 “disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities — an amendment of fasb statement no 133” “sfas no 161” sfas no 161 requires companies to provide qualitative disclosures about their objectives and strategies for using derivative instruments quantitative disclosures of the fair values of and gains and losses on these derivative instruments in a tabular format as well as more information about liquidity by requiring disclosure of a derivative contract’s creditriskrelated contingent features sfas no 161 also requires crossreferencing within footnotes to enable financial statement users to locate important information about derivative instruments we adopted this disclosureonly standard beginning in our fiscal 2009 third quarter 

  

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas no 157” to clarify the definition of fair value establish a framework for measuring fair value and expand the disclosures on fair value measurements sfas no 157 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date an exit price sfas no 157 also stipulates that as a marketbased measurement fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between a market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs and b the reporting entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances unobservable inputs 

  

  

in february 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position “fsp” no fas 1571 “application of fasb statement no 157 to fasb statement no 13 and other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements for purposes of lease classification or measurement under statement 13” this fsp amends sfas no 157 to exclude certain leasing transactions accounted for under previously existing accounting guidance however this scope exception does not apply to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination regardless of whether those assets and liabilities are related to leases 

  

in february 2008 the fasb issued fsp no fas 1572 “effective date for fasb statement no 157” “fsp no fas 1572” this fsp permits the delayed application of sfas no 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities as defined in this fsp except for those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements at least annually until the beginning of our fiscal 2010 as of july 1 2008 we adopted sfas no 157 with the exception of its application to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities which we will defer in accordance with fsp no fas 1572 until the beginning of fiscal 2010 nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities principally consist of intangible assets acquired through business combinations longlived assets when assessing potential impairment and liabilities associated with restructuring activities we are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions for such nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in october 2008 the fasb issued fsp no fas 1573 “determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active” “fsp no fas 1573” which clarifies the application of sfas no 157 in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active the fsp is effective upon issuance including prior periods for which financial statements have not been issued revisions resulting from a change in the valuation technique or its application should be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate following the guidance in sfas no 154 “accounting changes and error corrections” “sfas no 154” however the disclosure provisions in sfas no 154 for a change in accounting estimate are not required for revisions resulting from a change in valuation technique or its application we adopted sfas no 157 beginning in our fiscal 2009 first quarter as part of this adoption we evaluated the fair value measurements of our financial assets and liabilities and determined that these instruments are valued in active markets as such the guidance in this fsp did not impact our consolidated financial statements

in june 2009 the fasb issued sfas no 167 “amendments to fasb interpretation no 46r” “sfas no 167” sfas no 167 eliminates the exception to consolidate a qualifying specialpurpose entity changes the approach to determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and requires companies to more frequently reassess whether they must consolidate variable interest entities under the new guidance the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is identified qualitatively as the enterprise that has both a the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and b the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity sfas no 167 becomes effective for our fiscal 2011 yearend and interim reporting periods thereafter we do not expect sfas no 167 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  

  

in april 2009 the fasb issued fsp no fas 1071 and apb 281 “interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments” principally to require publicly traded companies to provide disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim financial information the adoption of this disclosureonly guidance will not have an impact on our consolidated financial results and is effective beginning with our fiscal 2010 interim period ending september 30 2009

we expect that these systems will continue to provide pertinent inventory and sales data in the short term however as part of our longterm effort to enhance these systems and increase productivity we are implementing our strategic modernization initiative “smi” which includes an enterprisewide global program that we expect will deliver a single set of integrated data processes and technologies which would be scalable and used to standardize business processes across brands operating units and sales affiliates the initial implementation of smi at our aveda operating unit occurred in may 2007 and we believe it is operating effectively we anticipate smi implementation will continue at additional primary locations in fiscal 2009 with the majority of our business to be implemented through fiscal 2012

please consider the following risks and all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k and in our subsequent filings with the securities and exchange commission “sec” our business may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial if any of the events contemplated by the following discussion of risks should occur or other risks arise or develop our business prospects financial condition and results of operations as well as the trading prices of our securities may be adversely affected 

  

the beauty business is highly competitive and if we are unable to compete effectively our results will suffer 

  

we face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world including multinational consumer product companies some of these competitors have greater resources than we do and may be able to respond to changing business and economic conditions more quickly than us competition in the beauty business is based on pricing of products innovation perceived value service to the consumer promotional activities advertising special events new product introductions electronic commerce initiatives and other activities it is difficult for us to predict the timing and scale of our competitors’ actions in these areas in particular the fragrance category in the united states is influenced by the high volume of new product introductions by diverse companies across several different distribution channels also the trend toward consolidation in the retail trade particularly in developed markets such as the united states and western europe has resulted in us becoming increasingly dependent on key retailers including largeformat retailers who have increased their bargaining strength this trend has also resulted in an increased risk related to the concentration of our customers a severe adverse impact on their business operations could have a corresponding material adverse effect on us our ability to compete also depends on the continued strength of our brands our ability to attract and retain key talent and other personnel the efficiency of our manufacturing facilities and distribution network and our ability to protect our intellectual property our inability to continue to compete effectively in countries around the world could have an adverse impact on our business 

  

our inability to anticipate and respond to market trends and changes in consumer preferences could adversely affect our financial results 

  

our continued success depends on our ability to anticipate gauge and react in a timely and costeffective manner to changes in consumer tastes for skin care makeup fragrance and hair care products as well as to where and how consumers shop for those products we must continually work to develop produce and market new products maintain and enhance the recognition of our brands achieve a favorable mix of products and refine our approach as to how and where we market and sell our products while we devote considerable effort and resources to shape analyze and respond to consumer preferences we recognize that consumer tastes cannot be predicted with certainty and can change rapidly if we are unable to anticipate and respond to trends in the market for our products and changing consumer demands our financial results will suffer 

  

our future success depends on our ability to achieve our longterm strategy 

  

our longterm strategy is based on five strategic imperatives 

  

1   optimize brand portfolio

2   strengthen product categories

3   strengthen and expand geographic presence

4   diversify and strengthen distribution channels

5   achieve operational and cost excellence

  

achieving our longterm objectives may require investment in new brands categories distribution channels technologies and geographic markets these investments may result in shortterm costs without any current revenues and therefore may be dilutive to our earnings at least in the short term in addition we may dispose of select brands or streamline operations and incur costs or onetime charges in doing so although we believe that our strategic imperatives will lead to longterm growth in revenue and profitability we may not realize in full or in part the anticipated benefits the failure to realize benefits which may be due to our ability to execute plans or other risks described herein could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

  

 12  

  

any future acquisitions may expose us to additional risks 

  

we continuously review acquisition opportunities that would expand our current product offerings our distribution channels increase the size and geographic scope of our operations or otherwise offer growth and operating efficiency opportunities if required the financing for any of these acquisitions could result in an increase in our indebtedness dilute the interests of our stockholders or both acquisitions may entail numerous risks including 

  

·   difficulties in assimilating acquired operations or products including the loss of key employees from or customers of acquired businesses

·   diversion of management’s attention from our core businesses

·   adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and

·   risks of entering distribution channels categories or markets in which we have limited or no prior experience

  

our failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate acquisitions on favorable terms 

  

a general economic downturn or sudden disruption in business conditions may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items andor the financial strength of our customers that are retailers which could adversely affect our financial results 

  

the general level of consumer spending is affected by a number of factors including general economic conditions inflation interest rates energy costs and consumer confidence generally all of which are beyond our control consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower and may impact sales of our products a decline in consumer purchases of discretionary items also tends to impact our customers that are retailers we generally extend credit to a retailer based on an evaluation of its financial condition usually without requiring collateral however the financial difficulties of a retailer could cause us to curtail or eliminate business with that customer we may also assume more credit risk relating to the receivables from that retailer our inability to collect the receivable from one of our largest customers or from a group of customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition if a retailer was to liquidate we may incur additional costs if we choose to purchase the retailer’s inventory of our products to protect brand equity 

  

in addition sudden disruptions in business conditions for example as a consequence of events such as the outbreak of sars in 2003 or those that are currently taking place in the middle east or as a result of a terrorist attack retaliation and the threat of further attacks or retaliation or as a result of adverse weather conditions or climate changes can have a short and sometimes longterm impact on consumer spending 

  

events that impact consumers’ willingness or ability to travel andor purchase our products while traveling may impact our travel retail business which is a significant contributor to our overall results 

  

a downturn in the economies in which we sell our products or a sudden disruption of business conditions in those economies could adversely affect our sales and profitability 

  

changes in laws regulations and policies that affect our business could adversely affect our financial results 

  

our business is subject to numerous laws regulations and policies changes in the laws regulations and policies including the interpretation or enforcement thereof that affect or will affect our business including changes in accounting standards tax laws and regulations trade rules and customs regulations and the outcome and expense of legal or regulatory proceedings and any action we may take as a result could adversely affect our financial results 

  

our success depends in part on the quality and safety of our products 

  

our success depends in part on the quality and safety of our products if our products are found to be defective or unsafe or if they otherwise fail to meet our consumers’ standards our relationships with customers or consumers could suffer the appeal of one or more of our brands could be diminished and we could lose sales andor become subject to liability claims any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

 13  

  

our success depends in part on our key personnel 

  

our success depends in part on our ability to retain our key personnel including our executive officers and senior management team the unexpected loss of one or more of our key employees could adversely affect our business our success also depends in part on our continuing ability to identify hire train and retain other highly qualified personnel competition for these employees can be intense we may not be able to attract assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business this risk may be exacerbated by the stresses associated with the implementation of smi as defined below and other initiatives 

  

we are subject to risks related to our international operations 

  

we operate on a global basis with approximately 59 of our fiscal 2008 net sales generated outside the united states we maintain offices in over 40 countries and have key operational facilities located outside the united states that manufacture warehouse or distribute goods for sale throughout the world foreign operations are subject to many risks and uncertainties including 

  

·   fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which can affect our results of operations the value of our foreign assets the relative prices at which we and foreign competitors sell products in the same markets and the cost of certain inventory and noninventory items required in our operations

·   changes in foreign laws regulations and policies including restrictions on trade import and export license requirements and tariffs and taxes as well as changes in united states laws and regulations relating to foreign trade and investment and

·   adverse weather conditions social economic and geopolitical conditions such as terrorist attacks war or other military action

  

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects results of operations and financial condition 

  

a disruption in operations could adversely affect our business and financial results 

  

as a company engaged in manufacturing and distribution on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including industrial accidents environmental events strikes and other labor disputes disruptions in logistics or information systems loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites product quality control safety licensing requirements and other regulatory issues as well as natural disasters and other external factors over which we have no control if such an event were to occur it could have an adverse affect on our business and financial results 

  

our information systems and websites may be susceptible to outages and other risks 

  

we have information systems that support our business processes including product development marketing sales order processing production distribution finance and intracompany communications throughout the world we have ecommerce and other internet websites in the united states and many other countries these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire floods power loss telecommunications failures breakins and similar events despite the implementation of network security measures our systems may be vulnerable to computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering the occurrence of these or other events could disrupt or damage our information systems and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

we are subject to risks associated with implementing global information systems 

  

as part of a program that we call our “strategic modernization initiative” or “smi” we are implementing enterprisewide global programs intended to deliver a single set of integrated data processes and technologies which would be scalable and used to standardize business processes across brands operating units and sales affiliates the initial implementation of smi at our aveda operating unit occurred in may 2007 we anticipate smi implementation will continue at additional primary locations in fiscal 2009 with the majority of our business to be implemented through fiscal 2012 like most entitywide changes to software systems the implementation of smi involves risks and uncertainties failure to implement smi as planned in terms of timing specifications andor costs could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

  

 14  

  

the trading prices of our securities periodically may rise or fall based on the accuracy of predictions of our earnings or other financial performance 

  

our business planning process is designed to maximize our longterm strength growth and profitability not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter we believe that this longerterm focus is in the best interests of the company and our stockholders at the same time however we recognize that it may be helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our forecast of net sales and earnings accordingly when we announced our yearend financial results for fiscal 2008 we provided guidance as to our expected net sales and earnings for the fiscal year ending june 30 2009 and the quarter ending september 30 2008 while we generally expect to provide updates to our guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter we assume no responsibility to update any of our forwardlooking statements at such times or otherwise in addition the longerterm guidance we provide is based on goals that we believe at the time guidance is given are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years such targets are more speculative than our current quarter and fiscal year expectations 

  

in all of our public statements when we make or update a forwardlooking statement about our sales andor earnings expectations we accompany such statements directly or by reference to a public document with a list of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we expect such a list is included among other places in our earnings press release and in our periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission eg in our reports on form 10k and form 10q these and other factors may make it difficult for outside observers such as research analysts to predict what our earnings will be in any given fiscal quarter or year 

  

outside analysts like all investors have the right to make their own predictions of our financial results for any future period outside analysts however have access to no more material information about our plans than any other public investor and we do not endorse their predictions as to our future performance nor do we assume any responsibility to correct the predictions of outside analysts or others when they differ from our own internal expectations if and when we announce actual results that differ from those that outside analysts or others have been predicting the market price of our securities could be affected investors who rely on the predictions of outside analysts or others when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk we take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in the prices of our securities

 item 3 legal proceedings  

  

we are involved from time to time in litigation and other legal proceedings incidental to our business management believes that the outcome of current litigation and legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial condition however management’s assessment of our current litigation and other legal proceedings could change in light of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions or other proceedings pending against us not presently known to us or determinations by judges juries or other finders of fact which are not in accord with management’s evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such litigation or proceedings 

  

in 1999 the office of the attorney general of the state of new york the “state” notified the company and ten other entities that they had been identified as potentially responsible parties “prps” with respect to the blydenburgh landfill in islip new york each prp may be jointly and severally liable for the costs of investigation and cleanup which the state estimated in 2006 to be approximately 197 million for all prps in 2001 the state sued other prps including hickey’s carting inc dennis c hickey and maria hickey collectively the “hickey parties” in the us district court for the eastern district of new york to recover such costs in connection with the site and in september 2002 the hickey parties brought contribution actions against the company and other blydenburgh prps these contribution actions seek to recover among other things any damages for which the hickey parties are found liable in the state’s lawsuit against them and related costs and expenses including attorneys’ fees in june 2004 the state added the company and other prps as defendants in its pending case against the hickey parties in april 2006 the company and other defendants added numerous other parties to the case as thirdparty defendants the company and certain other prps have engaged in settlement discussions which to date have been unsuccessful settlement negotiations with the new thirdparty defendants the state the company and other defendants began in july 2006 we have accrued an amount which we believe would be necessary to resolve our share of this matter if settlement discussions are not successful we intend to vigorously defend the pending claims while no assurance can be given as to the ultimate outcome management believes that the resolution of the blydenburgh matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition at june 30 2008 and our results of operations for the three fiscal years ended june 30 2008 are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements these judgments can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition concentration of credit risk inventory pension and other postretirement benefit costs goodwill and other intangible assets income taxes and derivatives 

  

management of the company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of the company’s board of directors 

  

revenue recognition 

revenues from merchandise sales are recognized upon transfer of ownership including passage of title to the customer and transfer of the risk of loss related to those goods in the americas region sales are generally recognized at the time the product is shipped to the customer and in the europe middle east  africa and asiapacific regions sales are generally recognized based upon the customer’s receipt in certain circumstances transfer of title takes place at the point of sale for example at our retail stores sales at our retail stores and online are recognized in accordance with a traditional 445 retail calendar where each fiscal quarter is comprised of two 4week periods and one 5week period with one extra week in one quarter every seven years as a result the retail quarterend and the fiscal quarterend may be different by up to six days 

  

revenues are reported on a net sales basis which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual product returns received discounts incentive arrangements with retailers and an amount established for anticipated product returns our practice is to accept product returns from retailers only if properly requested authorized and approved in accepting returns we typically provide a credit to the retailer against accounts receivable from that retailer as a percentage of gross sales returns were 44 42 and 50 in fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

  

our sales return accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net sales this accrual is calculated based on a history of actual returns estimated future returns and information provided by authorized retailers regarding their inventory levels consideration of these factors results in an accrual for anticipated sales returns that reflects increases or decreases related to seasonal fluctuations experience has shown a relationship between retailer inventory levels and sales returns in the subsequent period as well as a consistent pattern of returns due to the seasonal nature of our business in addition as necessary specific accruals may be established for significant future known or anticipated events the types of known or anticipated events that we have considered and will continue to consider include but are not limited to the financial condition of our customers store closings by retailers changes in the retail environment and our decision to continue or support new and existing products 

  

concentration of credit risk 

an entity is vulnerable to concentration of credit risk if it is exposed to risks of loss greater than it would have if it mitigated its risks through diversification of customers the significance of such credit risk depends on the extent and nature of the concentration 

  

during fiscal 2006 federated department stores inc acquired the may department stores company resulting in the merger of our previous two largest customers collectively “macy’s inc” this customer sells products primarily within north america and accounted for 9514 million or 12 9588 million or 14 and 10058 million or 16 of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively this customer accounted for 1092 million or 11 and 1053 million or 12 of our accounts receivable at june 30 2008 and 2007 respectively although management believes that this customer and our other major customers are sound and creditworthy a severe adverse impact on their business operations could have a corresponding material adverse effect on our net sales cash flows andor financial condition 

  

in the ordinary course of business we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions in the amount of 263 million and 233 million as of june 30 2008 and 2007 respectively our allowance for doubtful accounts is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net earnings the allowance for doubtful accounts was reduced by 102 million 182 million and 120 million for customer deductions and writeoffs in fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively and increased by 132 million 144 million and 102 million for additional provisions in fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively this reserve is based upon the evaluation of accounts receivable aging specific exposures and historical trends 

  

 20  

  

inventory 

we state our inventory at the lower of cost or fair market value with cost being determined on the firstin firstout fifo method we believe fifo most closely matches the flow of our products from manufacture through sale the reported net value of our inventory includes saleable products promotional products raw materials and componentry and work in process that will be sold or used in future periods inventory cost includes raw materials direct labor and overhead 

  

we also record an inventory obsolescence reserve which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated realizable value based on various product sales projections this reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales in addition and as necessary we may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events 

  

pension and other postretirement benefit costs 

we offer the following benefits to some or all of our employees a domestic trustbased noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan “us qualified plan” and an unfunded nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations collectively with the us qualified plan the “domestic plans” a domestic contributory defined contribution plan international pension plans which vary by country consisting of both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans deferred compensation arrangements and certain other postretirement benefit plans 

  

the amounts needed to fund future payouts under these plans are subject to numerous assumptions and variables certain significant variables require us to make assumptions that are within our control such as an anticipated discount rate expected rate of return on plan assets and future compensation levels we evaluate these assumptions with our actuarial advisors and we believe they are within accepted industry ranges although an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a direct impact on reported net earnings 

  

the preretirement discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated longterm bonds for fiscal 2008 we used a preretirement discount rate for our domestic plans of 625 and varying rates on our international plans of between 225 and 825 the preretirement rate for our domestic plans is based on a bond portfolio that includes only longterm bonds with an aa rating or equivalent from a major rating agency we believe the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio is expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of our domestic plans for fiscal 2008 we used an expected return on plan assets of 775 for our us qualified plan and varying rates of between 300 and 825 for our international plans in determining the longterm rate of return for a plan we consider the historical rates of return the nature of the plan’s investments and an expectation for the plan’s investment strategies the us qualified plan asset allocation as of june 30 2008 was approximately 40 equity investments 42 debt securities and 18 other investments the asset allocation of our combined international plans as of june 30 2008 was approximately 45 equity investments 38 debt securities and 17 other investments the difference between actual and expected return on plan assets is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income those gainslosses that are subject to amortization over future periods will be recognized as a component of the net periodic benefit cost in such future periods for fiscal 2008 our pension plans had actual negative return on assets of 193 million as compared with expected return on assets of 470 million which resulted in a net deferred loss of 663 million of which approximately 34 million is subject to amortization over periods ranging from approximately 8 to 16 years the actual negative return on assets was primarily related to the performance of equity markets during the past fiscal year 

  

a 25 basispoint change in the discount rate or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have had the following effect on fiscal 2008 pension expense 

  

   

our postretirement plans are comprised of health care plans that could be impacted by health care cost trend rates which may have a significant effect on the amounts reported a onepercentagepoint change in assumed health care cost trend rates for fiscal 2008 would have had the following effects 

  

   

 21  

  

for fiscal 2009 we are using a preretirement discount rate for the domestic plans of 675 and varying rates for our international plans of between 200 and 900 we are using an expected return on plan assets of 775 for the us qualified plan and varying rates for our international pension plans of between 325 and 900 the net change in these assumptions from those used in fiscal 2008 will result in a decrease in pension expense of approximately 36 million in fiscal 2009 we will continue to monitor the market conditions relative to these assumptions and adjust them accordingly 

  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets other intangible assets principally consist of purchased royalty rights and trademarks goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite life are not amortized 

  

on an annual basis or more frequently if certain events or circumstances warrant we test goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment to determine the fair value of these intangible assets there are many assumptions and estimates used that directly impact the results of the testing we have the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose to mitigate undue influence we use industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and in certain instances we engage thirdparty valuation specialists to advise us 

  

income taxes 

we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 109 “accounting for income taxes” as amended this statement establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effects of income taxes that result from an enterprise’s activities during the current and preceding years it requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes 

  

as of june 30 2008 we have current net deferred tax assets of 1846 million and noncurrent net deferred tax assets of 553 million the net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization as well as the continued application of currently anticipated tax rates included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance of 57 million for deferred tax assets where management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the relevant jurisdiction based on our assessments no additional valuation allowance is required if we determine that a deferred tax asset will not be realizable an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will result in a reduction of earnings at that time 

  

in june 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued fasb interpretation no “fin” 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” “fin 48” fin 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 109 fin 48 prescribes a twostep evaluation process for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the first step is recognition and the second is measurement fin 48 also provides guidance on derecognition measurement classification disclosures transition and accounting for interim periods in may 2007 the fasb issued fasb staff position “fsp” no fin 481 “definition of settlement in fasb interpretation no 48 an amendment of fasb interpretation fin no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” “fsp no fin 481” fsp no fin 481 provides guidance on how to determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits 

  

we adopted the provisions of fin 48 as amended effective july 1 2007 as a result we recognized an increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and interest of 131 million net of tax effect which as required was accounted for as a reduction to the july 1 2007 balance of retained earnings we elected to continue our historical practice of classifying applicable interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes 

  

we provide tax reserves for federal state local and international exposures relating to periods subject to audit the development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues potential outcomes and timing and is a subjective critical estimate we assess our tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting dates for those tax positions where it is morelikelythannot that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those tax positions where it is not morelikelythannot that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements where applicable associated interest and penalties have also been recognized although the outcome relating to these exposures is uncertain in management’s opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating from these exposures in certain circumstances the ultimate outcome of exposures and risks involves significant uncertainties which render them inestimable if actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates including those that cannot be quantified they could have a material impact on our results of operations as we experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 see “results of operations  fiscal 2007 as compared with fiscal 2006 – provision for income taxes ” 

  

 22  

  

derivatives 

we account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” as amended which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities this statement also requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and that they be measured at fair value 

  

we currently use derivative financial instruments to hedge certain anticipated transactions and interest rates as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies we do not utilize derivatives for trading or speculative purposes hedge effectiveness is documented assessed and monitored by employees who are qualified to make such assessments and monitor the instruments variables that are external to us such as social political and economic risks may have an impact on our hedging program and the results thereof for a discussion on the quantitative impact of market risks related to our derivative financial instruments refer to “ liquidity and capital resources – market risk” 

  

quantitative analysis 

during the threeyear period ended june 30 2008 there have not been material changes in the assumptions underlying these critical accounting policies nor to the related significant estimates with the exception of our tax settlement with the internal revenue service in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 which finalized the ultimate liability for exposures which were previously inestimable the results of our business underlying these assumptions have not differed significantly from our expectations 

  

while we believe that the estimates that we have made are proper and the related results of operations for the period are presented fairly in all material respects other assumptions could reasonably be justified that would change the amount of reported net sales cost of sales operating expenses or our provision for income taxes as they relate to the provisions for anticipated sales returns allowance for doubtful accounts inventory obsolescence reserve and income taxes for fiscal 2008 had these estimates been changed simultaneously by 25 in either direction our reported gross profit would have increased or decreased by approximately 52 million operating expenses would have changed by approximately 07 million and the provision for income taxes would have increased or decreased by approximately 17 million the collective impact of these changes on operating income net earnings and net earnings per diluted common share would be an increase or decrease of approximately 59 million 76 million and 04 respectively

overview 

  

we manufacture market and sell skin care makeup fragrance and hair care products which are distributed in over 140 countries and territories we believe that the best way to increase stockholder value is to provide our customers and consumers with the products and services that they have come to expect from us in the most efficient and profitable manner with this goal in mind we have developed a longterm strategy based on the following five imperatives 

  

1   optimize brand portfolio

2   strengthen product categories

3   strengthen and expand geographic presence

4   diversify and strengthen distribution channels

5   achieve operational and cost excellence

  

in fiscal 2008 we continued to find ways to strengthen our core brands and product categories maximize highgrowth brands and incubate and develop next generation brands net sales from estée lauder and clinique grew on a global basis fueled by strong demand outside of the united states where these brands generated approximately twothirds of their net sales we took measures to improve our business at the point of sale by investing in new modular display and tester units for the estée lauder brand at all north american department store locations and increased our focus to improve the service provided by estée lauder beauty advisors our clinique brand sponsored a program to improve the consumer experience at us and international department stores our faster growing m ž a ž c bobbi brown la mer and jo malone brands continued to increase their net sales in all of our geographic regions the recent launch of sean john unforgivable woman generated significant incremental net sales to our fragrance product category

  

in july 2007 we acquired ojon corporation a privately held hair care and skin care company based in canada that sells its products primarily through direct response television “drtv” and specialty stores we also recently announced that we purchased a minority interest in a privately held company that manufactures markets and sells beauty products in india under the forest essentials brand 

  

this past year we continued to build on our strength in research and development for example we further improved the estée lauder renutriv product line with the introduction of renutriv ultimate youth crème clinique launched a “dermatologistcertified” line called redness solutions to reduce the appearance of skin redness origins recently launched origins organics the first full line of skin body and hair care products to be certified under the usda national organic program

again in fiscal 2008 the majority of our net sales came from outside the united states we generated growth in sales and profits in our travel retail business including accelerated growth from downtown locations in asian cities border stores in latin america and shops on cruise ships we continued to increase our presence in china and russia and recently established affiliates in the middle east and india in an effort to improve the return on our media investment abroad we consolidated the work of several media agencies into one by selecting m2m a media company of omnicom media group to be our media agency in eight european and four asianpacific countries by doing so we anticipate integrating traditional media and expanding the use of internet and digital advertising in these areas 

  

in alternative distribution channels we continued to grow our online business in the united states where we sell products from 15 of our brands on companyowned websites with the recent expansion of our online business into korea we now sell products on our own ecommerce sites in five foreign countries in fiscal 2008 we also expanded our presence in the drtv distribution channel most significantly with the acquisition of ojon in july 2007 in the united states clinique debuted on qvc where bobbi brown origins and ojon currently have regular shows beautybank created eyes by design a brand which is currently being sold exclusively on hsn internationally ojon debuted on qvc in germany while bobbi brown and prescriptives aired on qvc in the united kingdom origins and good skin tm have also had shows on drtv in korea 

  

as part of our international pharmacy channel business initiative several distributor markets for darphin products will now be serviced by our own affiliates and origins opened more than 20 new pharmacies in france triaktiline by good skin tm launched in over 500 sephora doors throughout europe and exclusively in cosmed’s 250 pharmacies in taiwan our first entry in taiwan’s pharmacy channel in january 2008 we formed a strategic collaboration with allergan inc a global medical aesthetics company to develop a cliniquebranded skin care line clinique medical to be sold exclusively through physicians’ offices in the united states 

  

we continued to make progress on our strategic modernization initiative “smi” during fiscal 2008 demand planning for select business units began using sap software a critical part of smi we anticipate smi implementation will continue at additional primary locations in fiscal 2009 with the majority of our business to be implemented through fiscal 2012 

  

despite the rise in energy and raw material prices in the current year we were able to maintain our overall cost of sales margin through other efficiencies achieved from our ongoing savings initiatives we also opened a new distribution center in singapore to improve service levels in the fastgrowing asiapacific region in december 2007 we entered into agreements to ensure that the equivalent of all electricity utilized by our global operations division is generated from green sources we now rank 22nd on the epa’s list of leading fortune 500 companies in alternative power usage 

  

during fiscal 2008 we also faced challenges many of which we expect to be ongoing in fiscal 2009 we believe that economic uncertainty in the united states has affected our business particularly in the department store channel we continue to see softness in the united states including the impact of the consolidation and changes taking place among retailers in addition the fragrance category continues to be highly competitive these challenges have been mitigated through sales in alternative channels such as freestanding retail stores internet distribution selfselect distribution and drtv efforts to expand geographically are complicated by increasing regulatory issues and cultural barriers 

  

as we continue to implement our strategic imperatives we expect to make selective investments embark on new business endeavors and pursue initiatives that we believe will have longterm benefits the timing impact and magnitude of any particular actions such as an acquisition to strengthen our product categories andor diversify our distribution channels are subject to numerous factors and onetime charges that cannot be predicted

the following table presents certain consolidated earnings data as a percentage of net sales 

  

   

in order to meet the demands of consumers we continually introduce new products support new and established products through advertising sampling and merchandising and phase out existing products that no longer meet the needs of our consumers the economics of developing producing launching and supporting products influence our sales and operating performance each period the introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products which we take into account in our business planning 

  

the recent challenges and uncertainties in the economies of certain key countries including the united states may continue to have an adverse impact on consumer demand which could affect our net sales and operating results in the short and long term

hair care 

  

hair care net sales increased 13 or 500 million to 4271 million primarily due to the inclusion of the ojon brand which was acquired at the end of july 2007 as well as growth from aveda and bumble and bumble aveda net sales increases benefited from the recent launches of smooth infusion and aveda men pureformance products as well as the recent acquisition of an independent distributor bumble and bumble net sales benefited from new points of distribution and increases from its hotel amenities program which concluded in the third quarter excluding the impact of foreign currency translation hair care net sales increased 11

net sales in the americas increased 4 or 1506 million to 37115 million primarily reflecting net sales growth in canada and latin america as well as the addition of the ojon brand of approximately 98 million combined additional net sales increases of approximately 65 million were attributable to our designer fragrances business and our makeup artist and hair care brands in the united states partially offsetting this growth was approximately 37 million related to weaknesses in certain of our core brands in the united states as a result of competitive pressures and challenges in the department store channel we believe that economic uncertainty in the united states has affected our business particularly in the department store channel these challenges have been mitigated through sales in alternative channels such as freestanding retail stores internet distribution selfselect distribution and directresponse television excluding the impact of foreign currency translation net sales in the americas increased 3

  

all countries in europe the middle east  africa experienced net sales growth which contributed to the increase in net sales of 21 or 5133 million to 30067 million although net sales growth rates slowed in certain key countries this growth was led by our travel retail business and the united kingdom as well as in russia which benefited from our expansion in this emerging market the results in this region were inclusive of an exchange rate benefit due to the weakening of the us dollar of approximately 206 million excluding the impact of foreign currency translation net sales in europe the middle east  africa increased 12

cost of sales   

cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales was 252 which is the same as the prior year cost of sales as a percentage of net sales reflected a decrease in the level and timing of promotional activities of approximately 20 basis points and a positive effect of exchange rates of approximately 10 basis points offsetting these improvements was an unfavorable change in the mix of our business an increase in obsolescence charges and employeerelated charges designed to streamline certain business activities and achieve future cost savings of approximately 10 basis points each 

  

 27  

  

despite the rise in energy and raw material prices in the current year we were able to maintain our overall cost of goods margin through other efficiencies achieved from ongoing savings initiatives while sustained energy and raw material price increases could result in higher costs we believe that this will not have a material adverse effect on our cost of sales margin in the near future 

  

since certain promotional activities are a component of sales or cost of sales and the timing and level of promotions vary with our promotional calendar we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in the cost of sales percentage in addition future cost of sales mix may be impacted by the inclusion of new brands which have margin and product cost structures different from those of our existing brands 

  

operating expenses   operating expenses increased to 645 of net sales as compared with 641 of net sales in the prior year the increase in operating expenses and operating expense margin reflected higher costs of global information technology systems and infrastructure of approximately 30 basis points an additional 20 basis points resulted from an increase in valuation reserves reflecting the diminishing likelihood of realizing value from a promissory note and convertible preferred stock received in connection with the divestiture of stila in fiscal 2006 we also recorded an increase in intangible asset amortization resulting from recent strategic acquisitions as well as employeerelated charges designed to streamline certain business activities and achieve future cost savings of approximately 10 basis points each operating expense margin in the prior year was adversely impacted by charges related to our pharmacy channel of approximately 40 basis points

operating results   operating income increased 8 or 608 million to 8107 million as compared with the prior year operating margin declined to 103 of net sales as compared with 107 in the prior year reflecting our constant cost of sales margin and the increase in our operating expense margin as previously discussed

operating results 

  

due to the growth in net sales and the decreases in our cost of sales and operating expense margins as previously discussed operating income increased 21 or 1303 million to 7499 million as compared with fiscal 2006 operating margins were 107 of net sales as compared with 96 in fiscal 2006 which was negatively impacted by 14 of net sales as a result of the special charge related to our cost savings initiative 

  

the following discussions of operating results by product categories and geographic regions exclude the impact of special charges related to our cost savings initiative of 11 million and 921 million for the fiscal years ended june 30 2007 and 2006 respectively we believe the following analysis of operating results better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business see note 21 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

product categories 

  

fragrance operating results increased over 100 or 204 million to 281 million as profits from higher international net sales and lower spending at certain of our core brands in the united states more than offset spending behind new and developing brands hair care operating results grew 60 or 160 million to 425 million as the increase in net sales outpaced increased spending in support of new distribution points and product launches operating results increased 3 or 99 million to 3393 million in makeup primarily as a result of higher net sales and profits from our makeup artist brands which more than offset challenges among certain core brands skin care operating results decreased 1 or 49 million to 3415 million the results in this product category were negatively impacted in fiscal 2007 by charges related to our pharmacy channel we recorded approximately 30 million for organizational costs costs to streamline the distribution of goods and the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets in addition improvements in international skin care results were partially offset by challenges in certain core brands in the united states

in asiapacific operating income increased 33 or 231 million to 932 million this increase reflected improved results of approximately 23 million in hong kong china australia and korea 

  

interest expense net   net interest expense was 389 million as compared with 238 million in fiscal 2006 this change primarily resulted from higher average debt balances primarily associated with the funding of our accelerated share repurchase program and higher average interest rates also contributing to the increase was reduced interest income generated from lower average investment balances internationally partially offset by higher average investment rates these increases were partially offset by the capitalization of interest expense on internally developed software in connection with the upgrade of our information systems 

  

provision for income taxes   the provision for income taxes represents federal foreign state and local income taxes the effective rate differs from statutory rates due to the effect of state and local taxes tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and certain nondeductible expenses our effective tax rate will change from year to year based on nonrecurring and recurring factors including but not limited to the geographical mix of earnings enacted tax legislation state and local taxes tax audit settlements and the interaction of various global tax strategies the effective rate for income taxes for the year ended june 30 2007 was 359 as compared with 436 in fiscal 2006 the decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily attributable to the fiscal 2006 effect of the irs tax settlement of approximately 770 basis points

we have a fixed rate promissory note agreement with a financial institution pursuant to which we may borrow up to 1500 million in the form of loan participation notes through one of our subsidiaries in europe the interest rate on borrowings under this agreement is at an allin fixed rate determined by the lender and agreed to by us at the date of each borrowing at june 30 2008 no borrowings were outstanding under this agreement debt issuance costs incurred related to this agreement were de minimis 

  

we have an overdraft borrowing agreement with a financial institution pursuant to which our subsidiary in turkey may be credited to satisfy outstanding negative daily balances arising from its business operations the total balance outstanding at any time shall not exceed 200 million turkish lira the interest rate applicable to each such credit shall be 40 basis points per annum above the spot rate charged by the lender or the lender’s floating call rate agreed to by us at each borrowing there were no debt issuance costs incurred related to this agreement the outstanding balance at june 30 2008 131 million at the exchange rate at june 30 2008 is classified as shortterm debt in our consolidated balance sheet subsequent to june 30 2008 this facility was increased to 300 million turkish lira and the interest rate spread on borrowings was increased to 55 basis points per annum 

  

we have a 30 billion yen revolving credit facility that expires on march 24 2009 the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on tibor tokyo interbank offered rate and a 10 basis point facility fee is incurred on the undrawn balance at june 30 2008 no borrowings were outstanding under this facility 

  

our business is seasonal in nature and accordingly our working capital needs vary from time to time we may enter into investing and financing transactions that require additional funding to the extent that these needs exceed cash from operations we could subject to market conditions issue commercial paper issue longterm debt securities or borrow under our revolving credit facilities 

  

total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 42 at june 30 2008 and 48 at june 30 2007 

  

the effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years generally we have been able to introduce new products at higher selling prices or increase selling prices sufficiently to offset cost increases which have been moderate 

  

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that cash on hand cash generated from operations available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business operations information systems enhancements capital expenditures stock repurchases commitments and other contractual obligations on both a nearterm and longterm basis 

  

cash flows 

net cash provided by operating activities was 6901 million 6616 million and 7098 million in fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the increase in fiscal 2008 as compared with fiscal 2007 primarily reflected a higher level of cash generated from net earnings before noncash items such as depreciation amortization and stockbased compensation approximately 91 million of the change in deferred income taxes was offset by a correlative change in noncurrent accrued income taxes reflecting the balance sheet presentation of unrecognized tax benefits see note 9 of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion these changes were partially offset by the timing and level of payments on trade payables in north america and higher accounts receivable levels primarily reflecting the continuing significant sales growth from our international operations which carry longer customer payment terms 

  

the net decrease in operating cash flows from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 reflected higher domestic and international inventory levels primarily driven by growth in new and emerging international markets increased regulatory requirements and the building of safety stock for the implementation of sap as part of our strategic modernization initiative at our aveda manufacturing facility in addition the decrease in operating cash flows reflected higher accounts receivable balances primarily related to significant sales growth from our international operations cash flows were also impacted by cash payments made during fiscal 2007 related to our fiscal 2006 cost savings initiative partially offsetting the decrease was an improvement in cash generated from net earnings from continuing operations 

  

 33  

  

net cash used for investing activities was 4785 million 3738 million and 3032 million in fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 the increase during fiscal 2008 primarily reflected cash payments related to the acquisition of ojon corporation and the exclusive rights to sell and distribute ojon products worldwide and to a lesser extent the acquisition of an aveda distributor capital expenditures also increased from the prior year reflecting incremental spending for counters and the higher costs of technology related to our continuing companywide initiative to upgrade our information systems the increase in cash flows used for investing activities from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 primarily reflected capital expenditures which reflected our companywide initiative to upgrade our information systems as well as store improvements and counter construction fiscal 2007 investing activities also reflected the purchase of the remaining equity interest in bumble and bumble products llc and bumble and bumble llc as well as the acquisition of businesses engaged in the wholesale distribution and retail sale of our products in the united states and other countries 

  

cash used for financing activities was 781 million 4116 million and 5946 million in fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the fiscal 2008 improvement in cash used for financing activities primarily reflected higher treasury stock repurchases in the prior year which were partially funded by the issuance of longterm debt also contributing to the change in net cash used for financing activities was an increase in outstanding commercial paper partially offset by lower cash inflows from stock option exercises the improvement in cash flows used for financing activities from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 reflected a net increase in shortterm and longterm borrowings and an increase in proceeds from employee stock transactions partially offset by increases in treasury stock repurchases and an increase in dividends paid to stockholders 

  

dividends 

on november 9 2007 the board of directors declared an annual dividend of 55 per share on our class a and class b common stock of which an aggregate of 1066 million was paid on december 27 2007 to stockholders of record at the close of business on december 7 2007 the annual common stock dividend declared during fiscal 2007 was 50 per share of which an aggregate of 1036 million was paid on december 27 2006 to stockholders of record at the close of business on december 8 2006 

  

pension plan funding and expense 

we maintain pension plans covering substantially all of our fulltime employees for our us operations and a majority of our international operations several plans provide pension benefits based primarily on years of service and employees’ earnings in the united states we maintain a trustbased noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan “us qualified plan” additionally we have an unfunded nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations our international pension plans are comprised of defined benefit and defined contribution plans 

  

several factors influence our annual funding requirements for the us qualified plan our funding policy consists of annual contributions at a rate that provides for future plan benefits and maintains appropriate funded percentages such contribution is not less than the minimum required by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended “erisa” and subsequent pension legislation and is not more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes for each international plan our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations in addition amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions as detailed in “ critical accounting polices and estimates ” the effect of our pension plan funding on future operating results will depend on economic conditions employee demographics mortality rates the number of participants electing to take lumpsum distributions investment performance and funding decisions 

  

for fiscal 2008 and 2007 there was no minimum contribution to the us qualified plan required by erisa during the first quarter of fiscal 2007 the pension protection act of 2006 was adopted into law in the united states certain provisions of this law changed the calculation related to the maximum contribution amount deductible for income tax purposes as a result of these provisions we made discretionary contributions totaling 250 million and 200 million to the us qualified plan during fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively during fiscal 2009 we expect to make cash contributions totaling approximately 15 million to the us qualified plan

  

for fiscal 2008 and 2007 we made benefit payments under our nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan of 77 million and 53 million respectively we expect to make benefit payments under this plan during fiscal 2009 of approximately 7 million for fiscal 2008 and 2007 we made cash contributions to our international defined benefit pension plans of 353 million and 240 million respectively we expect to make contributions under these plans during fiscal 2009 of approximately 46 million 

  

commitments and contingencies 

certain of our business acquisition agreements include “earnout” provisions these provisions generally require that we pay to the seller or sellers of the business additional amounts based on the performance of the acquired business   since the size of each payment depends upon performance of the acquired business we do not expect that such payments will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or financial condition 

  

for additional contingencies refer to “item 3 legal proceedings”

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes scheduled maturities of our contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed and determinable as of june 30 2008 

  

   

1   includes longterm and shortterm debt and the related projected interest costs and to a lesser extent capital lease commitments interest costs on longterm and shortterm debt are projected to be 576 million in fiscal 2009 588 million in fiscal 2010 574 million in each of the years from fiscal 2011 through fiscal 2012 425 million in fiscal 2013 and 7138 million thereafter projected interest costs on variable rate instruments were calculated using market rates at june 30 2008 refer to note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements

2   unconditional purchase obligations primarily include inventory commitments estimated future earnout payments estimated royalty payments pursuant to license agreements advertising commitments capital improvement commitments planned funding of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations commitments pursuant to executive compensation arrangements and obligations related to our cost savings initiative future earnout payments and future royalty and advertising commitments were estimated based on planned future sales for the term that was in effect at june 30 2008 without consideration for potential renewal periods

3   refer to note 9 of notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding unrecognized tax benefits during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we made a cash payment of 350 million to the us treasury as an advance deposit which is not reflected as a reduction to the 757 million as of june 30 2008 the noncurrent portion of our unrecognized tax benefits including related accrued interest and penalties was 1773 million at this time the settlement period for the noncurrent portion of the unrecognized tax benefits including related accrued interest and penalties cannot be determined and therefore was not included

  

derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 

we address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments we primarily enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates we also enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the effects of fluctuating interest rates we categorize these instruments as entered into for purposes other than trading 

  

for each derivative contract entered into where we look to obtain special hedge accounting treatment we formally document the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item as well as its riskmanagement objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge the nature of the risk being hedged how the hedging instruments’ effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively and a description of the method of measuring ineffectiveness this process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as fairvalue cashflow or foreigncurrency hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions we also formally assess both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items if it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective then we will be required to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively 

  

 35  

  

foreign exchange risk management 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge anticipated transactions as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies for periods consistent with our identified exposures the purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on our costs and on the cash flows that we receive from foreign subsidiaries the majority of foreign currency forward contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries and are with large financial institutions rated as strong investment grade by a major rating agency we also enter into foreign currency option contracts to hedge anticipated transactions where there is a high probability that anticipated exposures will materialize the foreign currency forward and option contracts entered into to hedge anticipated transactions have been designated as cashflow hedges hedge effectiveness of foreign currency forward contracts is based on a hypothetical derivative methodology and excludes the portion of fair value attributable to the spotforward difference which is recorded in currentperiod earnings hedge effectiveness of foreign currency option contracts is based on a dollar offset methodology the ineffective portion of both foreign currency forward and option contracts is recorded in currentperiod earnings for hedge contracts that are no longer deemed highly effective hedge accounting is discontinued and gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are reclassified to earnings when the underlying forecasted transaction occurs if it is probable that the forecasted transaction will no longer occur then any gains or losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are reclassified to currentperiod earnings as of june 30 2008 these cashflow hedges were highly effective in all material respects 

  

as a matter of policy we only enter into contracts with counterparties that have at least an “a” or equivalent credit rating the counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions we do not have significant exposure to any one counterparty our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to only the recognized but not realized gains attributable to the contracts management believes risk of default under these hedging contracts is remote and in any event would not be material to the consolidated financial results the contracts have varying maturities through the end of june 2009 costs associated with entering into such contracts have not been material to our consolidated financial results we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

  

at june 30 2008 we had foreign currency forward contracts and option contracts in the amount of 12290 million and 649 million respectively the foreign currencies included in foreign currency forward contracts notional value stated in us dollars are principally the euro 2216 million british pound 2207 million swiss franc 2065 million canadian dollar 1300 million australian dollar 918 million russian ruble 719 million and japanese yen 644 million the foreign currencies included in foreign currency option contracts notional value stated in us dollars are principally the canadian dollar 368 million and the south korean won 231 million 

  

interest rate risk management 

we enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the exposure to fluctuations of interest rates on our funded indebtedness and anticipated issuance of debt for periods consistent with the identified exposures all interest rate derivative contracts are with large financial institutions rated as strong investment grade by a major rating agency 

  

we have interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount totaling 2500 million to effectively convert the fixed rate interest on our 2017 senior notes to variable interest rates based on sixmonth libor the interest rate swaps were designated as fairvalue hedges as of june 30 2008 these fairvalue hedges were highly effective in all material respects 

  

market risk 

we use a valueatrisk model to assess the market risk of our derivative financial instruments valueatrisk represents the potential losses for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors for a specified time period and confidence level we estimate valueatrisk across all of our derivative financial instruments using a model with historical volatilities and correlations calculated over the past 250day period the measured valueatrisk calculated as an average for the twelve months ended june 30 2008 related to our foreign exchange contracts and our interest rate contracts was 113 million and 200 million respectively   the model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 percent confidence level we used a statistical simulation model that valued our derivative financial instruments against one thousand randomly generated market price paths 

  

our calculated valueatrisk exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may or may not occur it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated based upon actual fluctuations in market rates operating exposures and the timing thereof and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year 

  

we believe however that any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the derivative financial instrument was intended 

  

 36  

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

we do not maintain any offbalance sheet arrangements transactions obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations 

  

recently issued accounting standards 

  

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas no 157” to clarify the definition of fair value establish a framework for measuring fair value and expand the disclosures on fair value measurements sfas no 157 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date an exit price sfas no 157 also stipulates that as a marketbased measurement fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between a market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs and b the reporting entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances unobservable inputs 

  

in february 2008 the fasb issued fsp no fas 1571 “application of fasb statement no 157 to fasb statement no 13 and other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements for purposes of lease classification or measurement under statement 13” this fsp amends sfas no 157 to exclude certain leasing transactions accounted for under previously existing accounting guidance however this scope exception does not apply to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination regardless of whether those assets and liabilities are related to leases 

  

sfas no 157 becomes effective for us in the beginning of fiscal 2009 we are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of sfas no 157 on our consolidated financial statements in february 2008 the fasb issued fsp no fas 1572 “effective date for fasb statement no 157” this fsp permits the delayed application of sfas no 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities as defined in this fsp except for those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements at least annually until the beginning of our fiscal 2010

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141 revised 2007 “business combinations” “sfas no 141r” sfas no 141r replaces sfas no 141 “business combinations” however it retains the fundamental requirements of the former statement that the acquisition method of accounting previously referred to as the purchase method be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination sfas no 141r defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses in the business combination and establishes the acquisition date as the date that the acquirer achieves control among other requirements sfas no 141r requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the identifiable assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their acquisitiondate fair values with limited exceptions acquisitionrelated costs generally will be expensed as incurred sfas no 141r requires certain financial statement disclosures to enable users to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effects of the business combination sfas no 141r must be applied prospectively to business combinations that are consummated on or after july 1 2009 

  

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 51” “sfas no 160” to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary among other requirements sfas no 160 clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary which is sometimes referred to as minority interest is to be reported as a separate component of equity in the consolidated financial statements sfas no 160 also requires consolidated net income to include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest and to disclose those amounts on the face of the consolidated statement of income sfas no 160 must be applied prospectively for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning in our fiscal 2010 except for the presentation and disclosure requirements which will be applied retrospectively for all periods presented 

  

 37  

  

in december 2007 the fasb ratified the consensus reached on emerging issues task force “eitf” issue no 071 “collaborative arrangements” “eitf no 071” this eitf addresses accounting for collaborative arrangement activities that are conducted without the creation of a separate legal entity for the arrangement revenues and costs incurred with third parties in connection with the collaborative arrangement should be presented gross or net by the collaborators pursuant to the guidance in eitf 9919 “reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent” and other applicable accounting literature payments to or from collaborators should be presented in the income statement based on the nature of the arrangement the nature of the company’s business and whether the payments are within the scope of other accounting literature other detailed information related to the collaborative arrangement is also required to be disclosed the requirements under this eitf must be applied to collaborative arrangements in existence at the beginning of our fiscal 2010 using a modified version of retrospective application we are currently evaluating the impact the provisions of eitf no 071 will have on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in march 2008 the fasb issued sfas no 161 “disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities – an amendment of fasb statement no 133” “sfas no 161” sfas no 161 requires companies to provide qualitative disclosures about their objectives and strategies for using derivative instruments quantitative disclosures of the fair values and gains and losses of these derivative instruments in a tabular format as well as more information about liquidity by requiring disclosure of a derivative contract’s creditriskrelated contingent features sfas no 161 also requires crossreferencing within footnotes to enable financial statement users to locate important information about derivative instruments we are currently evaluating the disclosure requirements of sfas no 161 as this is a disclosureonly standard we do not anticipate an impact on our consolidated financial statements as a result of its adoption sfas no 161 becomes effective for our march 2009 interim consolidated financial statements 

  

in april 2008 the fasb issued fsp no fas 1423 “determination of the useful life of intangible assets” this fsp amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas no 142” this fsp also adds certain disclosures to those already prescribed in sfas no 142 fsp no fas 1423 becomes effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning in our fiscal 2010 the guidance for determining useful lives must be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date the disclosure requirements must be applied prospectively to all intangible assets recognized as of the effective date 

  

in june 2008 the fasb issued fsp no eitf 0361 “determining whether instruments granted in sharebased payment transactions are participating securities” this fsp provides that unvested sharebased payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the twoclass method this fsp is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 and interim periods within those years upon adoption a company is required to retrospectively adjust its earnings per share data including any amounts related to interim periods summaries of earnings and selected financial data to conform with the provisions in this fsp early application of this fsp is prohibited we do not issue sharebased payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents

information systems 

information systems support business processes including product development marketing sales order processing production distribution and finance of the many systems currently being utilized the most significant to our business needs are i a centralized data repository of essential attributes for each of the products we offer or plan to offer which enables us to globally manufacture and market products of consistent quality ii a sales analysis system to track weekly sales at the stock keeping unit sku level at most significant retail sales locations ie sellthrough data increasing our understanding of consumer preferences and enabling us to coordinate more effectively our product development manufacturing and marketing strategies iii an automated replenishment system with many of our key domestic customers allowing us to replenish inventories for individual points of sale automatically with minimal paperwork and iv an inventory management system to provide us with a global view of finished goods availability relative to actual requirements facilitating inventory control and distribution for both existing product lines and new product launches 

we expect that these systems will continue to provide pertinent inventory and sales data in the short term however as part of our longterm effort to enhance these systems and increase productivity we are implementing our strategic modernization initiative “smi” which includes an enterprisewide global program that we expect will deliver a single set of integrated data processes and technologies which would be scalable and used to standardize business processes across brands operating units and sales affiliates the initial implementation of smi at our aveda operating unit occurred in may 2007 and we believe it is operating effectively we anticipate smi implementation will continue at additional locations in fiscal 2008 with the majority of our locations to be implemented through fiscal 2010

 item 1a risk factors 

there are risks associated with an investment in our securities 

please consider the following risks and all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k and in our subsequent filings with the securities and exchange commission “sec” our business may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial if any of the events contemplated by the following discussion of risks should occur or other risks arise or develop our business prospects financial condition and results of operations as well as the trading prices of our securities may be adversely affected 

the beauty business is highly competitive and if we are unable to compete effectively our results will suffer 

we face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world including multinational consumer product companies some of these competitors have greater resources than we do and may be able to respond to changing business and economic conditions more quickly than us competition in the beauty business is based on pricing of products innovation perceived value service to the consumer promotional activities advertising special events new product introductions electronic commerce initiatives and other activities it is difficult for us to predict the timing and scale of our competitors’ actions in these areas in particular the fragrance category in the united states is influenced by the high volume of new product introductions by diverse companies across several different distribution channels also the trend toward consolidation in the retail trade particularly in developed markets such as the united states and western europe has resulted in us becoming increasingly dependent on key retailers including largeformat retailers who have increased their bargaining strength this trend has also resulted in an increased risk related to the concentration of our customers a severe adverse impact on their business operations could have a corresponding material adverse effect on us our ability to compete also depends on the continued strength of our brands our ability to attract and retain key talent and other personnel the efficiency of our manufacturing facilities and distribution network and our ability to protect our intellectual property our inability to continue to compete effectively in countries around the world could have an adverse impact on our business 

our inability to anticipate and respond to market trends and changes in consumer preferences could adversely affect our financial results 

our continued success depends on our ability to anticipate gauge and react in a timely and costeffective manner to changes in consumer tastes for skin care makeup fragrance and hair care products as well as to where and how consumers shop for those products we must continually work to develop produce and market new products maintain and enhance the recognition of our brands achieve a favorable mix of products and refine our approach as to how and where we market and sell our products while we devote considerable effort and resources to shape analyze and respond to consumer preferences we recognize that consumer tastes cannot be predicted with certainty and can change rapidly if we are unable to anticipate and respond to trends in the market for our products and changing consumer demands our financial results will suffer 

our future success depends on our ability to achieve our longterm strategy 

our longterm strategy is based on five strategic imperatives 

1   optimize brand portfolio

2   strengthen product categories

3   strengthen and expand geographic presence

4   diversify and strengthen distribution channels

5   achieve operational and cost excellence

achieving our longterm objectives may require investment in new brands categories distribution channels technologies and geographic markets these investments may result in shortterm costs without any current revenues and therefore may be dilutive to our earnings at least in the shortterm in addition we may dispose of our brands and incur costs in doing so although we believe that our strategic imperatives will lead to longterm growth in revenue and profitability we may not realize in full or in part the anticipated benefits the failure to realize benefits which may be due to our ability to execute plans or other risks described herein could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

any future acquisitions may expose us to additional risks 

we continuously review acquisition opportunities that would expand our current product offerings our distribution channels increase the size and geographic scope of our operations or otherwise offer growth and operating efficiency opportunities if required the financing for any of these acquisitions could result in an increase in our indebtedness dilute the interests of our stockholders or both acquisitions may entail numerous risks including 

·   difficulties in assimilating acquired operations or products including the loss of key employees from or customers of acquired businesses

·   diversion of management’s attention from our core businesses

·   adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and

·   risks of entering distribution channels categories or markets in which we have limited or no prior experience

our failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate acquisitions on favorable terms 

a general economic downturn or sudden disruption in business conditions may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items which could adversely affect our financial results 

the general level of consumer spending is affected by a number of factors including general economic conditions inflation interest rates energy costs and consumer confidence generally all of which are beyond our control consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower and may impact sales of our products in addition sudden disruptions in business conditions for example as a consequence of events such as the outbreak of sars in 2003 or those that are currently taking place in the middle east or as a result of a terrorist attack retaliation and the threat of further attacks or retaliation or as a result of adverse weather conditions such as hurricane katrina can have a short and sometimes longterm impact on consumer spending 

events that impact consumers’ willingness or ability to travel andor purchase our products while traveling may impact our travel retail business which is a significant contributor to our overall results 

a downturn in the economies in which we sell our products or a sudden disruption of business conditions in those economies could adversely affect our sales 

changes in laws regulations and policies that affect our business could adversely affect our financial results 

our business is subject to numerous laws regulations and policies changes in the laws regulations and policies including the interpretation or enforcement thereof that affect or will affect our business including changes in accounting standards tax laws and regulations trade rules and customs regulations and the outcome and expense of legal or regulatory proceedings and any action we may take as a result could adversely affect our financial results 

our success depends in part on the quality and safety of our products 

our success depends in part on the quality and safety of our products if our products are found to be defective or unsafe or if they otherwise fail to meet our consumers’ standards our relationships with customers or consumers could suffer the appeal of one or more of our brands could be diminished and we could lose sales andor become subject to liability claims any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our success depends in part on our key personnel 

our success depends in part on our ability to retain our key personnel including our executive officers and senior management team the unexpected loss of one or more of our key employees could adversely affect our business our success also depends in part on our continuing ability to identify hire train and retain other highly qualified personnel competition for these employees can be intense we may not be able to attract assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business this risk may be exacerbated by the stresses associated with the implementation of smi as defined below and other initiatives 

we are subject to risks related to our international operations 

we operate on a global basis with approximately 54 of our fiscal 2007 net sales generated outside the united states we maintain offices in over 35 countries and have key operational facilities located outside the united states that manufacture warehouse or distribute goods for sale throughout the world foreign operations are subject to many risks and uncertainties including 

·   fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which can affect our results of operations the value of our foreign assets the relative prices at which we and foreign competitors sell products in the same markets and the cost of certain inventory and noninventory items required in our operations

·   changes in foreign laws regulations and policies including restrictions on trade import and export license requirements and tariffs and taxes as well as changes in united states laws and regulations relating to foreign trade and investment and

·   adverse weather conditions social economic and geopolitical conditions such as terrorist attacks war or other military action

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects results of operations and financial condition 

a disruption in operations could adversely affect our business and financial results 

as a company engaged in manufacturing and distribution on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including industrial accidents environmental events strikes and other labor disputes disruptions in logistics or information systems loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites product quality control safety licensing requirements and other regulatory issues as well as natural disasters and other external factors over which we have no control if such an event were to occur it could have an adverse affect on our business and financial results 

our information systems and websites may be susceptible to outages and other risks 

we have information systems that support our business processes including product development marketing sales order processing production distribution finance and intracompany communications throughout the world we have ecommerce and other internet websites in the united states and many other countries these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire floods power loss telecommunications failures breakins and similar events despite the implementation of network security measures our systems may be vulnerable to computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering the occurrence of these or other events could disrupt or damage our information systems and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we are subject to risks associated with implementing global information systems 

as part of a program that we call our “strategic modernization initiative” or “smi” we are implementing enterprisewide global programs intended to deliver a single set of integrated data processes and technologies which would be scalable and used to standardize business processes across brands operating units and sales affiliates we implemented smi at our aveda operating unit in may 2007 we anticipate smi implementation will continue at additional locations in fiscal 2008 with the majority of our locations to be implemented through fiscal 2010 like most entitywide changes to software systems the implementation of smi involves risks and uncertainties failure to implement smi as planned in terms of timing specifications andor costs could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

the trading prices of our securities periodically may rise or fall based on the accuracy of predictions of our earnings or other financial performance 

our business planning process is designed to maximize our longterm strength growth and profitability not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter we believe that this longerterm focus is in the best interests of the company and our stockholders at the same time however we recognize that it may be helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our forecast of net sales and earnings accordingly when we announced our yearend financial results for fiscal 2007 we provided guidance as to our expected net sales and earnings for the fiscal year ending june 30 2008 and the quarter ending september 30 2007 while we generally expect to provide updates to our guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter we assume no responsibility to update any of our forwardlooking statements at such times or otherwise in addition the longerterm guidance we provide is based on goals that we believe at the time guidance is given are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years such targets are more speculative than our current quarter and fiscal year expectations 

in all of our public statements when we make or update a forwardlooking statement about our sales andor earnings expectations we accompany such statements directly or by reference to a public document with a list of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we expect such a list is included among other places in our earnings press release and in our periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission eg in our reports on form 10k and form 10q these and other factors may make it difficult for outside observers such as research analysts to predict what our earnings will be in any given fiscal quarter or year 

outside analysts like all investors have the right to make their own predictions of our financial results for any future period outside analysts however have access to no more material information about our plans than any other public investor and we do not endorse their predictions as to our future performance nor do we assume any responsibility to correct the predictions of outside analysts or others when they differ from our own internal expectations if and when we announce actual results that differ from those that outside analysts or others have been predicting the market price of our securities could be affected investors who rely on the predictions of outside analysts or others when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk we take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in the prices of our securities

 item 3 legal proceedings  

we are involved from time to time in litigation and other legal proceedings incidental to our business management believes that the outcome of current litigation and legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial condition however management’s assessment of our current litigation and other legal proceedings could change in light of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions or other proceedings pending against us not presently known to us or determinations by judges juries or other finders of fact which are not in accord with management’s evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such litigation or proceedings

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition at june 30 2007 and our results of operations for the three fiscal years ended june 30 2007 are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements these judgments can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition concentration of credit risk inventory pension and other postretirement benefit costs goodwill and other intangible assets income taxes derivatives and stockbased compensation 

management of the company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of the company’s board of directors 

revenue recognition 

revenues from merchandise sales are recognized upon transfer of ownership including passage of title to the customer and transfer of the risk of loss related to those goods in the americas region sales are generally recognized at the time the product is shipped to the customer and in the europe middle east  africa and asiapacific regions sales are generally recognized based upon the customer’s receipt in certain circumstances transfer of title takes place at the point of sale for example at our retail stores sales at our retail stores and online are recognized in accordance with a 445 retail calendar 

revenues are reported on a net sales basis which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual product returns received discounts incentive arrangements with retailers and an amount established for anticipated product returns our practice is to accept product returns from retailers only if properly requested authorized and approved in accepting returns we typically provide a credit to the retailer against accounts receivable from that retailer as a percentage of gross sales returns were 42 50 and 46 in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

our sales return accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net sales this accrual is calculated based on a history of actual returns estimated future returns and information provided by authorized retailers regarding their inventory levels consideration of these factors results in an accrual for anticipated sales returns that reflects increases or decreases related to seasonal fluctuations experience has shown a relationship between retailer inventory levels and sales returns in the subsequent period as well as a consistent pattern of returns due to the seasonal nature of our business in addition as necessary specific accruals may be established for significant future known or anticipated events the types of known or anticipated events that we have considered and will continue to consider include but are not limited to the financial condition of our customers store closings by retailers changes in the retail environment and our decision to continue or support new and existing products 

concentration of credit risk 

an entity is vulnerable to concentration of credit risk if it is exposed to risks of loss greater than it would have if it mitigated its risks through diversification of customers the significance of such credit risk depends on the extent and nature of the concentration 

during fiscal 2006 federated department stores inc acquired the may department stores company resulting in the merger of our previous two largest customers collectively “macy’s inc” this customer sells products primarily within north america and accounted for 9588 million or 14 and 10058 million or 16 of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2007 and 2006 respectively this customer accounted for 1053 million or 12 and 1054 million or 14 of our accounts receivable at june 30 2007 and 2006 respectively although management believes that this customer and our other major customers are sound and creditworthy a severe adverse impact on their business operations could have a corresponding material adverse effect on our net sales cash flows andor financial condition 

in the ordinary course of business we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions in the amount of 233 million and 271 million as of june 30 2007 and 2006 respectively our allowance for doubtful accounts is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net earnings the allowance for doubtful accounts was reduced by 182 million 120 million and 126 million for customer deductions and writeoffs in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively and increased by 144 million 102 million and 114 million for additional provisions in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively this reserve is based upon the evaluation of accounts receivable aging specific exposures and historical trends 

inventory 

we state our inventory at the lower of cost or fair market value with cost being determined on the firstin firstout fifo method we believe fifo most closely matches the flow of our products from manufacture through sale the reported net value of our inventory includes saleable products promotional products raw materials and componentry and work in process that will be sold or used in future periods inventory cost includes raw materials direct labor and overhead 

we also record an inventory obsolescence reserve which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated realizable value based on various product sales projections this reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales in addition and as necessary we may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events 

pension and other postretirement benefit costs 

we offer the following benefits to some or all of our employees a domestic trustbased noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan “us qualified plan” and an unfunded nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations collectively with the us qualified plan the “domestic plans” a domestic contributory defined contribution plan international pension plans which vary by country consisting of both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans deferred compensation arrangements and certain other postretirement benefit plans 

the amounts needed to fund future payouts under these plans are subject to numerous assumptions and variables certain significant variables require us to make assumptions that are within our control such as an anticipated discount rate expected rate of return on plan assets and future compensation levels we evaluate these assumptions with our actuarial advisors and we believe they are within accepted industry ranges although an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a direct impact on reported net earnings 

the preretirement discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated longterm bonds for fiscal 2007 we used a preretirement discount rate for our domestic plans of 625 and varying rates on our international plans of between 225 and 625 the preretirement rate for our domestic plans is based on a bond portfolio that includes only longterm bonds with an aa rating or equivalent from a major rating agency we believe the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio is expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of our domestic plans for fiscal 2007 we used an expected return on plan assets of 775 for our us qualified plan and varying rates of between 275 and 725 for our international plans in determining the longterm rate of return for a plan we consider the historical rates of return the nature of the plan’s investments and an expectation for the plan’s investment strategies the us qualified plan asset allocation as of june 30 2007 was approximately 49 equity investments 31 fixed income investments and 20 other investments the asset allocation of our combined international plans as of june 30 2007 was approximately 55 equity investments 29 fixed income investments and 16 other investments the difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets is accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore affects our recorded obligations and recognized expenses in such future periods for fiscal 2007 our pension plans had actual returns on assets of 801 million as compared with expected returns on assets of 425 million which resulted in a net deferred gain of 376 million 

a 25 basispoint change in the discount rate or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have had the following effect on fiscal 2007 pension expense 

   

our postretirement plans are comprised of health care plans that could be impacted by health care cost trend rates which may have a significant effect on the amounts reported a onepercentagepoint change in assumed health care cost trend rates for fiscal 2007 would have had the following effects 

   

for fiscal 2008 we are using a preretirement discount rate for the domestic plans of 625 and varying rates for our international plans of between 225 and 625 we are using an expected return on plan assets of 775 for the us qualified plan and varying rates for our international pension plans of between 300 and 675 the net change in these assumptions from those used in fiscal 2007 will result in a decrease in pension expense of approximately 20 million in fiscal 2008 we will continue to monitor the market conditions relative to these assumptions and adjust them accordingly 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets other intangible assets principally consist of purchased royalty rights and trademarks goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite life are not amortized 

on an annual basis or more frequently if certain events or circumstances warrant we test goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment to determine the fair value of these intangible assets there are many assumptions and estimates used that directly impact the results of the testing we have the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose to mitigate undue influence we use industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and in certain instances we engage thirdparty valuation specialists to advise us 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 109 “accounting for income taxes” as amended this statement establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effects of income taxes that result from an enterprise’s activities during the current and preceding years it requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes 

as of june 30 2007 we have current net deferred tax assets of 1240 million and noncurrent net deferred tax liabilities of 166 million the net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization as well as the continued application of currently anticipated tax rates included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance of approximately 55 million for deferred tax assets where management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the relevant jurisdiction based on our assessments no additional valuation allowance is required if we determine that a deferred tax asset will not be realizable an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will result in a reduction of earnings at that time 

we provide tax reserves for federal state local and international exposures relating to periods subject to audit the development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues potential outcomes and timing and is a subjective critical estimate although the outcome relating to these exposures is uncertain in management’s opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating from these exposures in certain circumstances the ultimate outcome of exposures and risks involves significant uncertainties which render them inestimable if actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates including those that cannot be quantified they could have a material impact on our results of operations as we experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 see “results of operations  fiscal 2006 as compared with fiscal 2005 – provision for income taxes ” 

derivatives 

we account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” as amended which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities this statement also requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and that they be measured at fair value 

we currently use derivative financial instruments to hedge certain anticipated transactions and interest rates as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies we do not utilize derivatives for trading or speculative purposes hedge effectiveness is documented assessed and monitored by employees who are qualified to make such assessments and monitor the instruments variables that are external to us such as social political and economic risks may have an impact on our hedging program and the results thereof for a discussion on the quantitative impact of market risks related to our derivative financial instruments refer to “ liquidity and capital resources – market risk” 

stockbased compensation 

we are required to record the fair value of stockbased compensation awards as an expense in accordance with sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” as amended in order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant we apply the blackscholes optionpricing model inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stockprice volatility option life riskfree interest rate and dividend yield while the riskfree interest rate and dividend yield are less subjective assumptions that are based on factual data derived from public sources the expected stockprice volatility and option life assumptions require a greater level of judgment which makes them critical accounting estimates 

we use an expected stockprice volatility assumption that is a combination of both current and historical implied volatilities of the underlying stock which are obtained from public data sources this approach is used as a predictor of future realized and implied volatilities and is directly related to stock option valuation for stock option grants issued during the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 we used a weightedaverage expected stockprice volatility of 24 based upon the implied volatility at the time of issuance 

with regard to the weightedaverage option life assumption we consider the exercise behavior of past grants and model the pattern of aggregate exercises patterns are determined based on specific criteria of the aggregate pool of optionees including the reaction to vesting realizable value longrun exercise propensity pentup demand stock runup effect and shorttimetomaturity effect for stock option grants issued during the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 we used a weightedaverage expected option life assumption of approximately 8 years 

w hile we believe the above critical estimates are based on outcomes that are reasonably likely to occur if we were to increase or decrease the expected option life by one year and simultaneously increase or decrease the expected volatility by 100 basis points recognized compensation expense would have changed approximately 20 million in either direction for the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 

quantitative analysis 

during the threeyear period ended june 30 2007 there have not been material changes in the assumptions underlying these critical accounting policies nor to the related significant estimates with the exception of our tax settlement with the internal revenue service in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 which finalized the ultimate liability for exposures which were previously inestimable see “results of operations  fiscal 2006 as compared with fiscal 2005 – provision for income taxes ” the results of our business underlying these assumptions have not differed significantly from our expectations 

while we believe that the estimates that we have made are proper and the related results of operations for the period are presented fairly in all material respects other assumptions could reasonably be justified that would change the amount of reported net sales cost of sales operating expenses or our provision for income taxes as they relate to the provisions for anticipated sales returns allowance for doubtful accounts inventory obsolescence reserve and income taxes for fiscal 2007 had these estimates been changed simultaneously by 25 in either direction our reported gross profit would have increased or decreased by approximately 47 million operating expenses would have changed by approximately 06 million and the provision for income taxes would have increased or decreased by approximately 14 million the collective impact of these changes on operating income net earnings and net earnings per diluted common share would be an increase or decrease of approximately 53 million 67 million and 03 respectively 

results of operations 

overview 

we manufacture market and sell skin care makeup fragrance and hair care products which are distributed in over 135 countries and territories we believe that the best way to increase stockholder value is to provide our customers and consumers with the products and services that they have come to expect from us in the most efficient and profitable manner with this goal in mind we have developed a longterm strategy based on the following five imperatives 

1   optimize brand portfolio

2   strengthen product categories

3   strengthen and expand geographic presence

4   diversify and strengthen distribution channels

5   achieve operational and cost excellence

in fiscal 2007 we continued to find ways to strengthen our core brands and product categories maximize highgrowth brands incubate and develop next generation brands and divest nonstrategic brands net sales from estée lauder and clinique grew on a global basis fueled by strong demand overseas our faster growing mac bobbi brown la mer jo malone and aveda brands continued to grow in virtually all regions and we acquired the remaining equity interest in bumble and bumble sean john unforgivable continued to be a success at retail in north america and we rolled out the brand in certain international markets during fiscal 2007 we launched products under the tom ford brand name in north america and europe and entered into a license agreement with ford motor company to create a fragrance using the name mustang in july 2007 we acquired the ojon corporation a privately held hair care and skin care company based in canada in august 2007 we sold rodan  fields back to its founders 

the majority of our net sales continue to be generated outside the united states around the globe we generated growth in sales and profits in our travel retail business and increased our presence in china and russia we also acquired a distributor in turkey and established an affiliate in brazil 

in alternative distribution channels we continued to grow our online business in north america where products from most of our brands are available at companyowned websites however in order to streamline this business we terminated our majorityowned glosscom joint venture in addition we recently expanded the online business into the united kingdom australia and france certain of our products are now available at specialty retailers such as sephora ulta and shoppers drug mart we made strategic investments to establish the platform upon which we intend to build our pharmacy channel business in europe origins has recently expanded into the french pharmacy channel we also began to expand the number of companyowned jo malone retail stores in europe including the brand’s first french store in cannes 

we continued to make progress on our strategic modernization initiative “smi” in may 2007 our aveda operating unit began using sap software a critical part of smi we anticipate smi implementation will continue at additional locations in fiscal 2008 with the majority of our locations to be implemented through fiscal 2010 

despite the rise in energy and raw material costs we were able to improve our overall cost of goods margin by negotiating new contracts with suppliers and achieving significant savings by sourcing from asia we also reduced the number of our global manufacturing and distribution facilities by increasing the use of thirdparties to control shipping and warehousing costs in addition we improved speed to market of new skus and expanded our hub warehouse concept which allows us to take components on a justintime basis 

during fiscal 2007 we also faced challenges many of which we expect to be ongoing in fiscal 2008 for instance we continue to see challenges for certain of our core brands due in part to the consolidation and changes taking place among retailers and the decline in effectiveness of giftwithpurchase promotions in addition the fragrance business model continues to be a challenge with even the most successful launches having difficulty becoming profitable efforts to expand geographically are complicated by increasing regulatory issues and cultural barriers 

as we continue to implement our strategic imperatives we expect to make selective investments embark on new business endeavors and pursue initiatives that we believe will have longterm benefits the timing impact and magnitude of any particular actions such as an acquisition to strengthen our product categories andor diversify our distribution channels are subject to numerous factors and cannot be predicted 

the following table is a comparative summary of operating results from continuing operations for fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 and reflects the basis of presentation described in note 2 and note 17 to the notes to consolidated financial statements for all periods presented products and services that do not meet our definition of skin care makeup fragrance and hair care have been included in the “other” category 

   

 refer to the following discussion in “fiscal 2006 as compared with fiscal 2005 – operating expenses” for further information regarding these charges 

the following table presents certain consolidated earnings data as a percentage of net sales 

   

in order to meet the demands of consumers we continually introduce new products support new and established products through advertising sampling and merchandising and phase out existing products that no longer meet the needs of our consumers the economics of developing producing launching and supporting products influence our sales and operating performance each period the introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products which we take into account in our business planning 

fiscal 2007 as compared with fiscal 2006 

net sales net sales increased 9 or 5737 million to 70375 million reflecting net sales growth in all product categories and geographic regions the increases in our skin care makeup and fragrance product categories were led by europe the middle east  africa while the increase in hair care net sales was predominantly in the americas excluding the impact of foreign currency translation net sales increased 7 

product categories 

skin care 

net sales of skin care products increased 8 or 2002 million to 26010 million most of this growth was fueled by new product launches which made their most significant impact in our europe the middle east  africa and asiapacific regions the recent launches of advanced night repair concentrate recovery boosting treatment and idealist refinisher from estée lauder and repairwear lift firming night cream continuous rescue antioxidant moisturizer all about eyes rich and repairwear contour firming formula from clinique contributed incremental sales of approximately 95 million combined net sales increases from our fastgrowing la mer brand resilience lift extreme ultra firming products and other existing advanced night repair products from estée lauder along with products in the clinique 3step skin care system and superdefense from clinique totaled approximately 97 million these improvements were partially offset by approximately 35 million of lower sales from certain other resilience lift products and perfectionist cp from estée lauder excluding the impact of foreign currency translation skin care net sales increased 6 

makeup 

makeup net sales increased 8 or 2085 million to 27127 million reflecting growth from our makeup artist brands of approximately 191 million this increase was supported by new points of distribution and new product launches as well as m·a·c viva glam lip products the proceeds of which are donated to aidsrelated charities higher sales of double wear foundation and the recent launch of resilience lift extreme ultra firming makeup spf 15 by estée lauder contributed approximately 56 million to the growth in this product category lower sales of approximately 35 million of pure color gloss and individualist natural finish makeup by estée lauder and repairwear antiaging makeup spf 15 by clinique partially offset this growth excluding the impact of foreign currency translation makeup net sales increased 6 

fragrance 

net sales of fragrance products increased 8 or 953 million to 13086 million primarily driven by incremental international sales from newer fragrance offerings dkny red delicious pure white linen from estée lauder sean john unforgivable dkny red delicious men and donna karan gold collectively contributed approximately 128 million to the category lower sales of approximately 67 million of true star and true star men by tommy hilfiger and estée lauder pleasures partially offset the growth in this product category while current year sales levels compared favorably to the prior year we anticipate continued challenges in this product category due in part to competitive dynamics particularly in the united states excluding the impact of foreign currency translation fragrance net sales increased 5 

hair care 

hair care net sales increased 18 or 584 million to 3771 million primarily due to sales growth from aveda and bumble and bumble products aveda net sales increases were primarily due to sales of professional color products the recent launch of be curly shampoo and conditioner and the acquisition of an independent distributor bumble and bumble sales benefited from a new hotel amenities program sales growth in its existing salon distribution and new points of distribution excluding the impact of foreign currency translation hair care net sales increased 17 

geographic regions 

net sales in the americas increased 3 or 1145 million to 35609 million the increase was led by growth in the united states of approximately 152 million from our makeup artist brands our hair care business our internet distribution and the recent launch of the unforgivable fragrance by sean john partially offsetting this growth was approximately 90 million related to weaknesses in our core brands as a result of competitive pressures and retailer consolidations net sales growth in canada latin america and mexico contributed an additional 31 million to the increase the prior year results reflected an incremental provision of approximately 16 million for returns that were anticipated at that time as a result of thenannounced store closings from retailer consolidations 

in europe the middle east  africa net sales increased 16 or 3457 million to 24934 million including an exchange rate benefit due to the weakening of the us dollar of approximately 122 million the growth in the region reflected higher net sales of approximately 260 million in the united kingdom our travel retail business russia germany and spain with all benefiting from an improving retail environment and in turkey where we acquired a distributor on a local currency basis net sales in europe the middle east  africa increased 10 

net sales in asiapacific increased 13 or 1135 million to 9832 million the growth in this region reflected higher net sales of approximately 86 million in korea china hong kong and australia these markets benefited from an improved economy across the region while china’s growth in net sales primarily reflected our continuing strategic expansion in this country we also experienced modest sales growth in japan our largest market in this region excluding the impact of foreign currency translation asiapacific net sales increased 11 

we strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market which may account for differences in regional sales growth 

cost of sales cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales decreased to 252 as compared with 261 in the prior year cost of sales as a percentage of net sales reflected a favorable change in the mix of our business of approximately 40 basis points a decrease in the level and timing of promotional activities of approximately 20 basis points the effect of exchange rate translation of approximately 20 basis points and a decrease in obsolescence charges of approximately 10 basis points certain of these items reflect savings achieved during the current period from our cost savings initiative which commenced during fiscal 2006 

since certain promotional activities are a component of sales or cost of sales and the timing and level of promotions vary with our promotional calendar we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in the cost of sales percentage in addition future cost of sales mix may be impacted by the inclusion of new brands which have margin and product cost structures different from those of our existing brands 

operating expenses operating expenses improved to 641 of net sales as compared with 643 of net sales in the prior year during the prior year we recorded a 921 million charge to operating expenses related to the implementation of our cost savings initiative that negatively impacted our operating expense margin by approximately 140 basis points partially offsetting this improvement was an increase of approximately 50 basis points in selling general and administrative expenses reflecting higher demonstration field selling and training costs in support of our business in fiscal 2007 our operating expense margin was negatively impacted by approximately 40 basis points resulting from expenses related to our pharmacy channel for organizational costs costs to streamline the distribution of goods and the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets an increase in costs incurred related to the implementation of our strategic modernization initiative and higher stockbased compensation expenses lowered our operating expense margin by approximately 20 additional basis points combined overall operating expenses reflected savings achieved during the current period from our cost savings initiative which commenced during fiscal 2006 

changes in advertising merchandising and sampling spending result from the type timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts as well as the markets being emphasized 

operating results due to the growth in net sales and the decreases in our cost of sales and operating expense margins as previously discussed operating income increased 21 or 1303 million to 7499 million as compared with the prior year operating margins were 107 of net sales as compared with 96 in the prior year which was negatively impacted by 14 of net sales as a result of the special charge related to our cost savings initiative 

the following discussions of operating results by product categories and geographic regions exclude the impact of special charges related to our cost savings initiative of 11 million and 921 million for the fiscal years ended june 30 2007 and 2006 respectively we believe the following analysis of operating results better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business see note 17 of notes to consolidated financial statements  segment data and related information  

product categories 

fragrance operating results increased over 100 or 204 million to 281 million as profits from higher international net sales and lower spending at certain of our core brands in the united states more than offset spending behind new and developing brands hair care operating results grew 60 or 160 million to 425 million as the increase in net sales outpaced increased spending in support of new distribution points and product launches operating results increased 3 or 99 million to 3393 million in makeup primarily as a result of higher net sales and profits from our makeup artist brands which more than offset challenges among certain core brands skin care operating results decreased 1 or 49 million to 3415 million the results in this product category were negatively impacted in fiscal 2007 by charges related to our pharmacy channel we recorded approximately 30 million for organizational costs costs to streamline the distribution of goods and the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets in addition improvements in international skin care results were partially offset by challenges in certain core brands in the united states 

geographic regions 

operating income in the americas decreased 2 or 77 million to 3364 million reflecting spending behind strategic initiatives at our core brands retailer consolidation and costs to develop new brands in the united states operating income growth from our makeup artist brands hair care business and our internet distribution partially offset these results 

in europe the middle east  africa operating income increased 8 or 239 million to 3214 million primarily due to higher results of approximately 49 million from our travel retail business the united kingdom russia and germany lower results from france partially offset these improvements by approximately 10 million the current year operating results in france reflected the rebalancing of inventory levels at certain retailers as well as strategic investment spending behind the field sales force during the current year the region was negatively impacted by the charges discussed above related to our pharmacy channel partially offset by modest combined operating income growth from the remaining affiliates in this region 

in asiapacific operating income increased 33 or 231 million to 932 million this increase reflected improved results of approximately 23 million in hong kong china australia and korea 

interest expense net net interest expense was 389 million as compared with 238 million in the prior year this change primarily resulted from higher average debt balances primarily associated with the funding of our accelerated share repurchase program and higher average interest rates also contributing to the increase was reduced interest income generated from lower average investment balances internationally partially offset by higher average investment rates these increases were partially offset by the capitalization of interest expense on internally developed software in connection with the upgrade of our information systems 

provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes represents federal foreign state and local income taxes the effective rate differs from statutory rates due to the effect of state and local taxes tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and certain nondeductible expenses our effective tax rate will change from quarter to quarter based on nonrecurring and recurring factors including but not limited to the geographical mix of earnings enacted tax legislation state and local taxes tax audit settlements and the interaction of various global tax strategies the effective rate for income taxes for the year ended june 30 2007 was 359 as compared with 436 in the prior year the decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily attributable to the prior year effect of the irs tax settlement of approximately 770 basis points 

discontinued operations on september 30 2005 we committed to a plan to sell and on april 10 2006 we completed the sale of certain assets and operations of our reporting unit that marketed and sold stila brand products for the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 05 million net of tax of operating income was reflected as discontinued operations reflecting the conclusion of transitional distribution services provided to the purchaser the prior year charge of 803 million net of tax reflected the thenanticipated loss on the sale of the business of 699 million net of tax and the operating loss of 104 million net of tax 

net earnings net earnings as compared with the prior fiscal year increased 2050 million to 4492 million and diluted net earnings per common share improved 93 from 112 to 216 net earnings from continuing operations as compared with the prior fiscal year increased by 1242 million or 38 to 4487 million and diluted net earnings per common share from continuing operations increased 45 from 149 to 216 

fiscal 2006 as compared with fiscal 2005 

net sales net sales increased 3 or 1838 million to 64638 million due to growth in our makeup skin care and hair care product categories which was partially offset by lower sales in our fragrance product category the net increase reflected sales growth in all geographic regions excluding the impact of foreign currency translation net sales increased 4 

product categories skin care 

net sales of skin care products increased 2 or 487 million to 24008 million primarily due to new product launches the fiscal 2006 launches of resilience lift extreme ultra firming cremes and renutriv ultimate lifting serum by estée lauder and turnaround concentrate visible skin renewer and turnaround 15minute facial by clinique generated incremental sales of approximately 123 million combined perfectionist cp by estée lauder and products in clinique’s 3step skin care system bolstered by the introduction of liquid facial soap contributed approximately 78 million to the increase these improvements were offset by approximately 157 million of decreases in sales of existing products in certain of our core brands as well as declines in our beautybank brands which completed their initial rollout during fiscal 2005 excluding the impact of foreign currency translation skin care net sales increased 3 

makeup 

makeup net sales increased 6 or 1374 million to 25042 million reflecting growth from our makeup artist brands of approximately 179 million this growth was partially offset by approximately 72 million of lower sales from certain existing products reflecting challenges experienced by certain of our core brands and declines in our beautybank brands which completed their initial rollout during fiscal 2005 excluding the impact of foreign currency translation makeup net sales increased 7 

fragrance 

net sales of fragrance products decreased 4 or 473 million to 12133 million as we continued to be challenged in this product category particularly in the americas region estée lauder beyond paradise and various fragrances from clinique and tommy hilfiger generated approximately 106 million of lower sales also contributing to the decrease were lower sales of approximately 28 million of true star by tommy hilfiger and lauder beyond paradise men by estée lauder as we anniversaried the initial shipments of those products in fiscal 2005 these decreases were partially offset by the fiscal 2006 launches of true star men by tommy hilfiger and unforgivable by sean john which collectively contributed approximately 49 million to the category and higher sales of approximately 47 million of dkny be delicious and estée lauder pleasures  excluding the impact of foreign currency translation fragrance net sales decreased 2

hair care 

hair care net sales increased 16 or 448 million to 3187 million primarily due to sales growth from bumble and bumble and aveda products bumble and bumble sales benefited from sales growth due to new points of distribution increases in sales of core products and the launches of shine and powder products aveda net sales increases benefited from the fiscal 2006 launch of damage remedy hair care products strong demand for color products and from the acquisition of a distributor excluding the impact of foreign currency translation hair care net sales increased 17 

geographic regions 

net sales in the americas increased 3 or 953 million to 34464 million the increase was led by growth in the united states of approximately 190 million from our makeup artist and hair care brands our internet distribution and the introduction of the unforgivable fragrance by sean john partially offsetting this growth was approximately 122 million related to weaknesses in certain of our core brands as a result of challenges from competitive pressures and business disruptions at certain key retailers and lower sales from our beautybank brands which completed their initial rollout during fiscal 2005 net sales growth in canada latin america and mexico contributed an additional 48 million to the increase 

in europe the middle east  africa net sales increased 2 or 386 million to 21477 million reflecting higher net sales of approximately 64 million from our travel retail and distributor businesses russia and the united kingdom with all benefiting from the success of the dkny be delicious franchise and the sale of m ž a ž c products these increases were partially offset by decreases of approximately 26 million in spain and italy spain’s net sales were adversely affected by changes to our distribution policy and a difficult retail environment net sales in italy were negatively impacted by changes to our distribution policy and to a lesser extent the balancing of inventory levels at its retailers on a local currency basis net sales in europe the middle east  africa increased 5

net sales in asiapacific increased 6 or 499 million to 8697 million strategic growth in china combined with positive results in korea and hong kong contributed approximately 57 million to sales growth in this region these increases were partially offset by decreases in japan and australia of approximately 18 million japan’s results were negatively impacted due to the strengthening of the us dollar against the japanese yen the decrease in australia reflected slower sellthrough in a difficult retail environment particularly in the fragrance category as well as the balancing of inventory levels at a major retailer on a local currency basis net sales in asiapacific increased 7 

we strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market which may account for differences in regional sales growth 

cost of sales cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales increased to 261 as compared with 255 in fiscal 2005 this change reflected an increase in obsolescence charges of approximately 40 basis points the net change in the mix of our business within our geographic regions and product categories of approximately 20 basis points a charge related to unutilized tooling of approximately 10 basis points and 20 basis points related to commodity material prices partially offsetting these increases were favorable changes in promotional activities of approximately 30 basis points the higher price of oil resulted in price increases in certain oilbased chemicals which had a slight adverse effect on our cost of sales margin 

since certain promotional activities are a component of net sales or cost of sales and the timing and level of promotions vary with our promotional calendar we have experienced fluctuations in the cost of sales percentage 

operating expenses operating expenses increased to 643 of net sales as compared with 629 of net sales in fiscal 2005 the fiscal 2006 operating expense margin was negatively impacted by charges related to the implementation of our cost savings initiative of approximately 921 million or approximately 140 basis points costs related to stockbased compensation as a result of the fiscal 2006 adoption of sfas no 123r of approximately 60 basis points and the estimated impact of both the merger of federated department stores inc and the may department stores company and the hurricanes that affected the southern united states of approximately 40 basis points partially offsetting these incremental costs were operating expense margin improvements of approximately 90 basis points primarily resulting from net sales growth in brands and channels with lower advertising merchandising and sampling cost structures as well as an overall reduction in this type of spending overall operating expenses reflected savings achieved during fiscal 2006 from our cost savings initiative 

changes in advertising sampling and merchandising spending result from the type timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts as well as the markets being emphasized 

during fiscal 2006 we recorded special charges associated with a cost savings initiative that was designed to support our longterm financial objectives as part of this multifaceted initiative we identified savings opportunities that include streamlined processes and organizational changes the principal component of the initiative was a voluntary separation program offered primarily to north americabased employees during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 involuntary separations were communicated to certain employees under this initiative we incurred expenses related to onetime termination benefits for 494 employees of which 28 were involuntary which benefits were based principally upon years of service 

in addition we identified other cost savings opportunities to improve efficiencies in our distribution network and product offerings and to eliminate other nonessential costs these charges primarily related to employee severance for facilities that are closing contract cancellations counter and door closings and product returns 

for the year ended june 30 2006 aggregate expenses of 921 million were recorded as special charges related to the cost savings initiative in the accompanying consolidated statement of earnings 

the following table summarizes the costs and expected savings associated with our cost savings initiative which impacted and will continue to impact our operating expenses and cost of sales 

   

operating results operating income decreased 15 or 1072 million to 6196 million operating margin was 96 of net sales in fiscal 2006 as compared with 116 in fiscal 2005 these results were negatively impacted by the effects of special charges related to our cost savings initiative of 921 million or 14 of net sales in addition to the special charges net sales growth was more than offset by the increases in our cost of sales and operating expense margins as previously discussed 

the following discussions of operating results by product categories and geographic regions exclude the impact of special charges related to the implementation of our cost savings initiative we believe the following analysis of operating results better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business

product categories 

operating income declined 79 or 281 million to 77 million in the fragrance product category reflecting lower sales and to a lesser extent expenses incurred related to development of new products and brands partially offset by a shift in spending in certain of our core brands to other product categories skin care operating income decreased 5 or 194 million to 3464 million primarily reflecting lower than anticipated net sales in certain of our core brands operating income increased 9 or 283 million to 3294 million in the makeup product category primarily reflecting sales growth from our makeup artist brands partially offset by declines in certain of our core brands hair care operating income increased 16 or 37 million to 265 million reflecting worldwide sales growth in fiscal 2006 the merger of federated department stores inc and the may department stores company had a negative impact on the operating results of our skin care makeup and fragrance product categories while incremental operating expenses associated with new accounting rules for stockbased compensation negatively impacted all of our product categories 

geographic regions 

operating income in the americas decreased 6 or 221 million to 3441 million primarily reflecting challenges experienced by certain of our core brands due in part to competitive pressures and retailer consolidations and incremental operating expenses of approximately 33 million associated with new accounting rules for stockbased compensation the ongoing success of our makeup artist and hair care brands and our internet distribution partially offset these challenges 

in europe the middle east  africa operating income decreased 3 or 78 million to 2975 million this decrease was primarily due to lower results in spain benelux belgium the netherlands and luxembourg and italy of approximately 20 million collectively these decreases were partially offset by improvements of approximately 12 million in france our travel retail business and central europe hungary poland and czech republic 

in asiapacific operating income increased 27 or 148 million to 701 million this increase reflects improved results of approximately 16 million in korea japan and china partially offset by lower results in taiwan and thailand of approximately 4 million collectively as china is an emerging market for us we have invested and plan to continue to invest in new brand expansion and business opportunities there 

interest expense net net interest expense was 238 million as compared with 139 million in fiscal 2005 the increase in net interest expense was primarily due to higher average interest rates and to a lesser extent higher average debt balances due to outstanding commercial paper during the year the increased expense was partially offset by increased interest income related to higher investment interest rates 

provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes represents federal foreign state and local income taxes the effective rate for income taxes for fiscal 2006 was 436 as compared with 412 in fiscal 2005 the effective rate differs from statutory rates due to the effect of state and local taxes tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and certain nondeductible expenses the company’s effective tax rate will change from year to year based on nonrecurring and recurring factors including but not limited to the geographic mix of earnings enacted tax legislation state and local taxes tax audit findings and settlements and the interaction of various global tax strategies 

on july 13 2006 we announced a settlement with the internal revenue service “irs” regarding its examination of our consolidated federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended june 30 1998 through june 30 2001 the settlement resolves previously disclosed issues raised during the irs’s examination including transfer pricing and foreign tax credit computations the settlement of these issues resulted in a tax charge of approximately 46 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and represents the aggregate earnings impact of the settlement through fiscal 2006 in addition during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 we completed the repatriation of foreign earnings through intercompany dividends as required under the provisions of the american jobs creation act of 2004 the “ajca” in connection with the repatriation we updated the computation of the related aggregate tax impact resulting in a favorable adjustment of approximately 11 million the tax settlement coupled with the ajca favorable tax adjustment resulted in a net increase to our fiscal 2006 income tax provision of approximately 35 million 

the increase in the effective income tax rate was attributable to the tax settlement charge of approximately 770 basis points an increase of approximately 60 basis points resulting from our foreign operations and an increase in nondeductible expenses of approximately 30 basis points these increases were partially offset by the net reduction in the incremental tax charge relative to the repatriation of foreign earnings pursuant to the ajca of approximately 570 basis points as well as a reduction of approximately 50 basis points for miscellaneous items 

discontinued operations on april 10 2006 the “effective date” we completed the sale of certain assets and operations of the reporting unit that marketed and sold stila brand products to stila corp the “purchaser” an affiliate of sun capital partners inc for consideration of 230 million the sale price included cash of 93 million a promissory note with a notional value of 133 million and a fair value of 110 million and convertible preferred stock with an aggregate liquidation preference of 50 million and a fair value of 27 million as additional consideration for the purchased assets and subject to the terms and conditions of the sale agreement the purchaser will pay us an amount equal to two percent of the annual net sales of the acquired business during the period commencing on the effective date and ending august 20 2019 we will use these proceeds to satisfy our commitment under the 1999 agreement pursuant to which we originally purchased the stila business the purchaser immediately assumed responsibility for all decisions regarding the operations of the stila business and we agreed to divest ourselves of continuing involvement in the stila business except as described below 

in fiscal 2006 we recorded charges of 803 million net of 433 million tax benefit to discontinued operations which reflected the loss on the disposition of the business of 699 million net of tax and adjustments to the fair value of assets sold the costs to dispose of those assets not acquired by the purchaser and other costs in connection with the sale the charges also included the operating losses of 104 million net of tax for the fiscal year ended june 30 2006 net sales associated with the discontinued operations were 451 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2006 all statements of earnings information for previous years has been restated for comparative purposes including the restatement of the makeup product category and each of the geographic regions presented in note 17 of notes to consolidated financial statements  segment data and related information  

in order to facilitate the transition of the stila business to the purchaser we agreed to provide certain information systems accounting and other back office services to the purchaser in exchange for monthly service fees designed to recover the estimated costs of providing these transition services we also agreed with the purchaser to provide certain distribution and online services in both cases the services concluded in fiscal 2007 in addition we agreed to manufacture and sell to the purchaser a limited range of products for a period of up to four months following the effective date and in the case of one product of up to two years 

net earnings net earnings as compared with fiscal 2005 declined 1619 million or 40 to 2442 million and diluted net earnings per common share decreased 37 from 178 to 112 net earnings from continuing operations as compared with fiscal 2005 decreased by 854 million or 21 to 3245 million and diluted net earnings per common share from continuing operations decreased 17 from 180 to 149 

financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations and borrowings under commercial paper borrowings from the issuance of longterm debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks and other lenders in the united states and abroad at june 30 2007 we had cash and cash equivalents of 2537 million compared with 3686 million at june 30 2006 

at june 30 2007 our outstanding borrowings were as follows 

   

1   consists of 3000 million principal and unamortized debt discount of 38 million

2   consists of 3000 million principal unamortized debt discount of 05 million and an 86 million adjustment to reflect the fair value of outstanding interest rate swaps

3   consists of 2500 million principal unamortized debt discount of 05 million and a 98 million adjustment to reflect the remaining termination value of an interest rate swap that is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt

4   consists of 2000 million principal and unamortized debt discount of 26 million

we have a 7500 million commercial paper program under which we may issue commercial paper in the united states our commercial paper is currently rated a1 by standard  poor’s and p1 by moody’s our longterm credit ratings are a with a stable outlook by standard  poor’s and a2 with a stable outlook by moody’s at june 30 2007 we had 265 million of commercial paper outstanding which we may refinance on a periodic basis as it matures at thenprevailing market interest rates we also have 1789 million in additional uncommitted credit facilities of which 289 million was used as of june 30 2007 

effective april 2007 we entered into a 7500 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility expiring on april 26 2012 primarily to provide credit support for our commercial paper program to repurchase shares of our common stock and for general corporate purposes the new facility replaced our prior undrawn 6000 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility which had been effective since may 27 2005 up to the equivalent of 250 million of the current facility is available for multicurrency loans the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on libor or on the higher of prime which is the rate of interest publicly announced by the administrative agent or ½ plus the federal funds rate we incurred costs of approximately 03 million to establish the facility which will be amortized over the term of the facility the credit facility has an annual fee of 04 million payable quarterly based on our current credit ratings as of june 30 2007 we were in compliance with all related financial and other restrictive covenants including limitations on indebtedness and liens 

in may 2007 we issued and sold the 2017 senior notes and the 2037 senior notes in a public offering the 2017 senior notes were priced at 99845 with a yield of 5570 and the 2037 senior notes were priced at 98722 with a yield of 6093 interest payments on both notes are required to be made semiannually on may 15 and november 15 commencing november 15 2007 we used the net proceeds of this offering to repay longterm commercial paper which was used to fund our accelerated stock repurchase program and to pay transaction fees and expenses related to this offering 

we have a fixed rate promissory note agreement with a financial institution pursuant to which we may borrow up to 1500 million in the form of loan participation notes through one of our subsidiaries in europe the interest rate on borrowings under this agreement is at an allin fixed rate determined by the lender and agreed to by us at the date of each borrowing at june 30 2007 no borrowings were outstanding under this agreement debt issuance costs incurred related to this agreement were de minimis 

we have an overdraft borrowing agreement with a financial institution pursuant to which our subsidiary in turkey may be credited to satisfy outstanding negative daily balances arising from its business operations the total balance outstanding at any time shall not exceed 200 million turkish lira the interest rate applicable to each such credit shall be 40 basis points per annum above the spot rate charged by the lender or the lender’s floating call rate agreed to by us at each borrowing there were no debt issuance costs incurred related to this agreement the outstanding balance at june 30 2007 94 million at the exchange rate at june 30 2007 is classified as shortterm debt in our consolidated balance sheet 

we have a 30 billion yen revolving credit facility that expires on march 24 2009 the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on tibor tokyo interbank offered rate and a 10 basis point facility fee is incurred on the undrawn balance at june 30 2007 no borrowings were outstanding under this facility 

our business is seasonal in nature and accordingly our working capital needs vary from time to time we may enter into investing and financing transactions that require additional funding to the extent that these needs exceed cash from operations we could subject to market conditions issue commercial paper issue longterm debt securities or borrow under our revolving credit facilities 

total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 48 at june 30 2007 and 24 at june 30 2006 

the effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years generally we have been able to introduce new products at higher selling prices or increase selling prices sufficiently to offset cost increases which have been moderate 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that cash on hand cash generated from operations available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business operations information systems enhancements capital expenditures stock repurchases commitments and other contractual obligations on both a nearterm and longterm basis 

cash flows 

net cash provided by operating activities was 6616 million 7098 million and 4781 million in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the net decrease in operating cash flows from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 reflected higher domestic and international inventory levels primarily driven by growth in new and emerging international markets increased regulatory requirements and the building of safety stock for the recent implementation of sap as part of our strategic modernization initiative at our aveda manufacturing facility in addition the decrease in operating cash flows reflected higher accounts receivable balances primarily related to significant sales growth from our international operations cash flows were also impacted by cash payments made during fiscal 2007 related to our fiscal 2006 cost savings initiative partially offsetting the decrease was an improvement in net earnings from continuing operations 

the net increase in operating cash flows for fiscal 2006 as compared with fiscal 2005 primarily reflected favorable changes in certain working capital accounts partially offset by a decrease in net earnings from continuing operations net accounts receivable balances decreased primarily reflecting higher collections domestically during fiscal 2006 inventory levels remained constant at june 30 2006 as compared to june 30 2005 due to our efforts to better manage our inventory increases in other accrued liabilities primarily reflected higher advertising merchandising and sampling accruals compared to fiscal 2005 as well as significant deferred compensation and supplemental pension payments made to retired executives in fiscal 2005 additional increases in other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities reflected accrued employee separation benefits related to the company’s fiscal 2006 cost savings initiative 

net cash used for investing activities was 3738 million 3032 million and 2370 million in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 the increase in cash flows used for investing activities as compared with fiscal 2006 primarily reflected capital expenditures which reflected our continuing companywide initiative to upgrade our information systems store improvements and counter construction fiscal 2007 investing activities also reflected the purchase of the remaining equity interest in bumble and bumble products llc and bumble and bumble llc as well as the acquisition of businesses engaged in the wholesale distribution and retail sale of our products in the united states and other countries the increase in cash flows used for investing activities during fiscal 2006 primarily reflected the cash payment related to the jo malone limited earnout provision and to a lesser extent aveda distributor acquisitions capital expenditures also increased in fiscal 2006 primarily reflecting our continued companywide initiative to upgrade our information systems which was initiated in fiscal 2005 fiscal 2005 capital expenditures reflected those costs related to our information systems as well as the investment in leasehold improvements for our corporate offices 

cash used for financing activities was 4116 million 5946 million and 3004 million in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively net cash flows related to shortterm and longterm borrowings increased approximately 7221 million from the prior year an increase in proceeds from employee stock transactions of approximately 87 million also contributed to the improvement partially offsetting these improvements were increases in treasury stock repurchases of approximately 604 million and an increase of approximately 18 million in dividends paid to stockholders during fiscal 2006 in addition to common stock repurchases and dividend payments cash flows used for financing activities reflected the repayment of shortterm commercial paper that was outstanding at june 30 2005 and the october 2005 redemption of the remaining 2015 preferred stock these outflows were partially offset by shortterm borrowings under our loan participation note program the 30 billion yen term loan outstanding at the end of fiscal 2005 was refinanced by borrowings under the new 30 billion yen revolving credit facility that we entered into in march 2006 the net cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2005 primarily reflected common stock repurchases and dividend payments partially offset by the issuance of shortterm commercial paper to fund working capital needs and the receipt of proceeds from employee stock option transactions 

dividends 

on october 25 2006 the board of directors declared an annual dividend of 50 per share on our class a and class b common stock of which an aggregate of 1036 million was paid on december 27 2006 to stockholders of record at the close of business on december 8 2006 the annual common stock dividend declared during fiscal 2006 was 40 per share of which an aggregate of 854 million was paid on december 28 2005 to stockholders of record at the close of business on december 9 2005 dividends on the 2015 preferred stock were 05 million for fiscal 2006 and were characterized as interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of earnings 2015 preferred stock was redeemed in october 2005 

pension plan funding and expense 

we maintain pension plans covering substantially all of our fulltime employees for our us operations and a majority of our international operations several plans provide pension benefits based primarily on years of service and employees’ earnings in the united states we maintain a trustbased noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan “us qualified plan” additionally we have an unfunded nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations our international pension plans are comprised of defined benefit and defined contribution plans 

several factors influence our annual funding requirements for the us qualified plan our funding policy consists of annual contributions at a rate that provides for future plan benefits and maintains appropriate funded percentages such contribution is not less than the minimum required by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended “erisa” and subsequent pension legislation and is not more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes for each international plan our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations in addition amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions as detailed in “ critical accounting polices and estimates ” the effect of our pension plan funding on future operating results will depend on economic conditions employee demographics mortality rates the number of participants electing to take lumpsum distributions investment performance and funding decisions 

for fiscal 2007 and 2006 there was no minimum contribution to the us qualified plan required by erisa during the first quarter of fiscal 2007 the pension protection act of 2006 was adopted into law in the united states certain provisions of this law changed the calculation related to the maximum contribution amount deductible for income tax purposes as a result of these provisions we made discretionary contributions totaling 200 million to the us qualified plan during fiscal 2007 we did not make any cash contributions pursuant to the plan during fiscal 2006 during fiscal 2008 we expect to make cash contributions totaling 200 million to the us qualified plan 

for fiscal 2007 and 2006 we made benefit payments under our nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan of 53 million and 74 million respectively we expect to make benefit payments under this plan during fiscal 2008 of 117 million for fiscal 2007 and 2006 we made cash contributions to our international defined benefit pension plans of 240 million and 257 million respectively we expect to make contributions under these plans during fiscal 2008 of 210 million 

in september 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 106 and 132r” “sfas no 158” sfas no 158 requires employers to recognize a net liability or asset and an offsetting adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income to report the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans previous standards required employers to disclose the complete funded status of its plans only in the notes to the financial statements changes in the funded status of these plans will be recognized as they occur through other comprehensive income additional minimum liability adjustments are no longer recognized upon adoption of sfas no 158 as of june 30 2007 we prospectively adopted the balance sheet recognition provisions of sfas no 158 additionally sfas no 158 requires employers to measure plan assets and obligations at their yearend balance sheet date our principal pension and postretirement benefit plans are measured as of june 30 therefore the measurement provisions of sfas no 158 did not affect our existing valuation practices the adoption of sfas no 158 did not impact the consolidated statements of earnings or our financial debt covenant as of june 30 2007 we recognized other assets of 1280 million other accrued liabilities of 190 million and other noncurrent liabilities of 2373 million on our consolidated balance sheet representing the funded status of our pension and postretirement plans 

prior to the adoption of sfas no 158 we recognized a liability on our balance sheet for each pension plan if the fair market value of the assets of that plan was less than the accumulated benefit obligation and accordingly a benefit or a charge was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity for the change in such liability during fiscal 2006 we recorded a benefit net of deferred tax of 299 million 

commitments and contingencies 

certain of our business acquisition agreements include “earnout” provisions these provisions generally require that we pay to the seller or sellers of the business additional amounts based on the performance of the acquired business   since the size of each payment depends upon performance of the acquired business we do not expect that such payments will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or financial condition 

for additional contingencies refer to “item 3 legal proceedings” 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes scheduled maturities of our contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed and determinable as of june 30 2007 

   

1   includes longterm and shortterm debt and the related projected interest costs and to a lesser extent capital lease commitments refer to note 8 of notes to consolidated financial statements

2   refer to note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements

3   unconditional purchase obligations primarily include inventory commitments estimated future earnout payments estimated royalty payments pursuant to license agreements advertising commitments capital improvement commitments planned funding of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations commitments pursuant to executive compensation arrangements and obligations related to our cost savings initiative future earnout payments and future royalty and advertising commitments were estimated based on planned future sales for the term that was in effect at june 30 2007 without consideration for potential renewal periods

derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 

we address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments we primarily enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates we also enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the effects of fluctuating interest rates we categorize these instruments as entered into for purposes other than trading 

for each derivative contract entered into where we look to obtain special hedge accounting treatment we formally document the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item as well as its riskmanagement objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge the nature of the risk being hedged how the hedging instruments’ effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively and a description of the method of measuring ineffectiveness this process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as fairvalue cashflow or foreigncurrency hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions we also formally assess both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items if it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective then we will be required to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively 

foreign exchange risk management 

we enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge anticipated transactions as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies for periods consistent with our identified exposures the purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on our costs and on the cash flows that we receive from foreign subsidiaries almost all foreign currency contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries and are with large financial institutions rated as strong investment grade by a major rating agency we also may enter into foreign currency options to hedge anticipated transactions where there is a high probability that anticipated exposures will materialize the forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options entered into to hedge anticipated transactions have been designated as cashflow hedges hedge effectiveness of forward exchange contracts is based on a hypothetical derivative methodology and excludes the portion of fair value attributable to the spotforward difference which is recorded in currentperiod earnings hedge effectiveness of foreign currency option contracts is based on a dollar offset methodology the ineffective portion of both forward exchange and foreign currency option contracts is recorded in currentperiod earnings for hedge contracts that are no longer deemed highly effective hedge accounting is discontinued and gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are reclassified to earnings when the underlying forecasted transaction occurs if it is probable that the forecasted transaction will no longer occur then any gains or losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are reclassified to currentperiod earnings as of june 30 2007 these cashflow hedges were highly effective in all material respects 

as a matter of policy we only enter into contracts with counterparties that have at least an “a” or equivalent credit rating the counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions we do not have significant exposure to any one counterparty our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to only the recognized but not realized gains attributable to the contracts management believes risk of default under these hedging contracts is remote and in any event would not be material to the consolidated financial results the contracts have varying maturities through the end of june 2008 costs associated with entering into such contracts have not been material to our consolidated financial results we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

at june 30 2007 we had foreign currency contracts in the form of forward exchange contracts in the amount of 8620 million the foreign currencies included in forward exchange contracts notional value stated in us dollars are principally the british pound 1481 million canadian dollar 1403 million euro 1241 million swiss franc 1131 million australian dollar 793 million japanese yen 426 million and south korean won 336 million as of june 30 2007 all of our previously outstanding option contracts have matured 

interest rate risk management 

we enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the exposure to fluctuations of interest rates on our funded and unfunded indebtedness for periods consistent with the identified exposures all interest rate derivative contracts are with large financial institutions rated as strong investment grade by a major rating agency 

in april 2007 we terminated an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 2500 million to effectively convert fixed rate interest on the 2012 senior notes to variable interest rates based on sixmonth libor this instrument which was designated as a fairvalue hedge and classified as a liability had a termination fair value of 111 million at cash settlement which included 09 million of accrued interest payable to the counterparty hedge accounting treatment was discontinued prospectively and the offsetting adjustment to the carrying amount of the related debt will be amortized to interest expense over the remaining life of the debt 

in april 2007 in connection with the anticipated issuance of debt we entered into a series of forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements on a notional amount totaling 2100 million at a weighted average allin rate of 545 these forwardstarting swap agreements designated as cashflow hedges were used to hedge the exposure to a possible rise in interest rates prior to the may 2007 issuance of debt the agreements were settled upon the issuance of the 2037 senior notes and we recognized a loss in other comprehensive income of 09 million that will be amortized to interest expense over the 30year life of the 2037 senior notes 

in april 2007 we entered into interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount totaling 2500 million to effectively convert the fixed rate interest on our 2017 senior notes to variable interest rates based on sixmonth libor the interest rate swaps were designated as fairvalue hedges as of june 30 2007 these fairvalue hedges were highly effective in all material respects 

market risk 

we use a valueatrisk model to assess the market risk of our derivative financial instruments valueatrisk represents the potential losses for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors for a specified time period and confidence level we estimate valueatrisk across all of our derivative financial instruments using a model with historical volatilities and correlations calculated over the past 250day period the measured valueatrisk calculated as an average for the twelve months ended june 30 2007 related to our foreign exchange contracts and our interest rate contracts was 102 million and 75 million respectively   the model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 percent confidence level we used a statistical simulation model that valued our derivative financial instruments against one thousand randomly generated market price paths 

our calculated valueatrisk exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may or may not occur it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated based upon actual fluctuations in market rates operating exposures and the timing thereof and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year 

we believe however that any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the derivative financial instrument was intended 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not maintain any offbalance sheet arrangements transactions obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations 

recently issued accounting standards 

in june 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation number “fin” 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” “fin 48” fin 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 109 “accounting for income taxes” fin 48 prescribes a twostep evaluation process for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the first step is recognition and the second is measurement for recognition an enterprise judgmentally determines whether it is morelikelythannot that a tax position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position if the tax position meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold it is measured and recognized in the financial statements as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized if a tax position does not meet the morelikelythannot recognition threshold the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements 

tax positions that meet the morelikelythannot recognition threshold at the effective date of fin 48 may be recognized or continue to be recognized upon adoption of fin 48 the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of fin 48 shall be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for that fiscal year fin 48 will apply to fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 with earlier adoption permitted in may 2007 the fasb issued fasb staff position “fsp” no fin 481 “definition of settlement in fasb interpretation no 48 an amendment of fasb interpretation fin no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” “fsp no fin 481” fsp no fin 481 provides guidance on how to determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits 

the provisions of fin 48 became effective for us on july 1 2007 while we are continuing to evaluate the impact of the interpretation on the consolidated financial statements we expect the cumulative effect of adoption to reduce opening retained earnings by approximately 10 million to 20 million with a corresponding increase to reserves for uncertain tax positions 

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard “sfas” no 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas no 157” to clarify the definition of fair value establish a framework for measuring fair value and expand the disclosures on fair value measurements sfas no 157 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date an exit price sfas no 157 also stipulates that as a marketbased measurement fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between a market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs and b the reporting entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances unobservable inputs sfas no 157 becomes effective for us in our fiscal year ending june 30 2009 we are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of sfas no 157 on our consolidated financial statements 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities” “sfas no 159” to permit all entities to choose to elect at specified election dates to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value an entity shall report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date and recognize upfront costs and fees related to those items in earnings as incurred and not deferred sfas no 159 applies to fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 with early adoption permitted for an entity that has also elected to apply the provisions of sfas no 157 an entity is prohibited from retrospectively applying sfas no 159 unless it chooses early adoption we are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of sfas no 159 on our consolidated financial statements if any when it becomes effective for the fiscal year ending june 30 2009

information systems 

information systems support business processes including product development marketing sales order processing production distribution and finance of the many systems currently being utilized the most significant to our business needs are i a centralized data repository of essential attributes for each of the products we offer or plan to offer which enables us to globally manufacture and market products of consistent quality ii a sales analysis system to track weekly sales at the stock keeping unit sku level at most significant retail sales locations ie sellthrough data increasing our understanding of consumer preferences and enabling us to coordinate more effectively our product development manufacturing and marketing strategies iii an automated replenishment system with many of our key domestic customers allowing us to replenish inventories for individual points of sale automatically with minimal paperwork and iv an inventory management system to provide us with a global view of finished goods availability relative to actual requirements facilitating inventory control and distribution for both existing product lines and new product launches 

the efficiencies provided by these systems have resulted in increased sales fewer outofstocks and reduced retail inventories we expect that these systems will continue to provide inventory and sales efficiencies in the short and medium terms as part of our longterm effort to enhance these efficiencies we are implementing our strategic modernization initiative “smi” which includes an enterprisewide global program that we expect will deliver a single set of integrated data processes and technologies which would be scalable and used to standardize business processes across brands operating units and sales affiliates the implementation of smi at our aveda operating unit is planned for fiscal 2007 smi is expected to proceed in stages through fiscal 2010

 item 1a risk factors 

there are risks associated with an investment in our securities 

please consider the following risks and all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k and in our subsequent filings with the sec our business may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial if any of the events contemplated by the following discussion of risks should occur or other risks arise or develop our business prospects financial condition and results of operations as well as the prices of our securities may be adversely affected 

the beauty business is highly competitive and if we are unable to compete effectively our results will suffer 

we face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world including multinational consumer product companies some of these competitors have greater resources than we do and may be able to respond to changing business and economic conditions more quickly than us competition in the beauty business is based on pricing of products innovation perceived value service to the consumer promotional activities advertising special events new product introductions electronic commerce initiatives and other activities it is difficult for us to predict the timing and scale of our competitors’ actions in these areas also the trend toward consolidation in the retail trade particularly in developed markets such as the united states and western europe has resulted in us becoming increasingly dependent on key retailers including largeformat retailers who have increased their bargaining strength this trend has also resulted in an increased risk related to the concentration of our customers a severe adverse impact on their business operations could have a corresponding material adverse effect on us our ability to compete also depends on the continued strength of our brands our ability to attract and retain key talent and other personnel the efficiency of our manufacturing facilities and distribution network and our ability to protect our intellectual property our inability to continue to compete effectively in countries around the world could have an adverse impact on our business 

  

our inability to anticipate and respond to market trends and changes in consumer preferences could adversely affect our financial results 

our continued success depends on our ability to anticipate gauge and react in a timely and costeffective manner to changes in consumer tastes for skin care makeup fragrance and hair care products as well as to where and how consumers shop for those products we must continually work to develop produce and market new products maintain and enhance the recognition of our brands achieve a favorable mix of products and refine our approach as to how and where we market and sell our products while we devote considerable effort and resources to shape analyze and respond to consumer preferences we recognize that consumer tastes cannot be predicted with certainty and can change rapidly if we are unable to anticipate and respond to trends in the market for cosmetics products and changing consumer demands our financial results will suffer 

our future success depends on our ability to achieve our longterm strategy 

our longterm strategy is based on five strategic imperatives 

1   optimize brand portfolio

2   strengthen product categories

3   strengthen and expand geographic presence

4   diversify and strengthen distribution channels

5   achieve operational and cost excellence

achieving our longterm objectives may require investment in new brands categories distribution channels technologies and geographic markets these investments may results in shortterm costs without any current revenues in addition there may be costs incurred in disposing of brands although we believe that our strategic imperatives will lead to growth in revenue and profitability we may not realize in full or in part the anticipated benefits the failure to realize benefits which may be due to our ability to execute plans or other risks described in this 10k could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

any future acquisitions may expose us to additional risks 

we continuously review acquisition opportunities that would expand our current product offerings our distribution channels increase the size and geographic scope of our operations or otherwise offer growth and operating efficiency opportunities the financing for any of these acquisitions could result in an increase in our indebtedness dilute the interests of our stockholders or both acquisitions may entail numerous risks including 

·   difficulties in assimilating acquired operations or products including the loss of key employees from or customers of acquired businesses

·   diversion of management’s attention from our core businesses

·   adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and

·   risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience

our failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate acquisitions on favorable terms 

a general economic downturn or sudden disruption in business conditions may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items which could adversely affect our financial results 

the general level of consumer spending is affected by a number of factors including general economic conditions inflation interest rates energy costs and consumer confidence generally all of which are beyond our control consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower and may impact sales of our products in addition sudden disruptions in business conditions for example as a consequence of events such as the outbreak of sars in 2003 or those that are currently taking place in the middle east or as a result of a terrorist attack retaliation and the threat of further attacks or retaliation or as a result of adverse weather conditions such as hurricane katrina can have a short and sometimes longterm impact on consumer spending 

events that impact consumers’ willingness or ability to travel andor purchase our products while traveling may impact our travel retail business which is a significant contributor to our overall results 

a downturn in the economies in which we sell our products or a sudden disruption of business conditions in those economies could adversely affect our sales 

changes in laws regulations and policies that affect our business could adversely affect our financial results 

our business is subject to numerous laws regulations and policies changes in the laws regulations and policies including the interpretation or enforcement thereof that affect or will affect our business including changes in accounting standards tax laws and regulations trade rules and customs regulations and the outcome and expense of legal or regulatory proceedings and any action we may take as a result could adversely affect our financial results 

our success depends in part on the quality and safety of our products 

our success depends in part on the quality and safety of our products if our products are found to be defective or unsafe or if they otherwise fail to meet our consumers’ standards our relationships with customers or consumers could suffer the appeal of one or more of our brands could be diminished and we could lose sales andor become subject to liability claims any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our success depends in part on our key personnel 

our success depends in part on our ability to retain our key personnel including our executive officers and senior management team the unexpected loss of one or more of our key employees could adversely affect our business our success also depends in part on our continuing ability to identify hire train and retain other highly qualified personnel competition for these employees can be intense we may not be able to attract assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business this risk may be exacerbated by uncertainties associated with our longterm strategy smi as defined below and other initiatives 

we are subject to risks related to our international operations 

we operate on a global basis with approximately 51 of our fiscal 2006 net sales generated outside the united states we maintain offices in over 35 countries and have key operational facilities located outside the united states that manufacture warehouse or distribute goods for sale throughout the world foreign operations are subject to many risks and uncertainties including but not limited to 

·   fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which can affect our results of operations the value of our foreign assets the relative prices at which we and foreign competitors sell products in the same markets and the cost of certain inventory and noninventory items required in our operations

·   changes in foreign laws regulations and policies including restrictions on trade import and export license requirements and tariffs and taxes as well as changes in united states laws and regulations relating to foreign trade and investment and

·   adverse weather conditions social and geopolitical conditions such as terrorist attacks war or other military action

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects results of operations and financial condition 

a disruption in operations could adversely affect our business and financial results 

as a company engaged in manufacturing and distribution on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including industrial accidents environmental events strikes and other labor disputes disruptions in logistics or information systems loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites product quality control safety licensing requirements and other regulatory issues as well as natural disasters and other external factors over which we have no control if such an event were to occur it could have an adverse affect on our business and financial results 

our information systems and websites may be susceptible to outages and other risks 

we have information systems that support our business processes including product development marketing sales order processing production distribution finance and intracompany communications throughout the world we have ecommerce and other internet websites in the united states and many other countries these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire floods power loss telecommunications failures breakins and similar events despite the implementation of network security measures our systems may be vulnerable to computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering the occurrence of these or other events could disrupt or damage our information systems and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we are subject to risks associated with implementing global information systems 

as part of a program that we call our “strategic modernization initiative” or “smi” we are implementing enterprisewide global programs intended to deliver a single set of integrated data processes and technologies which would be scalable and used to standardize business processes across brands operating units and sales affiliates the implementation of smi at our aveda operating unit is planned for fiscal 2007 the full implementation of smi is not expected until 2010 failure to implement smi as planned in terms of timing specifications andor costs could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

the price of our securities periodically may rise or fall based on the accuracy of analysts’ or others’ predictions of our earnings or other financial performance 

our business planning process is designed to maximize the longterm strength growth and profitability of the company not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter we believe that this longerterm focus is in the best interests of the company and our stockholders however we do recognize that it may be helpful to provide investors with guidance as to what we think will be our future net sales and earnings accordingly when we announced our yearend financial results for fiscal 2006 we provided guidance as to our expected net sales and earnings for the fiscal year ending june 30 2007 and the quarter ending september 30 2006 while we generally expect to provide updates to our guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter we assume no responsibility to update any of our forwardlooking statements at such times or otherwise 

in all of our public statements when we make or update a forwardlooking statement about our sales andor earnings expectations we accompany such statements directly or by reference to a public document with a list of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we expect such a list is included among other places in our earnings press release and in our periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission eg in our reports on form 10k and form 10q these and other factors make it more difficult for outside observers such as research analysts to predict what our earnings will be in any given fiscal quarter or year 

outside analysts like all investors have the right to make their own predictions as to what the company’s financial results will be in a given fiscal year or quarter or even in future years outside analysts however have access to no more material information about the company’s plans than any other public investor and the company does not endorse their predictions as to our future performance nor does the company assume any responsibility to correct the predictions of outside analysts or others when they differ from the company’s own internal expectations when the company announces actual results that differ from those that outside analysts or others have been predicting the market price of the company’s securities could be affected investors who rely on the predictions of outside analysts or others when making investment decisions with respect to the company’s securities do so at their own risk the company takes no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in the prices of the company’s securities

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are involved from time to time in litigation and other legal proceedings incidental to our business management believes that the outcome of current litigation and legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial condition however management’s assessment of our current litigation and other legal proceedings could change in light of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions or other proceedings pending against us not presently known to us or determinations by judges juries or other finders of fact which are not in accord with management’s evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such litigation or proceedings 

on march 30 2005 the united states district court for the northern district of california entered into a final judgment approving the settlement agreement we entered into in july 2003 with the plaintiffs the other manufacturer defendants as defined below and the department store defendants as defined below in a consolidated class action lawsuit that had been pending in the superior court of the state of california in marin county since 1998 on april 29 2005 notices of appeal were filed by representatives of two members of the purported class of consumers one of those appeals has since been withdrawn if the appeal is resolved satisfactorily the final judgment will result in the plaintiffs’ claims being dismissed with prejudice in their entirety in both the federal and california actions there has been no finding or admission of any wrongdoing by us in this lawsuit we entered into the settlement agreement solely to avoid protracted and costly litigation in connection with the settlement agreement the defendants including the company will provide consumers with certain free products and pay the plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees to meet its obligations under the settlement we took a special pretax charge of 220 million or 135 million aftertax equal to 06 per diluted common share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 at june 30 2006 the remaining accrual balance was 163 million the charge did not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition in the federal action the plaintiffs purporting to represent a class of all us residents who purchased prestige cosmetics products at retail for personal use from eight department stores groups that sold such products in the united states the “department store defendants” alleged that the department store defendants the company and eight other manufacturers of cosmetics the “manufacturer defendants” conspired to fix and maintain retail prices and to limit the supply of prestige cosmetics products sold by the department store defendants in violation of state and federal laws the plaintiffs sought among other things treble damages equitable relief attorneys’ fees interest and costs 

in 1998 the office of the attorney general of the state of new york the “state” notified the company and ten other entities that they had been identified as potentially responsible parties “prps” with respect to the blydenburgh landfill in islip new york each prp may be jointly and severally liable for the costs of investigation and cleanup which the state estimated in 2006 to be approximately 197 million for all prps in 2001 the state sued other prps including hickey’s carting inc dennis c hickey and maria hickey collectively the “hickey parties” in the us district court for the eastern district of new york to recover such costs in connection with the site and in september 2002 the hickey parties brought contribution actions against the company and other blydenburgh prps these contribution actions seek to recover among other things any damages for which the hickey parties are found liable in the state’s lawsuit against them and related costs and expenses including attorneys’ fees in june 2004 the state added the company and other prps as defendants in its pending case against the hickey parties in april 2006 the company and other defendants added numerous other parties to the case as thirdparty defendants the company and certain other prps have engaged in settlement discussions which to date have been unsuccessful settlement negotiations with the new thirdparty defendants the state the company and other defendants began in july 2006 we have accrued an amount which we believe would be necessary to resolve our share of this matter if settlement discussions are not successful we intend to vigorously defend the pending claims while no assurance can be given as to the ultimate outcome management believes that the resolution of the blydenburgh matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition 

on june 13 2006 the superior court of california for the county of san diego dismissed without leave to amend all of the plaintiff’s final remaining claims against the company in a matter originally brought in december 2004 by the plaintiff purporting to represent a nationwide class of individuals “who have purchased skin care products from defendants that have been falsely advertised to have an ‘antiaging’ or youth inducing benefit or effect” the plaintiff sought injunctive relief restitution and general special and punitive damages for alleged violations of the california unfair competition law the california false advertising law and for negligent and intentional misrepresentation 

in june 2006 and october 2005 we received favorable decisions from the portuguese tax administration on the oppositions our subsidiary filed in july 2005 to the notices of assessment it received in may 2005 and on the opposition our subsidiary filed in march 2005 to the notice of assessment it received in december 2004 respectively furthermore the notification we received in june 2006 contained an order canceling the assessments received in may 2005 which were for the calendar years ended december 31 2001 and 2002 in the amounts of 216 million euro and 224 million euro respectively and the assessment received in december 2004 which was for the calendar year ended december 31 2000 in the amount of 260 million euro management believes that the decisions are not subject to appeal since 1989 our subsidiary has been operating in the madeira free trade zone located in portugal under license from the madeira development corporation 

on march 30 2006 a purported securities class action complaint captioned thomas s shin et al v the estée lauder companies inc et al was filed against the company and certain of our officers and directors collectively the “defendants” in the united states district court for the southern district of new york the complaint alleged that the defendants made statements during the period april 28 2005 to october 25 2005 in press releases the company’s public filings and during conference calls with analysts that were materially false and misleading and that artificially inflated the price of the company’s stock the complaint alleged claims under sections 10b and 20a of the securities exchange act of 1934 the complaint also asserted that during the class period certain executive officers and the trust for the benefit of a director sold shares of our class a common stock at artificially inflated prices three additional purported securities class action complaints were subsequently filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york containing similar allegations on july 10 2006 the court consolidated these actions under the caption in re estée lauder companies securities litigation appointed lead plaintiff and approved the selection of lead counsel a consolidated amended complaint is expected to be filed on or before september 8 2006 the defendants believe that the claims asserted in the original complaints which are likely to form the basis of the consolidated amended complaint are without merit and they intend to defend the consolidated action vigorously 

on april 10 2006 a shareholder derivative action complaint captioned miriam loveman v leonard a lauder et al was filed against certain of our officers and all of our directors as of that date collectively the “derivative action defendants” in the united states district court for the southern district of new york the complaint alleges that the derivative action defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the company based on the same alleged course of conduct identified in the shin complaint described above on may 4 2006 the derivative action was reassigned to the judge assigned to the now consolidated securities action the derivative action defendants similarly believe that this complaint is without merit and they intend to defend the action vigorously

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition at june 30 2006 and our results of operations for the three fiscal years ended june 30 2006 are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements these judgments can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition concentration of credit risk inventory pension and other postretirement benefit costs goodwill and other intangible assets income taxes derivatives and stockbased compensation 

management of the company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of the company’s board of directors 

revenue recognition revenues from merchandise sales are recognized upon transfer of ownership including passage of title to the customer and transfer of the risk of loss related to those goods in the americas region sales are generally recognized at the time the product is shipped to the customer and in the europe middle east  africa and asiapacific regions sales are generally recognized based upon the customer’s receipt in certain circumstances transfer of title takes place at the point of sale eg at our retail stores

sales are reported on a net sales basis which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual product returns received discounts incentive arrangements with retailers and an amount established for anticipated product returns our practice is to accept product returns from retailers only if properly requested authorized and approved in accepting returns we typically provide a credit to the retailer against accounts receivable from that retailer as a percentage of gross sales returns were 50 in fiscal 2006 and 46 in fiscal 2005 and 2004 

our sales return accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net sales this accrual is calculated based on a history of actual returns estimated future returns and information provided by authorized retailers regarding their inventory levels consideration of these factors results in an accrual for anticipated sales returns that reflects increases or decreases related to seasonal fluctuations experience has shown a relationship between retailer inventory levels and sales returns in the subsequent period as well as a consistent pattern of returns due to the seasonal nature of our business in addition as necessary specific accruals may be established for significant future known or anticipated events the types of known or anticipated events that we have considered and will continue to consider include but are not limited to the solvency of our customers store closings by retailers changes in the retail environment and our decision to continue or support new and existing products 

concentration of credit risk an entity is vulnerable to concentration of credit risk if it is exposed to risks of loss greater than it would have had it mitigated its risks through diversification of customers the significance of such credit risk depends on the extent and nature of the concentration

during fiscal 2006 federated department stores inc acquired the may department stores company resulting in the merger of our previous two largest customers this customer sells products primarily within north america and accounted for 10058 million or 16 of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2006 and 1054 million or 14 of our accounts receivable at june 30 2006 although management believes that this customer and our other major customers are sound and creditworthy a severe adverse impact on their business operations could have a corresponding material adverse effect on our net sales cash flows andor financial condition 

in the ordinary course of business we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions in the amount of 271 million and 289 million as of june 30 2006 and 2005 respectively our allowance for doubtful accounts is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net earnings the allowance for doubtful accounts was reduced by 120 million 126 million and 256 million for customer deductions and writeoffs in fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively and increased by 102 million 114 million and 239 million for additional provisions in fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively this reserve is based upon the evaluation of accounts receivable aging specific exposures and historical trends 

inventory we state our inventory at the lower of cost or fair market value with cost being determined on the firstin firstout fifo method we believe fifo most closely matches the flow of our products from manufacture through sale the reported net value of our inventory includes saleable products promotional products raw materials and componentry and work in process that will be sold or used in future periods inventory cost includes raw materials direct labor and overhead

  

we also record an inventory obsolescence reserve which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value based on various product sales projections this reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales in addition and as necessary we may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events 

pension and other postretirement benefit costs we offer the following benefits to some or all of our employees a domestic trustbased noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan “us qualified plan” and an unfunded nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations collectively with the us qualified plan the “domestic plans” a contributory defined contribution plan international pension plans which vary by country consisting of both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans deferred compensation and certain other postretirement benefits

the amounts necessary to fund future payouts under these plans are subject to numerous assumptions and variables certain significant variables require us to make assumptions that are within our control such as an anticipated discount rate expected rate of return on plan assets and future compensation levels we evaluate these assumptions with our actuarial advisors and we believe they are within accepted industry ranges although an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a direct impact on reported net earnings 

the preretirement discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated longterm bonds for fiscal 2006 we used a preretirement discount rate for our domestic plans of 525 and varying rates on our international plans of between 175 and 550 the preretirement rate for our domestic plans is based on a bond portfolio that includes only longterm bonds with an aa rating or equivalent from a major rating agency we believe the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio is expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of our domestic plans for fiscal 2006 we used an expected return on plan assets of 775 for our us qualified plan and varying rates of between 275 and 750 for our international plans in determining the longterm rate of return for a plan we consider the historical rates of return the nature of the plan’s investments and an expectation for the plan’s investment strategies the us qualified plan asset allocation as of june 30 2006 was approximately 62 equity investments 27 fixed income investments and 11 other investments the asset allocation of our combined international plans as of june 30 2006 was approximately 58 equity investments 23 fixed income investments and 19 other investments the difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets is accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore affects our recorded obligations and recognized expenses in such future periods for fiscal 2006 our pension plans had actual returns on assets of 644 million as compared with expected returns on assets of 370 million which resulted in a net deferred gain of 274 million 

a 25 basispoint change in the discount rate or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have had the following effect on fiscal 2006 pension expense 

   

our postretirement plans are comprised of health care plans that could be impacted by health care cost trend rates which may have a significant effect on the amounts reported a onepercentagepoint change in assumed health care cost trend rates for fiscal 2006 would have had the following effects 

   

for fiscal 2007 we will use a preretirement discount rate for the domestic plans of 625 and varying rates for our international plans of between 225 and 575 we anticipate using an expected return on plan assets of 775 for the us qualified plan and varying rates for our international pension plans of between 275 and 725 the net change in these assumptions from those used in fiscal 2006 will cause approximately a 15 million decrease in pension expense in fiscal 2007 we will continue to monitor the market conditions relative to these assumptions and adjust them accordingly 

goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets other intangible assets principally consist of purchased royalty rights and trademarks goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite life are not amortized

  

on an annual basis or sooner if certain events or circumstances warrant we test goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment to determine the fair value of these intangible assets there are many assumptions and estimates used that directly impact the results of the testing we have the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose to mitigate undue influence we use industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management 

income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 109 “accounting for income taxes” this statement establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effects of income taxes that result from an enterprise’s activities during the current and preceding years it requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes

as of june 30 2006 we have current net deferred tax assets of 1391 million and noncurrent net deferred tax liabilities of 432 million the net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization as well as the continued application of currently anticipated tax rates included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance of approximately 65 million for deferred tax assets which relates to foreign tax loss carryforwards not utilized to date where management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the relevant jurisdiction based on our assessments no additional valuation allowance is required if we determine that a deferred tax asset will not be realizable an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will result in a reduction of earnings at that time 

we provide tax reserves for federal state local and international exposures relating to periods subject to audit the development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues potential outcomes and timing and is a subjective critical estimate although the outcome relating to these exposures is uncertain in management’s opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating from these exposures in certain circumstances the ultimate outcome of exposures and risks involves significant uncertainties which render them inestimable if actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates including those that cannot be quantified they could have a material impact on our results of operations as we experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 see “results of operations  fiscal 2006 as compared with fiscal 2005 — provision for income taxes ” 

derivatives we account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” as amended which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities this statement also requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and that they be measured at fair value

we currently use derivative financial instruments to hedge certain anticipated transactions and interest rates as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies we do not utilize derivatives for trading or speculative purposes hedge effectiveness is documented assessed and monitored by employees who are qualified to make such assessments and monitor the instruments variables that are external to us such as social political and economic risks may have an impact on our hedging program and the results thereof for a discussion on the quantitative impact of market risks related to our derivative financial instruments refer to “ liquidity and capital resources — market risk” 

stockbased compensation with the adoption of sfas no 123r on july 1 2005 we are required to record the fair value of stockbased compensation awards as an expense in order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant we apply the blackscholes optionpricing model inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stockprice volatility option life riskfree interest rate and dividend yield while the riskfree interest rate and dividend yield are less subjective assumptions that are based on factual data derived from public sources the expected stockprice volatility and option life assumptions require a greater level of judgment which makes them critical accounting estimates

we use an expected stockprice volatility assumption that is a combination of both current and historical implied volatilities of the underlying stock which are obtained from public data sources this approach is used as a predictor of future realized and implied volatilities and is directly related to stock option valuation for stock option grants issued during the fiscal year ended june 30 2006 we used a weightedaverage expected stockprice volatility of 23 based upon the implied volatility at the time of issuance 

with regard to the weightedaverage option life assumption we consider the exercise behavior of past grants and model the pattern of aggregate exercises patterns are determined based on specific criteria of the aggregate pool of optionees including the reaction to vesting realizable value longrun exercise propensity pentup demand stock runup effect and shorttimetomaturity effect for stock option grants issued during the fiscal year ended june 30 2006 we used a weightedaverage expected option life assumption of approximately 8 years 

  

while we believe the above critical estimates are based on outcomes that are reasonably likely to occur if we were to increase or decrease the expected option life by 1 year and simultaneously increase or decrease the expected volatility by 100 basis points recognized compensation expense would have changed approximately 26 million in either direction for the fiscal year ended june 30 2006 

quantitative analysis during the threeyear period ended june 30 2006 there have not been material changes in the assumptions underlying these critical accounting policies nor to the related significant estimates with the exception of our tax settlement with the internal revenue service in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 which finalized the ultimate liability for exposures which were previously inestimable see “results of operations  fiscal 2006 as compared with fiscal 2005 — provision for income taxes ” the results of our business underlying these assumptions have not differed significantly from our expectations

while we believe that the estimates that we have made are proper and the related results of operations for the period are presented fairly in all material respects other assumptions could reasonably be justified that would change the amount of reported net sales cost of sales operating expenses or our provision for income taxes as they relate to the provisions for anticipated sales returns allowance for doubtful accounts inventory obsolescence reserve and income taxes for fiscal 2006 had these estimates been changed simultaneously by 25 in either direction our reported gross profit would have increased or decreased by approximately 46 million operating expenses would have changed by approximately 07 million and the provision for income taxes would have increased or decreased by approximately 10 million the collective impact of these changes on operating income net earnings and net earnings per diluted common share would be an increase or decrease of approximately 53 million 63 million and 03 respectively 

results of operations 

overview 

we manufacture market and sell skin care makeup fragrance and hair care products which are distributed in over 130 countries and territories we believe that the best way to increase stockholder value is to provide our customers and consumers with the products and services that they have come to expect from us in the most efficient and profitable manner with this goal in mind we have developed a longterm strategy based on the following five imperatives 

1   optimize brand portfolio

2   strengthen product categories

3   strengthen and expand geographic presence

4   diversify and strengthen distribution channels

5   achieve operational and cost excellence

in fiscal 2006 our achievements included excellent growth in sales and profits in our makeup artist brands the divestiture of stila the strengthening of estée lauder pleasures  and the introduction of new products such as missoni fragrances and unforgivable these makeup and fragrance efforts together with successful niche skin care and hair care products have further strengthened our product categories 

around the globe we generated growth in sales and profits in our travel retail business and increased our presence in china and india in alternative channels we continued to grow our online business achieved doubledigit profitability in our m·a·c stores and improved our performance at our aveda stores shortterm improvements in operational and organizational effectiveness led to improved customer service levels and better alignment of financial and inventory objectives and strategic costcutting we also managed to cut costs through our voluntary separation program and the related reorganization of certain operations at the same time we continued to make progress on our strategic modernization initiative pursuant to which we are planning to standardize business processes across our brands operating units and sales affiliates and implement enterprisewide sap information systems that will provide us with integrated data processes and technologies 

during fiscal 2006 we also faced challenges many of which we expect to be ongoing in fiscal 2007 for instance we continue to see challenges for certain of our core brands due in part to the consolidation and changes taking place among retailers and the decline in effectiveness of giftwithpurchase promotions in addition the fragrance business model continues to be a challenge with even the most successful launches having difficulty becoming profitable efforts to expand geographically are complicated by increasing regulatory issues and cultural barriers despite our efforts to diversify our distribution there was no significant change in the mix of sales in the various channels continued increases in energy and raw material costs as well as inventory obsolescence are continuing to pressure cost of goods 

as we continue to implement our strategic imperatives we expect to make selective investments embark on new business endeavors and pursue initiatives that we believe will have longterm benefits the timing impact and magnitude of any particular actions such as an acquisition to strengthen our product categories andor diversify our distribution channels are subject to numerous factors and cannot be predicted nevertheless we expect that any such actions will impact our financial condition andor results of operations in one or more future quarterly and annual periods 

  

the following table is a comparative summary of operating results from continuing operations for fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 and reflects the basis of presentation described in note 2 and note 17 to the notes to consolidated financial statements for all periods presented products and services that do not meet our definition of skin care makeup fragrance and hair care have been included in the “other” category 

  

 

 refer to the following discussion in “fiscal 2006 as compared with fiscal 2005 — operating expenses” for further information regarding these charges 

  

the following table presents certain consolidated earnings data as a percentage of net sales 

   

in order to meet the demands of consumers we continually introduce new products support new and established products through advertising sampling and merchandising and phase out existing products that no longer meet the needs of our consumers the economics of developing producing launching and supporting products influence our sales and operating performance each period the introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products which we take into account in our business planning 

fiscal 2006 as compared with fiscal 2005 

net sales net sales increased 3 or 1838 million to 64638 million due to growth in our makeup skin care and hair care product categories which was partially offset by lower sales in our fragrance product category the net increase reflects sales growth in all geographic regions excluding the impact of foreign currency translation net sales increased 4 

product categories skin care 

net sales of skin care products increased 2 or 487 million to 24008 million primarily due to new product launches the recent launches of resilience lift extreme ultra firming cremes and renutriv ultimate lifting serum by estée lauder and turnaround concentrate visible skin renewer and turnaround 15minute facial by clinique generated incremental sales of approximately 123 million combined perfectionist cp by estée lauder and products in clinique’s 3step skin care system bolstered by the introduction of liquid facial soap contributed approximately 78 million to the increase these improvements were offset by approximately 157 million of decreases in sales of existing products in certain of our core brands as well as declines in our beautybank brands which completed their initial rollout during the prior year excluding the impact of foreign currency translation skin care net sales increased 3 

makeup 

makeup net sales increased 6 or 1374 million to 25042 million reflecting growth from our makeup artist brands of approximately 179 million this growth was partially offset by approximately 72 million of lower sales from certain existing products reflecting challenges experienced by certain of our core brands and declines in our beautybank brands which completed their initial rollout during the prior year excluding the impact of foreign currency translation makeup net sales increased 7 

  

fragrance 

net sales of fragrance products decreased 4 or 473 million to 12133 million as we continue to be challenged in this product category particularly in the americas region estée lauder beyond paradise and various fragrances from clinique and tommy hilfiger generated approximately 106 million of lower sales also contributing to the decrease were lower sales of approximately 28 million of true star by tommy hilfiger and lauder beyond paradise men by estée lauder as we anniversary the initial shipments of those products in the prior year these decreases were partially offset by the recent launches of true star men by tommy hilfiger and unforgivable by sean john which collectively contributed approximately 49 million to the category and higher sales of approximately 47 million of dkny be delicious and estée lauder pleasures  excluding the impact of foreign currency translation fragrance net sales decreased 2

hair care 

hair care net sales increased 16 or 448 million to 3187 million primarily due to sales growth from bumble and bumble and aveda products bumble and bumble sales benefited from sales growth due to new points of distribution increases in sales of core products and the launches of shine and powder products aveda net sales increases benefited from the recent launch of damage remedy hair care products strong demand for color products and from the recent acquisition of a distributor excluding the impact of foreign currency translation hair care net sales increased 17 

geographic regions 

net sales in the americas increased 3 or 953 million to 34464 million the increase was led by growth in the united states of approximately 190 million from our makeup artist and hair care brands our internet distribution and the introduction of the unforgivable fragrance by sean john partially offsetting this growth was approximately 122 million related to weaknesses in certain of our core brands as a result of challenges from competitive pressures and business disruptions at certain key retailers and lower sales from our beautybank brands which completed their initial rollout during the prior year we expect business disruptions at certain key retailers in the united states to continue into fiscal 2007 net sales growth in canada latin america and mexico contributed an additional 48 million to the increase 

in europe the middle east  africa net sales increased 2 or 386 million to 21477 million reflecting higher net sales of approximately 64 million from our travel retail and distributor businesses russia and the united kingdom with all benefiting from the success of the dkny be delicious franchise and the sale of m ž a ž c products these increases were partially offset by decreases of approximately 26 million in spain and italy spain’s net sales were adversely affected by changes to our distribution policy and a difficult retail environment net sales in italy were negatively impacted by changes to our distribution policy and to a lesser extent the balancing of inventory levels at its retailers on a local currency basis net sales in europe the middle east  africa increased 5

recent events related to the suspected terrorist activities in the united kingdom and subsequent restrictions on products that can be carried inflight have created uncertainty in the outlook for our travel retail business in fiscal 2007 based on current information we do not believe these events will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for our fiscal 2007 first quarter or full year in fiscal 2006 our travel retail business comprised approximately 7 of total net sales and accounted for approximately 20 of operating income 

net sales in asiapacific increased 6 or 499 million to 8697 million strategic growth in china combined with positive results in korea and hong kong contributed approximately 57 million to sales growth in this region these increases were partially offset by decreases in japan and australia of approximately 18 million japan’s results were negatively impacted due to the strengthening of the us dollar against the japanese yen the decrease in australia reflected slower sellthrough in a difficult retail environment particularly in the fragrance category as well as the balancing of inventory levels at a major retailer on a local currency basis net sales in asiapacific increased 7 

we strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market which may account for differences in regional sales growth 

cost of sales cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales increased to 261 as compared with 255 in the prior year this change reflected an increase in obsolescence charges of approximately 40 basis points the net change in the mix of our business within our geographic regions and product categories of approximately 20 basis points a charge related to unutilized tooling of approximately 10 basis points and 20 basis points related to commodity material prices partially offsetting these increases were favorable changes in promotional activities of approximately 30 basis points 

  

the higher price of oil has resulted in price increases in certain oilbased chemicals which has had a slight adverse effect on our cost of sales margin in an ongoing effort to mitigate the impact of these increases we are seeking potential offsetting opportunities in other categories of material purchases through our sourcing initiative in lowercost manufacturing locations worldwide 

since certain promotional activities are a component of net sales or cost of sales and the timing and level of promotions vary with our promotional calendar we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in the cost of sales percentage in addition future cost of sales mix may be impacted by the inclusion of new brands which have margin and product cost structures different from those of our existing brands 

operating expenses operating expenses increased to 643 of net sales as compared with 629 of net sales in the prior year the current year operating expense margin was negatively impacted by charges related to the implementation of our cost savings initiative of approximately 921 million or approximately 140 basis points costs related to stockbased compensation as a result of the adoption of sfas no 123r of approximately 60 basis points and the estimated impact of both the merger of federated department stores inc and the may department stores company and the hurricanes that affected the southern united states of approximately 40 basis points partially offsetting these incremental costs were operating expense margin improvements of approximately 90 basis points primarily resulting from net sales growth in brands and channels with lower advertising merchandising and sampling cost structures as well as an overall reduction in this type of spending overall operating expenses reflected savings achieved during fiscal 2006 from our cost savings initiative 

changes in advertising sampling and merchandising spending result from the type timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts as well as the markets being emphasized 

during fiscal 2006 we recorded special charges associated with a cost savings initiative that was designed to support our longterm financial objectives as part of this multifaceted initiative we identified savings opportunities that include streamlined processes and organizational changes the principal component of the initiative was a voluntary separation program offered primarily to north americabased employees during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 involuntary separations were communicated to certain employees under this initiative we incurred expenses related to onetime termination benefits for 494 employees of which 28 were involuntary which benefits were based principally upon years of service 

in addition we identified other cost savings opportunities to improve efficiencies in our distribution network and product offerings and to eliminate other nonessential costs these charges primarily related to employee severance for facilities that are closing contract cancellations counter and door closings and product returns an additional 2 million to 3 million is expected to be incurred in fiscal 2007 related to the cost savings initiative 

for the year ended june 30 2006 aggregate expenses of 921 million were recorded as special charges related to the cost savings initiative in the accompanying consolidated statement of earnings at june 30 2006 407 million and 282 million related to the cost savings initiative were recorded in other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities respectively in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 

the following table summarizes the costs and expected savings associated with our cost savings initiative which impacted and will continue to impact our operating expenses and cost of sales 

   29 

  operating results operating income decreased 15 or 1072 million to 6196 million operating margin was 96 of net sales in fiscal 2006 as compared with 116 in the prior year these results were negatively impacted by the effects of special charges related to our cost savings initiative of 921 million or 14 of net sales in addition to the special charges net sales growth was more than offset by the increases in our cost of sales and operating expense margins as previously discussed 

the following discussions of operating results by product categories and geographic regions exclude the impact of special charges related to the implementation of our cost savings initiative we believe the following analysis of operating results better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business

product categories 

operating income declined 79 or 281 million to 77 million in the fragrance product category reflecting lower sales and to a lesser extent expenses incurred related to development of new products and brands partially offset by a shift in spending in certain of our core brands to other product categories as we continue to support selected fragrances and develop new products we anticipate the fragrance category to remain challenging during fiscal 2007 skin care operating income decreased 5 or 194 million to 3464 million primarily reflecting lower than anticipated net sales in certain of our core brands operating income increased 9 or 283 million to 3294 million in the makeup product category primarily reflecting sales growth from our makeup artist brands partially offset by declines in certain of our core brands hair care operating income increased 16 or 37 million to 265 million reflecting worldwide sales growth in fiscal 2006 the merger of federated department stores inc and the may department stores company had a negative impact on the operating results of our skin care makeup and fragrance product categories while incremental operating expenses associated with new accounting rules for stockbased compensation negatively impacted all of our product categories 

geographic regions 

operating income in the americas decreased 6 or 221 million to 3441 million primarily reflecting challenges experienced by certain of our core brands due in part to competitive pressures and retailer consolidations and incremental operating expenses of approximately 33 million associated with new accounting rules for stockbased compensation the ongoing success of our makeup artist and hair care brands and our internet distribution partially offset these challenges we expect business disruptions to continue into fiscal 2007 at certain key retailers in the united states 

in europe the middle east  africa operating income decreased 3 or 78 million to 2975 million this decrease was primarily due to lower results in spain benelux belgium the netherlands and luxembourg and italy of approximately 20 million collectively these decreases were partially offset by improvements of approximately 12 million in france our travel retail business and central europe hungary poland and czech republic 

in asiapacific operating income increased 27 or 148 million to 701 million this increase reflects improved results of approximately 16 million in korea japan and china partially offset by lower results in taiwan and thailand of approximately 4 million collectively as china is an emerging market for us we have invested and plan to continue to invest in new brand expansion and business opportunities there 

interest expense net net interest expense was 238 million as compared with 139 million in the prior year the increase in net interest expense was primarily due to higher average interest rates and to a lesser extent higher average debt balances due to outstanding commercial paper during the year the increased expense was partially offset by increased interest income related to higher investment interest rates 

provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes represents federal foreign state and local income taxes the effective rate for income taxes for fiscal 2006 was 436 as compared with 412 in the prior year the effective rate differs from statutory rates due to the effect of state and local taxes tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and certain nondeductible expenses the company’s effective tax rate will change from year to year based on nonrecurring and recurring factors including but not limited to the geographic mix of earnings the timing and amount of foreign dividends enacted tax legislation state and local taxes tax audit findings and settlements and the interaction of various global tax strategies 

  

on july 13 2006 we announced a settlement with the internal revenue service “irs” regarding its examination of our consolidated federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended june 30 1998 through june 30 2001 the settlement resolves previously disclosed issues raised during the irs’s examination including transfer pricing and foreign tax credit computations the settlement of these issues resulted in a tax charge of approximately 46 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and represents the aggregate earnings impact of the settlement through fiscal 2006 in addition during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 we completed the repatriation of foreign earnings through intercompany dividends as required under the provisions of the american jobs creation act of 2004 the “ajca” in connection with the repatriation we finalized computations of the related aggregate tax impact resulting in a favorable adjustment of approximately 11 million the tax settlement coupled with the ajca favorable tax adjustment resulted in a net increase to our fiscal 2006 income tax provision of approximately 35 million 

the increase in the effective income tax rate was attributable to the tax settlement charge of approximately 770 basis points an increase of approximately 60 basis points resulting from our foreign operations and an increase in nondeductible expenses of approximately 30 basis points these increases were partially offset by the net reduction in the incremental tax charge relative to the repatriation of foreign earnings pursuant to the ajca of approximately 570 basis points as well as a reduction of approximately 50 basis points for miscellaneous items 

discontinued operations on april 10 2006 the “effective date” we completed the sale of certain assets and operations of the reporting unit that marketed and sold stila brand products to stila corp the “purchaser” an affiliate of sun capital partners inc for consideration of 230 million the sale price included cash of 93 million a promissory note with a notional value of 133 million and a fair value of 110 million and convertible preferred stock with an aggregate liquidation preference of 50 million and a fair value of 27 million as additional consideration for the purchased assets and subject to the terms and conditions of the sale agreement the purchaser will pay us an amount equal to two percent of the annual net sales of the acquired business during the period commencing on the effective date and ending august 20 2019 we will use these proceeds to satisfy our commitment under the 1999 agreement pursuant to which we originally purchased the stila business the purchaser immediately assumed responsibility for all decisions regarding the operations of the stila business and we agreed to divest ourself of continuing involvement in the stila business except as described below 

in fiscal 2006 we recorded charges of 803 million net of 433 million tax benefit to discontinued operations which reflected the loss on the disposition of the business of 699 million net of tax and adjustments to the fair value of assets sold the costs to dispose of those assets not acquired by the purchaser and other costs in connection with the sale the charges also include the operating losses of 104 million net of tax for the fiscal year ended june 30 2006 net sales associated with the discontinued operations were 451 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2006 all statements of earnings information for the prior years has been restated for comparative purposes including the restatement of the makeup product category and each of the geographic regions presented in note 17  segment data and related information 

in order to facilitate the transition of the stila business to the purchaser we agreed to provide certain information systems accounting and other back office services to the purchaser in exchange for monthly service fees designed to recover the estimated costs of providing these transition services we also agreed with the purchaser to provide certain distribution and online services in both cases the services are expected to conclude in fiscal 2007 in addition we agreed to manufacture and sell to the purchaser a limited range of products for a period of up to four months following the effective date and in the case of one product of up to two years

product categories 

skin care 

net sales of skin care products increased 10 or 2120 million to 23521 million approximately 179 million of this sales increase was related to the introduction of future perfect antiwrinkle radiance creme spf 15 and launches in the perfectionist and renutriv product lines by estée lauder launches of superdefense triple action moisturizers spf 25 and certain repairwear products by clinique the introduction of certain american beauty and good skin™ products and the recent launch of modern friction by origins on a combined basis strong sales of products in clinique’s 3step skin care system and the lifting face serum  the lifting intensifier by la mer contributed approximately 29 million to the sales increase partially offsetting these increases was a decrease of approximately 52 million in sales of perfectionist correcting serum for lineswrinkles idealist microd deep thermal refinisher and the white light and lightsource lines of products by estée lauder excluding the impact of foreign currency translation skin care net sales increased 7 

makeup 

makeup net sales increased 13 or 2674 million to 23668 million the growth included approximately 56 million of net sales from the launches of american beauty and flirt and higher sales of bobbi brown products collectively an increase of approximately 105 million was attributable to the recent launches of superbalanced compact makeup spf 20 and colour surge eye shadow from clinique and lash xl maximum length mascara tender blush pure pops brushon color and aeromatte ultralucent pressed powder by estée lauder also contributing to sales growth was approximately 70 million of increased sales from m·a·c’s small eye shadow studio fix lustreglass and pro longwear lipcolour partially offsetting these increases was a decrease of approximately 38 million in sales of the high impact mascara and high impact eye shadow collections and the glosswear line of products by clinique as well as of pure color lip vinyl by estée lauder excluding the impact of foreign currency translation makeup net sales increased 11 

fragrance 

net sales of fragrance products increased 3 or 395 million to 12606 million the increase was due to approximately 188 million in sales generated by the fiscal 2005 launches of dkny be delicious and dkny be delicious men true star from tommy hilfiger lauder beyond paradise men from estée lauder happy to be from clinique and donald trump the fragrance partially offsetting the new product sales were decreases in sales of approximately 92 million of estée lauder beyond paradise aramis life and clinique simply which were launched in the prior year as well as decreases in sales of approximately 49 million of tommy jeans and tommy from tommy hilfiger certain other aramis products and lauder intuition men from estée lauder excluding the impact of foreign currency translation fragrance net sales increased slightly the fragrance category remained challenging in fiscal 2006 

hair care 

hair care net sales increased 10 to 2739 million this increase amounting to 245 million was due to sales growth from aveda and bumble and bumble products aveda net sales increased as a result of sales of new professional color products and the introductions of pure abundance and damage remedy hair care products while bumble and bumble benefited from recent launches in its hair and scalp treatment line of products and the initial shipments of crème de coco shampoos and conditioners both of these brands also benefited from new points of distribution excluding the impact of foreign currency translation hair care net sales increased 9 

geographic regions 

net sales in the americas increased 7 or 2303 million to 33511 million this region experienced growth in all major categories which was fueled by the diversification in our product offerings as new products and brands mitigated challenges among certain core brands and successful fiscal 2004 launches in the united states our makeup artist and hair care brands along with products from our aramis and designer fragrances division contributed approximately 145 million to the increase in addition higher net sales in canada and the inclusion of beautybank products contributed approximately 76 million collectively 

in europe the middle east  africa net sales increased 13 or 2457 million to 21091 million primarily due to higher net sales in the united kingdom our travel retail business spain portugal south africa and greece of approximately 179 million collectively the increase in net sales included benefits from the effect of the weaker us dollar as compared to various european currencies excluding the impact of foreign currency translation net sales in europe the middle east  africa increased 7

we strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market which may account for differences in regional sales growth 

  

  

cost of sales cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales was 255 and remained unchanged compared with fiscal 2004 favorable net changes in production and supply chain efforts of approximately 30 basis points primarily driven by favorable material sourcing were offset by the net change in the mix of our business within our geographic regions and product categories as discussed above which includes the impact of the beautybank brands changes in exchange rates compared with the prior year had a de minimis net impact on our cost of sales margin 

since certain promotional activities are a component of net sales or cost of sales and the timing and level of promotions vary with our promotional calendar we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in the cost of sales percentage in addition future cost of sales mix may be impacted by the inclusion of new brands which have margin and product cost structures different from those of our existing brands 

operating expenses operating expenses as a percentage of net sales improved to 629 from 632 in fiscal 2004 our planned increase in advertising merchandising and sampling over the prior year of approximately 50 basis points was offset in full by our ongoing cost containment efforts to maintain expenses in line with our business needs we also realized a benefit of approximately 30 basis points from the elimination of royalty payments previously made to mrs estée lauder 

changes in advertising sampling and merchandising spending result from the type timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts as well as the markets being emphasized 

operating results based on the growth of net sales our constant cost of sales margin and the improvement in our operating expense margin as previously discussed operating income increased 12 or 779 million to 7268 million as compared with the prior fiscal year operating margins were 116 of net sales in fiscal 2005 as compared with 113 in fiscal 2004 

product categories 

operating income increased 15 or 385 million in makeup and 9 or 295 million in skin care reflecting overall sales growth and sales of recently launched products operating results also increased 44 or 110 million in fragrance reflecting sales growth from new and recently launched products while we experienced improved results in fiscal 2005 due to these new launches the fragrance business continues to be challenging hair care operating results decreased 3 or 08 million reflecting an increase in operating expenses related to the growth of our business in the united states as well as the opening of new points of distribution in korea and japan partially offset by increases in net sales as previously discussed hair care results were also adversely impacted in fiscal 2005 by the need to make alternative arrangements due to the bankruptcy of a thirdparty supplier the situation was rectified during fiscal 2005 

geographic regions 

operating income in the americas increased 13 or 430 million to 3662 million primarily due to higher net sales resulting from an overall improvement in the retail environment strong product launches and growth from our newer brands 

in europe the middle east  africa operating income increased 10 or 284 million to 3053 million primarily due to improved results from our travel retail business spain the united kingdom and switzerland of approximately 33 million collectively partially offsetting this improvement were lower results in france which was negatively impacted by the consolidation of major retailers and in russia where we converted our business from a distributor to a direct subsidiary of approximately 6 million on a combined basis 

in asiapacific operating income increased 13 or 65 million to 553 million this increase reflected improved results in hong kong taiwan thailand and japan of approximately 10 million collectively partially offset by a decrease in operating income in korea and china of approximately 6 million combined in addition the asiapacific region did not realize the benefits of spending behind new whitening products which experienced a delay in launching during fiscal 2005 

interest expense net net interest expense was 139 million as compared with 271 million in fiscal 2004 the decrease in net interest expense was due primarily to a 165 million decrease in preferred stock dividends as a result of the redemption of 2916 million aggregate principal amount of the 2015 preferred stock on june 10 2004 and the reduction in the dividend rate on the remaining 684 million of the 2015 preferred stock this improvement was partially offset by an increase in interest expense as a result of higher debt balances and to a lesser extent higher interest rates 

  

  

provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes represents federal foreign state and local income taxes the effective rate for income taxes for fiscal 2005 was 412 as compared with 377 in fiscal 2004 the effective rate differs from statutory rates due to the effect of state and local taxes tax rates in foreign jurisdictions the effect of repatriating foreign earnings and certain nondeductible expenses 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 we formulated a plan to repatriate approximately 690 million of foreign earnings in fiscal 2006 which included 500 million of extraordinary intercompany dividends under the provisions of the ajca this action resulted in an aggregate tax charge of approximately 35 million in fiscal 2005 which included an incremental tax charge of approximately 28 million 

the increase in the effective income tax rate was attributable to the incremental tax charge resulting from the repatriation plan of approximately 390 basis points and an increase of approximately 110 basis points resulting from our foreign operations these increases were partially offset by a reduction in the amount of nondeductible preferred stock dividends of approximately 90 basis points a decrease in state and local income taxes of approximately 40 basis points and an increase in tax credits of approximately 20 basis points 

net earnings net earnings and diluted net earnings per common share increased approximately 19 and 20 respectively net earnings as compared with fiscal 2004 improved 640 million to 4061 million and diluted net earnings per common share improved to 178 from 148 net earnings from continuing operations increased by 314 million or 8 and diluted net earnings per common share from continuing operations increased 10 to 180 from 164 in the prior fiscal year the planned repatriation of foreign earnings in accordance with the ajca as discussed above resulted in an incremental tax charge of approximately 28 million or 12 per diluted common share 

financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations and borrowings under commercial paper borrowings from the issuance of longterm debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks and other lenders in the united states and abroad at june 30 2006 we had cash and cash equivalents of 3686 million compared with 5533 million at june 30 2005 

at june 30 2006 our outstanding borrowings of 5215 million included i 2300 million of 6 senior notes due january 2012 consisting of 2500 million principal unamortized debt discount of 06 million and a 194 million adjustment to reflect the fair value of an outstanding interest rate swap ii 1974 million of 575 senior notes due october 2033 consisting of 2000 million principal and unamortized debt discount of 26 million iii a 18 million euro note approximately 19 million at the exchange rate at june 30 2006 payable semiannually through february 2008 at a variable interest rate iv 71 million of capital lease obligations v a 30 billion yen shortterm borrowing under a revolving credit facility approximately 262 million at the exchange rate at june 30 2006 vi 380 million of outstanding loan participation notes due july 2006 at an initial interest rate of 541 and vii 209 million of other shortterm borrowings 

we have a 7500 million commercial paper program under which we may issue commercial paper in the united states our commercial paper is currently rated a1 by standard  poor’s and p1 by moody’s our longterm credit ratings are a with a stable outlook by standard  poor’s and a1 with a stable outlook by moody’s at june 30 2006 we had no commercial paper outstanding we also have an effective shelf registration statement covering the potential issuance of up to an additional 3000 million in debt securities and 1502 million in additional uncommitted credit facilities of which 209 million was used as of june 30 2006 

we have an unused 6000 million senior revolving credit facility that expires on may 27 2010 the facility may be used for general corporate purposes including financing working capital and also as credit support for our commercial paper program up to the equivalent of 2500 million of the facility is available for multicurrency loans the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on libor or on the higher of prime which is the rate of interest publicly announced by the administrative agent or the federal funds rate plus ½ the credit facility has an annual fee of 04 million payable quarterly based on our current credit ratings as of june 30 2006 we were in compliance with all related financial and other restrictive covenants including limitations on indebtedness and liens 

  

  

in may 2006 we entered into a fixed rate promissory note agreement with a financial institution for the primary purpose of funding cash dividend repatriations from certain of our international affiliates to the united states as permitted by the ajca under the agreement we may borrow up to 1500 million in the form of loan participation notes which were issued by one of our subsidiaries in europe the interest rate on borrowings under this agreement will be an allin fixed rate determined by the lender and agreed to by us at the date of each borrowing at june 30 2006 380 million was outstanding under this agreement and the notes are being refinanced on a periodic basis as they mature at the then prevailing market interest rates debt issuance costs incurred related to this agreement were de minimis 

in march 2006 we entered into a 30 billion yen revolving credit facility that expires on march 24 2009 the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on tibor tokyo interbank offered rate and a 10 basis point facility fee is incurred on the undrawn balance we borrowed 30 billion yen under the new facility on march 28 2006 to repay the previously outstanding 30 billion yen term loan that was to mature on that date the outstanding balance at june 30 2006 262 million at the exchange rate at june 30 2006 is classified as shortterm debt on our consolidated balance sheet 

in october 2005 we redeemed the remaining 684 million of the 2015 preferred stock that was outstanding at june 30 2005 and paid the accrued dividends thereon 

our business is seasonal in nature and accordingly our working capital needs vary from time to time we may enter into investing and financing transactions that require additional funding to the extent that these needs exceed cash from operations we could subject to market conditions issue commercial paper or loan participation notes issue longterm debt securities or borrow under the revolving credit facility or other credit facilities 

total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 24 at june 30 2006 and 30 at june 30 2005 

the effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years generally we have been able to introduce new products at higher selling prices or increase selling prices sufficiently to offset cost increases which have been moderate 

we believe that cash on hand cash generated from operations available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business operations and capital expenditures on both a nearterm and longterm basis 

cash flows 

net cash provided by operating activities was 7098 million in fiscal 2006 as compared with 4781 million in fiscal 2005 the net increase in operating cash flows for fiscal 2006 as compared with fiscal 2005 primarily reflected favorable changes in certain working capital accounts partially offset by a decrease in net earnings from continuing operations net accounts receivable balances decreased primarily reflecting higher collections domestically during fiscal 2006 inventory levels remained constant at june 30 2006 as compared to june 30 2005 due to our efforts to better manage our inventory increases in other accrued liabilities primarily reflected higher advertising merchandising and sampling accruals compared to the prior year as well as significant deferred compensation and supplemental pension payments made to retired executives in fiscal 2005 additional increases in other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities reflected accrued employee separation benefits related to the company’s cost savings initiative 

net cash provided by operating activities was 4781 million in fiscal 2005 and 6730 million in fiscal 2004 the net decrease reflected changes in certain working capital accounts partially offset by decreases in net deferred taxes and an increase in net earnings from continuing operations the change in other accrued liabilities primarily reflected the payment of significant deferred compensation and supplemental payments made to retired executives in fiscal 2005 accounts receivable increased as a result of sales growth in fiscal 2005 reflecting growth in international markets and customers which generally carry longer payment terms the timing of payments from certain domestic customers as well as shipments that occurred later in the period also contributed to increased accounts receivable the increase in inventory was primarily due to actual and anticipated sales levels the building of safety stock in our new distribution center in europe and to a lesser extent the inclusion of new points of distribution the shift in cash activities related to accounts payable reflected the timing of disbursements yearoveryear as well as the initiation of a vendormanaged inventory program net deferred taxes decreased primarily due to the thenanticipated repatriation of foreign earnings in fiscal 2006 as a result of the ajca and the realization of the tax benefits related to payments made to retired executives 

net cash used for investing activities was 3032 million in fiscal 2006 compared with 2370 million in fiscal 2005 and 2137 million in fiscal 2004 the increase in cash flows used for investing activities during fiscal 2006 primarily reflected the cash payment related to the jo malone limited earnout provision and to a lesser extent aveda distributor acquisitions capital expenditures also increased in fiscal 2006 primarily reflecting our continuing companywide initiative to upgrade our information systems which was initiated in fiscal 2005 fiscal 2005 capital expenditures reflected those costs related to our information systems as well as the investment in leasehold improvements in our corporate offices capital expenditures in fiscal 2004 primarily reflected the continued upgrade of manufacturing equipment dies and molds new store openings store improvements counter construction and information technology enhancements in fiscal 2007 we expect to purchase the remaining equity interest in bumble and bumble products llc and bumble and bumble llc

dividends 

on november 10 2005 the board of directors declared an annual dividend of 40 per share or 855 million on our class a and class b common stock which was paid on december 28 2005 to stockholders of record at the close of business on december 9 2005 the annual common stock dividend declared during fiscal 2005 was 40 per share or 901 million which was paid on december 28 2004 to stockholders of record at the close of business on december 10 2004 dividends on the 2015 preferred stock were 05 million and 09 million for the fiscal years ended june 30 2006 and 2005 respectively these dividends have been characterized as interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings for the respective fiscal years 

pension plan funding and expense 

we maintain pension plans covering substantially all of our fulltime employees for our us operations and a majority of our international operations several plans provide pension benefits based primarily on years of service and employees’ earnings in the united states we maintain a trustbased noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan “us qualified plan” additionally we have an unfunded nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations our international pension plans are comprised of defined benefit and defined contribution plans 

several factors influence our annual funding requirements for the us qualified plan our funding policy consists of annual contributions at a rate that provides for future plan benefits and maintains appropriate funded percentages such contribution is not less than the minimum required by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended “erisa” and subsequent pension legislation and is not more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes for each international plan our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations in addition amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions as detailed in “ critical accounting polices and estimates ” the effect of our pension plan funding on future operating results will depend on economic conditions employee demographics mortality rates the number of participants electing to take lumpsum distributions investment performance and funding decisions 

for fiscal 2006 and 2005 there was no minimum contribution to the us qualified plan required by erisa however while we did not make any cash contributions pursuant to the plan during fiscal 2006 we made cash contributions of 20 million during fiscal 2005 at management’s discretion during fiscal 2007 we do not expect to make any cash contributions to the us qualified plan 

for fiscal 2006 and 2005 we made benefit payments under our nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan of 74 million and 50 million respectively we expect to make benefit payments under this plan during fiscal 2007 of 103 million for fiscal 2006 and 2005 we made cash contributions to our international pension plans of 257 million and 292 million respectively we expect to make contributions under these plans during fiscal 2007 of 188 million 

in addition at june 30 2006 and 2005 we recognized a liability on our balance sheet for each pension plan if the fair market value of the assets of that plan was less than the accumulated benefit obligation and accordingly a benefit or a charge was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders’ equity for the change in such liability during fiscal 2006 we recorded a benefit net of deferred tax of 299 million while in fiscal 2005 we recorded a charge net of deferred tax of 114 million to accumulated other comprehensive income loss

certain of our business acquisition agreements include “earnout” provisions these provisions generally require that we pay to the seller or sellers of the business additional amounts based on the performance of the acquired business the payments typically are made after a certain period of time and our next earnout payment will be made in fiscal 2007 when we expect to purchase the remaining equity interest in bumble and bumble products llc and bumble and bumble llc since the size of each payment depends upon performance of the acquired business we do not expect that such payments will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or financial condition 

for additional contingencies refer to “item 3 legal proceedings”

derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 

we address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments we primarily enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates we also enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the effects of fluctuating interest rates we categorize these instruments as entered into for purposes other than trading 

for each derivative contract entered into where we look to obtain special hedge accounting treatment we formally document the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item as well as its riskmanagement objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge the nature of the risk being hedged how the hedging instruments’ effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively and a description of the method of measuring ineffectiveness this process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as fairvalue cashflow or foreigncurrency hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions we also formally assess both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items if it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective then we will be required to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively 

foreign exchange risk management 

we enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge anticipated transactions as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies for periods consistent with our identified exposures the purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on our costs and on the cash flows that we receive from foreign subsidiaries almost all foreign currency contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries and are with large financial institutions rated as strong investment grade by a major rating agency we also enter into foreign currency options to hedge anticipated transactions where there is a high probability that anticipated exposures will materialize the forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options entered into to hedge anticipated transactions have been designated as cashflow hedges hedge effectiveness of forward exchange contracts is based on a hypothetical derivative methodology and excludes the portion of fair value attributable to the spotforward difference which is recorded in currentperiod earnings hedge effectiveness of foreign currency option contracts is based on a dollar offset methodology the ineffective portion of both forward exchange and foreign currency option contracts is recorded in currentperiod earnings for hedge contracts that are no longer deemed highly effective hedge accounting is discontinued and gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are reclassified to earnings when the underlying forecasted transaction occurs if it is probable that the forecasted transaction will no longer occur then any gains or losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are reclassified to currentperiod earnings as of june 30 2006 these cashflow hedges were highly effective in all material respects 

as a matter of policy we only enter into contracts with counterparties that have at least an “a” or equivalent credit rating the counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions we do not have significant exposure to any one counterparty our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to only the recognized but not realized gains attributable to the contracts management believes risk of default under these hedging contracts is remote and in any event would not be material to the consolidated financial results the contracts have varying maturities through the end of june 2007 costs associated with entering into such contracts have not been material to our consolidated financial results we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

  

at june 30 2006 we had foreign currency contracts in the form of forward exchange contracts and option contracts in the amount of 7826 million and 1302 million respectively the foreign currencies included in forward exchange contracts notional value stated in us dollars are principally the euro 2385 million swiss franc 985 million british pound 924 million canadian dollar 717 million japanese yen 506 million australian dollar 505 million and south korean won 331 million the foreign currencies included in the option contracts notional value stated in us dollars are principally the japanese yen 320 million euro 277 million canadian dollar 228 million swiss franc 148 million and south korean won 134 million 

interest rate risk management 

we enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the exposure to fluctuations of interest rates on our funded and unfunded indebtedness for periods consistent with the identified exposures all interest rate derivative contracts are with large financial institutions rated as strong investment grade by a major rating agency 

we have an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 2500 million to effectively convert fixed interest on the existing 2500 million 6 senior notes to variable interest rates based on sixmonth libor we designated the swap as a fairvalue hedge as of june 30 2006 the fairvalue hedge was highly effective in all material respects 

market risk 

we use a valueatrisk model to assess the market risk of our derivative financial instruments valueatrisk represents the potential losses for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors for a specified time period and confidence level we estimate valueatrisk across all of our derivative financial instruments using a model with historical volatilities and correlations calculated over the past 250day period the measured valueatrisk calculated as an average for the twelve months ended june 30 2006 related to our foreign exchange contracts and our interest rate contracts was 108 million and 77 million respectively   the model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 percent confidence level we used a statistical simulation model that valued our derivative financial instruments against one thousand randomly generated market price paths 

our calculated valueatrisk exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may or may not occur it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated based upon actual fluctuations in market rates operating exposures and the timing thereof and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year 

we believe however that any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the derivative financial instrument was intended 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not maintain any offbalance sheet arrangements transactions obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations 

recently issued accounting standards 

in june 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation number “fin” 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” “fin 48” fin 48 establishes a recognition threshold and measurement for income tax positions recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 109 “accounting for income taxes” fin 48 also prescribes a twostep evaluation process for tax positions the first step is recognition and the second is measurement for recognition an enterprise judgmentally determines whether it is morelikelythannot that a tax position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position if the tax position meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold it is measured and recognized in the financial statements as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized if a tax position does not meet the morelikelythannot recognition threshold the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements 

tax positions that meet the morelikelythannot recognition threshold at the effective date of fin 48 may be recognized or continue to be recognized upon adoption of fin 48 the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of fin 48 shall be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for that fiscal year fin 48 will apply to fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 with earlier adoption permitted we are currently evaluating the impact fin 48 will have on our consolidated financial statements when it becomes effective for us in fiscal 2008 and are unable at this time to quantify the impact if any to retained earnings at the time of adoption

as is customary in the cosmetics industry our practice is to accept returns of our products from retailers if properly requested authorized and approved in accepting returns we typically provide a credit to the retailer against sales and accounts receivable from that retailer on a dollarfordollar basis in recognition of this practice and in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles we report sales levels on a net basis which is computed by deducting the amount of actual returns received and an amount established for anticipated returns from gross sales as a percentage of gross sales returns were 47 46 and 51 in fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively

marketing 

  

our marketing strategy is built around our vision statement “bringing the best to everyone we touch” mrs estée lauder formulated this marketing philosophy to provide highquality service and products as the foundation for a solid and loyal consumer base 

  

our marketing efforts focus principally on promoting the quality and benefits of our products each of our brands is distinctively positioned has a single global image and is promoted with consistent logos packaging and advertising designed to enhance its image and differentiate it from other brands we regularly advertise our products on television and radio in upscale magazines and newspapers and through direct mail and photo displays at international airports in addition our products receive extensive editorial coverage in prestige publications and other media worldwide promotional activities and instore displays are designed to introduce existing consumers to different products in the line and to attract new consumers our marketing efforts also benefit from cooperative advertising programs with retailers some of which are supported by coordinated promotions such as purchase with purchase and gift with purchase at instore counters sales representatives offer personal demonstrations to market individual products as well as to provide education on basic skin care and makeup application we conduct extensive sampling programs and we pioneered gift with purchase as a sampling program we believe that the quality and perceived benefits of sample products have been effective inducements to purchases by new and existing consumers 

  

starting with the launch of the clinique website in 1996 we have used the internet to educate and inform consumers about certain of our brands currently we have eighteen singlebrand marketing sites twelve of which have ecommerce capabilities and glosscom our majorityowned multibrand marketing and ecommerce site 

  

most of our creative marketing work is done by inhouse creative teams the creative staff designs and produces the sales materials advertisements and packaging for all products in each brand total advertising and promotional expenditures were 18125 million 16120 million and 14161 million for fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively these amounts include expenses relating to purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions that are reflected in net sales and cost of sales 

  

our marketing and sales executives spend considerable time in the field meeting with consumers and key retailers and consulting with sales representatives at the points of sale these include estée lauder beauty advisors clinique consultants aramis selling specialists prescriptives analysts origins guides and m ž a ž c makeup artists

  

information systems 

  

information systems support business processes including product development marketing sales order processing production distribution and finance of the many systems currently being utilized the most significant to our business needs are i a centralized data repository of essential attributes for each of the products we offer or plan to offer which enables us to globally manufacture and market products of consistent quality ii a sales analysis system to track weekly sales at the stock keeping unit sku level at most significant retail sales locations ie sellthrough data increasing our understanding of consumer preferences and enabling us to coordinate more effectively our product development manufacturing and marketing strategies iii an automated replenishment system with many of our key domestic customers allowing us to replenish inventories for individual points of sale automatically with minimal paperwork and iv an inventory management system to provide us with a global view of finished goods availability relative to actual requirements facilitating inventory control and distribution for both existing product lines and new product launches 

  

the efficiencies provided by these systems have resulted in increased sales fewer outofstocks and reduced retail inventories we expect that these systems will continue to provide inventory and sales efficiencies in the short and medium terms as part of our longterm effort to enhance these efficiencies we are implementing enterprisewide global programs that we expect will deliver a single set of integrated data processes and technologies which would be scalable and used to standardize business processes across brands operating units and sales affiliates 

  

  

research and development 

  

we believe that we are an industry leader in the development of new products marketing product development and packaging groups work with our research and development group to identify shifts in consumer preferences develop new products and redesign or reformulate existing products in addition research and development personnel work closely with quality assurance and manufacturing personnel on a worldwide basis to ensure consistent global standards for our products and to deliver products with attributes that fulfill consumer expectations

we have established a global distribution network designed to meet the changing demands of our customers while maintaining service levels we are continuously evaluating and restructuring this physical distribution network we intend to establish regional inventory centers strategically positioned throughout the world in order to facilitate timely delivery of our products to our customers 

  

the principal raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are essential oils alcohol and specialty chemicals we also purchase packaging components that are manufactured to our design specifications procurement of materials for all manufacturing facilities is generally made on a global basis through our centralized supplier relations department a concentrated effort in supplier rationalization has been made with the specific objective of reducing costs increasing innovation and improving quality as a result of sourcing initiatives there is increased dependency on certain suppliers but we believe that these suppliers have adequate resources and facilities to overcome any unforeseen interruption of supply we are continually benchmarking the performance of the supply chain and will add or delete suppliers based upon the changing needs of the business we have in the past been able to obtain an adequate supply of essential raw materials and currently believe we have adequate sources of supply for virtually all components of our products as we integrate acquired brands we continually seek new ways to leverage our production and sourcing capabilities to improve manufacturing performance

 item 1a risk factors 

  

there are risks associated with an investment in our securities including 

  

the beauty business is highly competitive and if we are unable to compete effectively our results will suffer 

  

we face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world including multinational consumer product companies some of these competitors have greater resources than we do competition in the beauty business is based on pricing of products innovation perceived value service to the consumer promotional activities advertising special events new product introductions electronic commerce initiatives and other activities it is difficult for us to predict the timing and scale of our competitors’ actions in these areas also the trend toward consolidation in the retail trade particularly in developed markets such as the united states and western europe has resulted in us becoming increasingly dependent on key retailers including largeformat retailers who have increased their bargaining strength our ability to compete also depends on the continued strength of our brands our ability to attract and retain key talent the efficiency of our manufacturing facilities and distribution network and our ability to protect our intellectual property our failure to continue to compete effectively in countries around the world could have an adverse impact on our business 

  

our inability to anticipate and respond to market trends and changes in consumer preferences could adversely affect our financial results 

  

our continued success depends on our ability to anticipate gauge and react in a timely and costeffective manner to changes in consumer tastes for skin care makeup fragrance and hair care products as well as to where and how consumers shop for those products we must continually work to develop produce and market new products maintain and enhance the recognition of our brands achieve a favorable mix of products and refine our approach as to how and where we market and sell our products while we devote considerable effort and resources to shape analyze and respond to consumer preferences we recognize that consumer tastes cannot be predicted with certainty and can change rapidly if we are unable to anticipate and respond to trends in the market for cosmetics products and changing consumer demands our financial results will suffer 

  

a general economic downturn or sudden disruption in business conditions may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items which could adversely affect our financial results 

  

the general level of consumer spending is affected by a number of factors including general economic conditions inflation interest rates energy costs and consumer confidence generally all of which are beyond our control consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower and may impact sales of our products in addition sudden disruptions in business conditions for example as a consequence of events such as the outbreak of sars in 2003 or those that are currently taking place in the middle east or as a result of a terrorist attack similar to the events of september 11 2001 in the united states or the july 2005 events in the united kingdom including further attacks retaliation and the threat of further attacks or retaliation can have a short and sometimes longterm impact on consumer spending events that impact consumers’ willingness to travel may impact our travel retail business which is a significant contributor to our overall results a downturn in the economies in which we sell our products or a sudden disruption of business conditions in those economies could adversely affect our sales 

  

changes in laws regulations and polices that affect our business could adversely affect our financial results 

  

our business is subject to numerous laws regulations and policies changes in the laws regulations and policies that affect or will affect our business including changes in accounting standards tax laws and regulations trade rules and customs regulations and the outcome and expense of legal or regulatory proceedings and any action we may take as a result could adversely affect our financial results

•   changes in foreign laws regulations and policies including restrictions on trade import and export license requirements and tariffs and taxes as well as changes in united states laws and regulations relating to foreign trade and investment and

a disruption in operations could adversely affect our business and financial results 

  

as a company engaged in manufacturing and distribution on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including industrial accidents environmental events strikes and other labor disputes disruptions in logistics or information systems loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites product quality control safety licensing requirements and other regulatory issues as well as natural disasters and other external factors over which we have no control if such an event were to occur it could have an adverse affect on our business and financial results

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition at june 30 2005 and our results of operations for the three fiscal years ended june 30 2005 are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements these judgments can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition concentration of credit risk inventory pension and other postretirement benefit costs goodwill and other intangible assets income taxes and derivatives 

  

management of the company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of the company’s board of directors 

  

  

revenue recognition 

revenues from merchandise sales are recognized upon transfer of ownership including passage of title to the customer and transfer of the risk of loss related to those goods in the americas region sales are generally recognized at the time the product is shipped to the customer and in the europe middle east  africa and asiapacific regions sales are generally recognized based upon the customer’s receipt in certain circumstances transfer of title takes place at the point of sale eg at our retail stores 

  

sales are reported on a net sales basis which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual product returns received discounts incentive arrangements with retailers and an amount established for anticipated product returns our practice is to accept product returns from retailers only if properly requested authorized and approved in accepting returns we typically provide a credit to the retailer against accounts receivable from that retailer as a percentage of gross sales returns were 47 46 and 51 in fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  

our sales return accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net sales this accrual is calculated based on a history of actual returns estimated future returns and information provided by authorized retailers regarding their inventory levels consideration of these factors results in an accrual for anticipated sales returns that reflects increases or decreases related to seasonal fluctuations experience has shown a relationship between retailer inventory levels and sales returns in the subsequent period as well as a consistent pattern of returns due to the seasonal nature of our business in addition as necessary specific accruals may be established for significant future known or anticipated events the types of known or anticipated events that we have considered and will continue to consider include but are not limited to the solvency of our customers store closings by retailers changes in the retail environment and our decision to continue or support new and existing products 

  

concentration of credit risk 

an entity is vulnerable to concentration of credit risk if it is exposed to risks of loss greater than it would have had it mitigated its risks through diversification of customers the significance of such credit risk depends on the extent and nature of the concentration 

  

we have three major customers that owned and operated retail stores that in the aggregate accounted for 14031 million or 22 of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2005 and 1879 million or 24 of our accounts receivable at june 30 2005 these customers sell products primarily within north america our two largest customers federated department stores inc and the may department stores company merged on august 30 2005 although management believes that our major customers are sound and creditworthy a severe adverse impact on their business operations could have a corresponding material adverse effect on our net sales cash flows andor financial condition 

  

in the ordinary course of business we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions in the amount of 289 million and 301 million as of june 30 2005 and 2004 respectively our allowance for doubtful accounts is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net earnings the allowance for doubtful accounts was reduced by 126 million 256 million and 303 million for customer deductions and writeoffs in fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively and increased by 114 million 239 million and 315 million for additional provisions in fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively this reserve is based upon the evaluation of accounts receivable aging specific exposures and historical trends 

  

inventory 

we state our inventory at the lower of cost or fair market value with cost being determined on the firstin firstout fifo method we believe fifo most closely matches the flow of our products from manufacture through sale the reported net value of our inventory includes saleable products promotional products raw materials and componentry and work in process that will be sold or used in future periods inventory cost includes raw materials direct labor and overhead 

  

we also record an inventory obsolescence reserve which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value based on various product sales projections this reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales in addition and as necessary we may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events 

  

pension and other postretirement benefit costs 

we offer the following benefits to some or all of our employees a domestic trustbased noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan “us qualified plan” and an unfunded nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations collectively with the us qualified plan the “domestic plans” a contributory defined contribution plan international pension plans which vary by country consisting of both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans deferred compensation and certain other postretirement benefits 

  

  

the amounts necessary to fund future payouts under these plans are subject to numerous assumptions and variables certain significant variables require us to make assumptions that are within our control such as an anticipated discount rate expected rate of return on plan assets and future compensation levels we evaluate these assumptions with our actuarial advisors and we believe they are within accepted industry ranges although an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a direct impact on reported net earnings 

  

the preretirement discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated longterm bonds for fiscal 2005 we used a preretirement discount rate for our domestic plans of 600 and varying rates on our international plans of between 225 and 600 the preretirement rate for our domestic plans is based on a bond portfolio that includes only longterm bonds with an aa rating or equivalent from a major rating agency we believe the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio is expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of our domestic plans for fiscal 2005 we used an expected return on plan assets of 775 for our us qualified plan and varying rates of between 325 and 750 for our international plans in determining the longterm rate of return for a plan we consider the historical rates of return the nature of the plan’s investments and an expectation for the plan’s investment strategies the us qualified plan asset allocation as of june 30 2005 was approximately 67 equity investments 26 fixed income investments and 7 other investments the asset allocation of our combined international plans as of june 30 2005 was approximately 62 equity investments 32 fixed income investments and 6 other investments the difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets is accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore affects our recorded obligations and recognized expenses in such future periods for fiscal 2005 our pension plans had actual returns on assets of 432 million as compared with expected returns on assets of 353 million which resulted in a net deferred gain of 79 million 

  

a 25 basispoint change in the discount rate or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have had the following effect on fiscal 2005 pension expense 

  

   

our postretirement plans are comprised of health care plans that could be impacted by health care cost trend rates which may have a significant effect on the amounts reported a onepercentagepoint change in assumed health care cost trend rates for fiscal 2005 would have had the following effects 

  

   

for fiscal 2006 we will use a preretirement discount rate for the domestic plans of 525 and varying rates for our international plans of between 175 and 525 we anticipate using an expected return on plan assets of 775 for the us qualified plan and varying rates for our international pension plans of between 275 and 750 the net change in these assumptions from those used in fiscal 2005 will cause approximately a 65 million increase in pension expense in fiscal 2006 we will continue to monitor the market conditions relative to these assumptions and adjust them accordingly 

  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets other intangible assets principally consist of purchased royalty rights and trademarks goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite life are not amortized 

  

on an annual basis or sooner if certain events or circumstances warrant we test goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment to determine the fair value of these intangible assets there are many assumptions and estimates used that directly impact the results of the testing we have the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose to mitigate undue influence we use industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management 

  

income taxes 

we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 109 “accounting for income taxes” this statement establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effects of income taxes that result from an enterprise’s activities during the current and preceding years it requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes 

  

  

as of june 30 2005 we have current net deferred tax assets of 853 million and noncurrent net deferred tax liabilities of 681 million the net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization as well as the continued application of currently anticipated tax rates included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance of approximately 51 million for deferred tax assets which relates to foreign tax loss carryforwards not utilized to date where management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the relevant jurisdiction based on our assessments no additional valuation allowance is required if we determine that a deferred tax asset will not be realizable an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will result in a reduction of earnings at that time 

  

we provide tax reserves for federal state local and international exposures relating to audit results tax planning initiatives and compliance responsibilities the development of these reserves requires judgments about tax issues potential outcomes and timing and is a subjective critical estimate although the outcome of these tax audits is uncertain in management’s opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for potential liabilities emanating from these reviews if actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates they could have a material impact on our results of operations 

  

derivatives 

we account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” as amended which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities this statement also requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and that they be measured at fair value 

  

we currently use derivative financial instruments to hedge certain anticipated transactions and interest rates as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies we do not utilize derivatives for trading or speculative purposes hedge effectiveness is documented assessed and monitored by employees who are qualified to make such assessments and monitor the instruments variables that are external to us such as social political and economic risks may have an impact on our hedging program and the results thereof for a discussion on the quantitative impact of market risks related to our derivative financial instruments refer to “ liquidity and capital resources –market risk” 

  

quantitative analysis 

during the threeyear period ended june 30 2005 there have not been material changes in the assumptions underlying these critical accounting policies nor to the related significant estimates since the results of our business underlying these assumptions have not differed significantly from our expectations 

  

while we believe that the estimates that we have made are proper and the related results of operations for the period are presented fairly in all material respects other assumptions could reasonably be justified that would change the amount of reported net sales cost of sales operating expenses or our provision for income taxes as they relate to the provisions for anticipated sales returns allowance for doubtful accounts inventory obsolescence reserve and income taxes for fiscal 2005 had these estimates been changed simultaneously by 25 in either direction our reported gross profit would have increased or decreased by approximately 45 million operating expenses would have changed by approximately 07 million and the provision for income taxes would have increased or decreased by approximately 08 million the collective impact of these changes on operating income net earnings and net earnings per diluted common share would be an increase or decrease of approximately 52 million 60 million and 003 respectively 

  

  

results of operations 

  

we manufacture market and sell skin care makeup fragrance and hair care products which are distributed in over 130 countries and territories the following table is a comparative summary of operating results for fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 and reflects the basis of presentation described in note 2 and note 17 to the notes to consolidated financial statements for all periods presented products and services that do not meet our definition of skin care makeup fragrance and hair care have been included in the “other” category 

  

in february 2004 we sold the assets and operations of our reporting unit that sold jane brand products based on an assessment of the tangible and intangible assets of this business we determined that the carrying amount of these assets as then reflected on our consolidated balance sheets exceeded their estimated fair value accordingly we recorded an aftertax charge to discontinued operations of 333 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2004 the charge represented the impairment of goodwill in the amount of 264 million the reduction in value of other tangible assets of 21 million net of tax and the operating loss of 48 million net of tax for the fiscal year ended june 30 2004 included in that operating loss were additional costs associated with the sale and discontinuation of the business all consolidated statement of earnings information for fiscal 2003 has been restated for comparative purposes including restatement of the makeup product category and the americas region data 

  

   

 refer to the following discussion in “fiscal 2004 as compared with fiscal 2003 – operating expenses” for further information regarding these charges 

  

  

the following table presents certain consolidated earnings data as a percentage of net sales 

  

   

fiscal 2005 as compared with fiscal 2004 

  

in order to meet the demands of consumers we continually introduce new products support new and established products through advertising sampling and merchandising and phase out existing products that no longer meet the needs of our consumers the economics of developing producing and launching these new products influence our sales and operating performance each period the introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products which we take into account in our business planning 

  

net sales   

net sales increased 9 or 5459 million to 63363 million reflecting growth in all major product categories led by makeup and skin care and growth in all geographic regions led by europe the middle east  africa excluding the impact of foreign currency translation net sales increased 7 

  

product categories 

  

skin care 

net sales of skin care products increased 10 or 2120 million to 23521 million approximately 179 million of this sales increase was related to the introduction of future perfect antiwrinkle radiance creme spf 15 and launches in the perfectionist and renutriv product lines by estée lauder launches of superdefense triple action moisturizers spf 25 and certain repairwear products by clinique the introduction of certain american beauty and good skin™ products and the recent launch of modern friction by origins on a combined basis strong sales of products in clinique’s 3step skin care system and the lifting face serum  the lifting intensifier by la mer contributed approximately 29 million to the sales increase partially offsetting these increases was a decrease of approximately 52 million in sales of perfectionist correcting serum for lineswrinkles idealist microd deep thermal refinisher and the white light and lightsource lines of products by estée lauder excluding the impact of foreign currency translation skin care net sales increased 7 

  

  

makeup 

makeup net sales increased 13 or 2748 million to 24231 million the growth included approximately 62 million of net sales from the launches of american beauty and flirt and higher sales of bobbi brown and stila products collectively an increase of approximately 105 million was attributable to the recent launches of superbalanced compact makeup spf 20 and colour surge eye shadow from clinique and lash xl maximum length mascara tender blush pure pops brushon color and aeromatte ultralucent pressed powder by estée lauder also contributing to sales growth was approximately 70 million of increased sales from m ž a ž c’s small eye shadow studio fix lustreglass and pro longwear lipcolour partially offsetting these increases was a decrease of approximately 38 million in sales of the high impact mascara and high impact eye shadow collections and the glosswear line of products by clinique as well as of pure color lip vinyl by estée lauder excluding the impact of foreign currency translation makeup net sales increased 11

  

fragrance 

net sales of fragrance products increased 3 or 395 million to 12606 million the increase was due to approximately 188 million in sales generated by the fiscal 2005 launches of dkny be delicious and dkny be delicious men true star from tommy hilfiger lauder beyond paradise men from estée lauder happy to be from clinique and donald trump the fragrance partially offsetting the new product sales were decreases in sales of approximately 92 million of estée lauder beyond paradise aramis life and clinique simply which were launched in the prior year as well as decreases in sales of approximately 49 million of tommy jeans and tommy from tommy hilfiger certain other aramis products and lauder intuition men from estée lauder excluding the impact of foreign currency translation fragrance net sales increased slightly we expect the fragrance category to remain challenging in fiscal 2006 

  

hair care 

hair care net sales increased 10 to 2739 million this increase amounting to 245 million was due to sales growth from aveda and bumble and bumble products aveda net sales increased as a result of sales of new professional color products and the introductions of pure abundance and damage remedy hair care products while bumble and bumble benefited from recent launches in its hair and scalp treatment line of products and the initial shipments of crème de coco shampoos and conditioners both of these brands also benefited from new points of distribution excluding the impact of foreign currency translation hair care net sales increased 9 

  

geographic regions 

net sales in the americas increased 7 or 2334 million to 33822 million this region experienced growth in all major categories which was fueled by the diversification in our product offerings as new products and brands mitigated challenges among certain core brands and successful prior year launches in the united states our makeup artist and hair care brands along with products from our aramis and designer fragrances division contributed approximately 147 million to the increase in addition higher net sales in canada and the inclusion of beautybank products contributed approximately 78 million collectively the americas region may be adversely impacted by the august 2005 merger of federated department stores inc and the may department stores company 

  

in europe the middle east  africa net sales increased 13 or 2484 million to 21186 million primarily due to higher net sales in the united kingdom our travel retail business spain portugal south africa and greece of approximately 181 million collectively the increase in net sales included benefits from the effect of the weaker us dollar as compared to various european currencies excluding the impact of foreign currency translation net sales in europe the middle east  africa increased 7 

  

net sales in asiapacific increased 8 or 641 million to 8355 million this increase reflected higher net sales of approximately 51 million in china hong kong australia and taiwan partially offset by lower sales in japan of approximately 3 million excluding the impact of foreign currency translation asiapacific net sales increased 4 

  

we strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market which may account for differences in regional sales growth 

  

cost of sales   

cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales was 255 and remained unchanged compared with the prior year favorable net changes in production and supply chain efforts of approximately 30 basis points primarily driven by favorable material sourcing were offset by the net change in the mix of our business within our geographic regions and product categories as discussed above which includes the impact of the beautybank brands changes in exchange rates compared with the prior year had a de minimis net impact on our cost of sales margin 

  

the higher price of oil is beginning to impact our cost of raw materials and componentry however we believe this will not have a material adverse effect on our cost of sales margin in the near future 

  

  

since certain promotional activities are a component of sales or cost of sales and the timing and level of promotions vary with our promotional calendar we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in the cost of sales percentage in addition future cost of sales mix may be impacted by the inclusion of new brands which have margin and product cost structures different from those of our existing brands 

  operating expenses   

operating expenses as a percentage of net sales improved to 631 from 634 in the prior fiscal year our planned increase in advertising merchandising and sampling over the prior year of approximately 50 basis points was offset in full by our ongoing cost containment efforts to maintain expenses in line with our business needs we also realized a benefit of approximately 30 basis points from the elimination of royalty payments previously made to mrs estée lauder in fiscal 2006 we will experience an increase in operating expenses due to the recognition of costs related to employee stockbased compensation as a result of the adoption of sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” see “ recently issued accounting standards ” 

  

changes in advertising sampling and merchandising spending result from the type timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts as well as the markets being emphasized 

  

operating results   

based on the growth of net sales our constant cost of sales margin and the improvement in our operating expense margin as previously discussed operating income increased 12 or 766 million to 7206 million as compared with the prior fiscal year operating margins were 114 of net sales in the current period as compared with 111 in the prior fiscal year 

  

product categories 

operating income increased 14 or 372 million in makeup and 9 or 295 million in skin care reflecting overall sales growth and sales of recently launched products operating results also increased 44 or 110 million in fragrance reflecting sales growth from new and recently launched products while we experienced improved results in fiscal 2005 due to these new launches the fragrance business continues to be challenging hair care operating results decreased 3 or 08 million reflecting an increase in operating expenses related to the growth of our business in the united states as well as the opening of new points of distribution in korea and japan partially offset by increases in net sales as previously discussed hair care results were also adversely impacted in fiscal 2005 by the need to make alternative arrangements due to the bankruptcy of a thirdparty supplier the situation was rectified during fiscal 2005 

  

geographic regions 

operating income in the americas increased 12 or 380 million to 3572 million primarily due to higher net sales resulting from an overall improvement in the retail environment strong product launches and growth from our newer brands as noted above we expect results in the americas region to be adversely impacted by the august 2005 merger of federated department stores inc and the may department stores company 

  

in europe the middle east  africa operating income increased 12 or 317 million to 3061 million primarily due to improved results from our travel retail business spain the united kingdom and switzerland of approximately 34 million collectively partially offsetting this improvement were lower results in france which was negatively impacted by the consolidation of major retailers and in russia where we converted our business from a distributor to a direct subsidiary of approximately 5 million on a combined basis 

  

in asiapacific operating income increased 14 or 69 million to 573 million this increase reflected improved results in hong kong taiwan thailand and japan of approximately 11 million collectively partially offset by a decrease in operating income in korea and china of approximately 6 million combined as china is an emerging market for us we have invested and plan to continue to invest in new brand expansion and business opportunities in addition the asiapacific region did not realize the benefits of spending behind new whitening products which experienced a delay in launching during fiscal 2005 

  

interest expense net   

net interest expense was 139 million as compared with 271 million in the prior year the decrease in net interest expense was due primarily to a 165 million decrease in preferred stock dividends as a result of the redemption of 2916 million aggregate principal amount of the 2015 preferred stock on june 10 2004 and the reduction in the dividend rate on the remaining 684 million of the 2015 preferred stock this improvement was partially offset by an increase in interest expense as a result of higher debt balances and to a lesser extent higher interest rates 

  

  

provision for income taxes   

the provision for income taxes represents federal foreign state and local income taxes the effective rate for income taxes for fiscal 2005 was 412 as compared with 377 in the prior year the effective rate differs from statutory rates due to the effect of state and local taxes tax rates in foreign jurisdictions the effect of repatriating foreign earnings and certain nondeductible expenses 

  

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 we formulated a plan to repatriate approximately 690 million of foreign earnings in fiscal 2006 which includes 500 million of extraordinary intercompany dividends under the provisions of the american jobs creation act of 2004 the “ajca” this action resulted in an aggregate tax charge of approximately 35 million in fiscal 2005 which included an incremental tax charge of approximately 28 million 

  

the increase in the effective income tax rate was attributable to the incremental tax charge resulting from the repatriation plan of approximately 390 basis points and an increase of approximately 120 basis points resulting from our foreign operations these increases were partially offset by a reduction in the amount of nondeductible preferred stock dividends of approximately 100 basis points a decrease in state and local income taxes of approximately 40 basis points and an increase in tax credits of approximately 20 basis points 

  

net earnings   

net earnings and diluted net earnings per common share increased approximately 19 and 20 respectively net earnings as compared with the prior fiscal year improved 640 million to 4061 million and diluted net earnings per common share improved to 178 from 148 net earnings from continuing operations increased by 307 million or 8 and diluted net earnings per common share from continuing operations increased 10 to 178 from 162 in the prior fiscal year the planned repatriation of foreign earnings in accordance with the ajca as discussed above resulted in an incremental tax charge of approximately 28 million or 012 per diluted common share as noted above net earnings in fiscal 2006 are expected to be adversely impacted by the adoption of sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” in addition we expect results in the americas region to be adversely impacted by the august 2005 merger of federated department stores inc and the may department stores company 

  

fiscal 2004 as compared with fiscal 2003 

  

net sales   

net sales increased 14 or 6944 million to 57904 million reflecting growth in all product categories and all geographic regions led by doubledigit growth in europe the middle east  africa and asiapacific and the inclusion of a full year of net sales of the darphin line of products which was acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 net sales results in europe the middle east  africa and asiapacific benefited from the weakening of the us dollar excluding the impact of foreign currency translation net sales increased 9 

  

product categories 

  

skin care 

net sales of skin care products increased 13 or 2464 million to 21401 million approximately 60 million of this increase was attributable to the new launches of hydra complete multilevel moisture cream and idealist microd deep thermal refinisher by estée lauder and pore minimizer by clinique additionally growth of approximately 134 million was due to strong sales of clinique’s 3step skin care system and the repairwear line of products from clinique renutriv intensive lift serum and renutriv intensive eye crème by estée lauder and the inclusion of a full year of net sales of the darphin line of products which are primarily skin care partially offsetting these increases were approximately 34 million of lower net sales of certain existing products such as advanced stop signs by clinique and white light and lightsource product lines by estée lauder excluding the impact of foreign currency translation skin care net sales increased 8 

  

makeup 

makeup net sales increased 14 or 2605 million to 21483 million in part due to net sales increases of our m ž a ž c and bobbi brown makeup artist lines of approximately 122 million collectively the increase in net sales also reflected approximately 79 million from the fiscal 2004 launches of ideal matte refinishing makeup spf 8 and electric intense lipcreme by estée lauder and perfectly real makeup and colour surge bare brilliance by clinique also contributing to net sales growth were strong sales of approximately 53 million of high impact mascara high impact eye shadow and skin clarifying makeup by clinique as well as pure color lip vinyl and artist’s lip and eye pencils from estée lauder partially offsetting these increases were approximately 30 million of lower net sales of certain existing products such as so ingenious multidimension liquid makeup and pure color lipstick from estée lauder and moisture surge lipstick from clinique excluding the impact of foreign currency translation makeup net sales increased 10

  

  

fragrance 

net sales of fragrance products increased 15 or 1615 million to 12211 million primarily attributable to the fiscal 2004 launches of estée lauder beyond paradise aramis life clinique simply and the tommy jeans collection which together contributed approximately 194 million to the growth these product launches primarily contributed to increased fragrance net sales outside the united states and are inclusive of improved results from our travel retail business these net sales increases were partially offset by lower net sales of estée lauder pleasures  intuition and beautiful certain tommy hilfiger products and clinique happy of approximately 90 million collectively excluding the impact of foreign currency translation fragrance net sales increased 10 

  

hair care 

hair care net sales increased 9 or 205 million to 2494 million this increase resulted from sales growth from aveda and bumble and bumble products due to an increase in sales at existing salons and spas new salon and spa openings and the success of new and existing products aveda net sales also increased as a result of the opening of new companyowned aveda experience centers partially offsetting the increase were lower net sales of clinique’s simple hair care system excluding the impact of foreign currency translation hair care net sales increased 7 

  

the introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products which we take into account in our business planning 

  

geographic regions 

net sales in the americas increased 7 or 2170 million to 31488 million primarily reflecting growth from our newer brands the success of newly launched products and increases from most of our freestanding retail stores all of which reflected the strengthening retail environment 

  

in europe the middle east  africa net sales increased 24 or 3638 million to 18702 million about 272 million was due to higher net sales from our travel retail business the united kingdom spain greece and south africa as well as the inclusion of a full year of net sales of the darphin line of products the increase includes the favorable effects of foreign currency exchange rates to the us dollar excluding the impact of foreign currency translation net sales in europe the middle east  africa increased 14 

  

net sales in asiapacific increased 17 or 1136 million to 7714 million primarily due to higher net sales of approximately 83 million in japan australia taiwan china and thailand excluding the impact of foreign currency translation net sales in asiapacific increased 9 

  

we strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market which may account for differences in regional sales growth 

  

cost of sales 

  

cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales improved to 255 from 260 reflecting production and supply chain efficiencies of approximately 70 basis points and lower costs from promotional activities of approximately 60 basis points partially offsetting these improvements were changes in exchange rates of approximately 40 basis points and costs related to inventory obsolescence and reconditioning and rehandling of goods of approximately 20 basis points also offsetting these improvements were costs associated with higher travel retail sales which contributed approximately 10 basis points travel retail has a higher cost of goods sold percentage because of its higher mix of fragrance sales coupled with its margin structure 

  

since certain promotional activities are a component of sales or cost of sales and the timing and level of promotions vary with our promotional calendar we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in the cost of sales percentage in addition future cost of sales mix may be impacted by the inclusion of new brands which have margin and product cost structures different than our existing brands 

  

operating expenses 

  

our fiscal 2003 results as reported in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” included an adjustment for a special pretax charge of 220 million or 135 million after tax equal to 06 per diluted common share in connection with the proposed settlement of a class action lawsuit brought against us and a number of other defendants the amount of the charge in this case is significantly larger than similar charges we have incurred individually or in the aggregate for legal proceedings in any prior year and at that time we did not expect to take a charge of a similar magnitude for a single matter like it in the near future in the following discussions we include the results as reported and the nongaap results we have presented the nongaap results because of the special nature of the charge which affects comparability from period to period we believe that such measures provide investors with a view of our ongoing business trends and results of continuing operations this is consistent with the approach used by management in its evaluation and monitoring of such trends and results and provides investors with a base for evaluating future periods there were no events or transactions subsequent to fiscal 2003 for which we believe such a discussion would be relevant 

  

  

in fiscal 2003 operating expenses and operating income in accordance with gaap were 32679 million or 641 of net sales and 5037 million or 99 of net sales respectively before the charge nongaap results operating expenses would have been 32459 million or 637 of net sales and operating income would have been 5257 million or 103 of net sales 

  

while we consider the nongaap financial measures useful in analyzing our results it is not intended to replace or act as a substitute for any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with gaap 

  

fiscal 2004 operating expenses decreased to 634 of net sales as compared with 641 of net sales in fiscal 2003 before considering the effect of the special charge operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points from 637 in fiscal 2003 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased approximately 100 basis points primarily due to the higher growth rate in net sales particularly in the travel retail business as well as our ongoing cost containment efforts to maintain expenses in line with our business needs partially offset by operating expenses related to beautybank the higher operating costs associated with newly acquired brands and expenses related to compliance with new regulatory requirements such as those arising under the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 partially offsetting the net favorability in fiscal 2004 were higher levels of advertising merchandising and sampling expenses incurred to support new and recently launched products of approximately 70 basis points 

  

changes in advertising sampling and merchandising spending result from the type timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts as well as the markets being emphasized 

  

under agreements covering our purchase of trademarks for a percentage of related sales royalty payments totaling 188 million and 203 million in fiscal 2004 and 2003 respectively have been charged to expense such payments were made to mrs estée lauder until her death on april 24 2004 after which time the final payments ceased to accrue and were made to a trust this event resulted in a reduction of operating expenses in fiscal 2004 of 37 million or 22 million after tax we realized a benefit from the elimination of these royalty payments in fiscal 2005 

  

operating results 

  

operating income increased 28 or 1403 million to 6440 million operating margins were 111 of net sales in fiscal 2004 as compared with 99 in fiscal 2003 absent the special charge operating income increased 23 or 1183 million and operating margins increased 80 basis points from fiscal 2003 these increases in operating income and operating margin reflect sales growth improvements in the components of cost of sales and a reduction in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales 

  

net earnings and diluted net earnings per common share increased approximately 7 and 17 respectively net earnings improved 223 million to 3421 million and diluted net earnings per common share increased by 17 from 126 to 148 net earnings from continuing operations increased by 498 million or 15 and diluted net earnings per common share from continuing operations increased 26 to 162 from 129 in the prior year absent the special charge net earnings from continuing operations increased by 363 million or 11 and diluted net earnings per common share from continuing operations increased 21 from 135 

  

the following discussions of operating results by product categories and geographic regions exclude the impact of the fiscal 2003 special charge we believe the following analysis of operating income better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business 

  

product categories 

operating income increased 23 to 3363 million in skin care 25 to 2577 million in makeup and 59 to 236 million in hair care reflecting overall sales growth and new product launches operating income decreased 23 to 248 million in fragrance reflecting the softness in that product category in the united states as well as increased support spending related to new product launch activities 

  

geographic regions 

operating income in the americas increased 25 or 639 million to 3192 million due to sales growth resulting from an improved retail environment strong product launches and growth from newer brands in europe the middle east  africa operating income increased 21 or 467 million to 2744 million primarily due to significantly improved results from our travel retail business improved operating results in the united kingdom and spain as well as the addition of a full year of results of the darphin line of products all of which contributed approximately 71 million to the increase partially offsetting these increases were approximately 26 million of lower gains on foreign exchange transactions and lower results in switzerland and italy due to difficult market conditions collectively in asiapacific operating income increased 18 or 77 million to 504 million this increase reflected improved results in taiwan hong kong and thailand partially offset by lower results in korea of approximately 7 million combined 

  

  

interest expense net 

  

net interest expense was 271 million as compared with 81 million in fiscal 2003 the increase in net interest expense was due to the inclusion of the dividends on redeemable preferred stock of 174 million as interest expense in fiscal 2004 this change in reporting resulted from a change in accounting standards which prohibited us from restating fiscal 2003 results to a lesser extent interest expense was also affected by higher average net borrowings and a marginally higher effective interest rate on our debt portfolio 

  

provision for income taxes 

  

the provision for income taxes represents federal foreign state and local income taxes the effective rate for income taxes for fiscal 2004 was 377 as compared with 329 in fiscal 2003 these rates differ from statutory rates reflecting the effect of state and local taxes tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and certain nondeductible expenses the increase in the effective income tax rate was attributable to the inclusion of the dividends on redeemable preferred stock as interest expense which are not deductible for income tax purposes approximately 100 basis points the mix of global earnings approximately 150 basis points and to a lesser extent the timing of certain tax planning initiatives the fiscal 2003 rate included benefits derived from certain favorable tax negotiations approximately 230 basis points 

  

financial condition 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations and borrowings under commercial paper borrowings from the issuance of longterm debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks and other lenders in the united states and abroad at june 30 2005 we had cash and cash equivalents of 5533 million compared with 6116 million at june 30 2004 

  

at june 30 2005 our outstanding borrowings of 7147 million included i 2463 million of 6 senior notes due january 2012 consisting of 2500 million principal unamortized debt discount of 08 million and a 29 million adjustment to reflect the fair value of an outstanding interest rate swap ii 1974 million of 575 senior notes due october 2033 consisting of 2000 million principal and unamortized debt discount of 26 million iii 684 million of 2015 preferred stock which shares have been put to us and we intend to redeem them on october 26 2005 iv a 30 billion yen term loan approximately 272 million at the exchange rate at june 30 2005 which is due in march 2006 v a 18 million euro note approximately 22 million at the exchange rate at june 30 2005 payable semiannually through february 2008 at a variable interest rate vi 90 million of capital lease obligations vii 1480 million of outstanding shortterm commercial paper payable through july 2005 at an average interest rate of 308 and viii 162 million of other shortterm borrowings 

  

we have a 7500 million commercial paper program under which we may issue commercial paper in the united states our commercial paper is currently rated a1 by standard  poor’s and p1 by moody’s our longterm credit ratings are a with a stable outlook by standard  poor’s and a1 with a stable outlook by moody’s at june 30 2005 we had 1480 million of commercial paper outstanding which is being refinanced on a periodic basis as it matures at then prevailing market interest rates we also have an effective shelf registration statement covering the potential issuance of up to an additional 3000 million in debt securities and 1685 million in additional uncommitted credit facilities of which 162 million was used as of june 30 2005 

  

effective may 27 2005 we entered into a fiveyear 6000 million senior revolving credit facility expiring on may 27 2010 the new facility replaced our prior unused 4000 million revolving credit facility which was effective since june 28 2001 the new revolving credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes including financing working capital and also as credit support for our commercial paper program up to the equivalent of 250 million of the facility is available for multicurrency loans the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on libor or on the higher of prime which is the rate of interest publicly announced by the administrative agent or ½ plus the federal funds rate we incurred debt issuance costs of 03 million which will be amortized over the term of the facility the credit facility has an annual fee of 04 million payable quarterly based on our current credit ratings as of june 30 2005 this facility was unused and we were in compliance with all related financial and other restrictive covenants including limitations on indebtedness and liens 

  

on june 28 2005 we received a notice of exercise of the put right from the holder of the remaining 684 million of the 2015 preferred stock which requires us to purchase the preferred stock plus any cumulative and unpaid dividends thereon on or before october 26 2005 we plan to purchase the preferred stock on that date and to pay the anticipated dividends from july 1 2005 through that date of 05 million at a rate based on the aftertax yield on sixmonth us treasuries of 210 which was reset on july 1 2005 

  

  

our business is seasonal in nature and accordingly our working capital needs vary from time to time we may enter into investing and financing transactions that require additional funding to the extent that our needs exceed cash from operations we could subject to market conditions issue commercial paper issue longterm debt securities or borrow under the revolving credit facility 

  

total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 30 at june 30 2005 as compared with 24 at june 30 2004 this increase primarily reflected the issuance of shortterm commercial paper in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 

  

the effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years generally we have been able to introduce new products at higher selling prices or increase selling prices sufficiently to offset cost increases which have been moderate 

  

we believe that our cash on hand cash generated from operations available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business operations and capital expenditures on both a nearterm and longterm basis 

  

cash flows 

net cash provided by operating activities was 4792 million in fiscal 2005 as compared with 6754 million in fiscal 2004 and 5586 million in fiscal 2003 the net decrease in operating cash flows for fiscal 2005 as compared with fiscal 2004 reflected changes in certain working capital accounts partially offset by decreases in net deferred taxes and an increase in net earnings from continuing operations the change in other accrued liabilities primarily reflected the payment of significant deferred compensation and supplemental payments made to retired executives in fiscal 2005 accounts receivable increased as a result of sales growth in the current fiscal year reflecting growth in international markets and customers which generally carry longer payment terms the timing of payments from certain domestic customers as well as shipments that occurred later in the period also contributed to increased accounts receivable the increase in inventory was primarily due to actual and anticipated sales levels the building of safety stock in our new distribution center in europe and to a lesser extent the inclusion of new points of distribution such as kohl’s department stores for our beautybank brands and new affiliate activities the shift in cash activities related to accounts payable reflected the timing of disbursements yearoveryear as well as the initiation of a vendormanaged inventory program net deferred taxes decreased primarily as a result of the anticipated repatriation of foreign earnings in fiscal 2006 as a result of the ajca and the realization of the tax benefits related to payments made to retired executives the improvement in net operating cash flows for fiscal 2004 as compared with fiscal 2003 reflected increased net earnings from continuing operations and an increase in accrued costs changes in operating assets and liabilities reflected partially offsetting increases in accounts payable and inventory in anticipation of product launches in fiscal 2005 higher accounts receivable in line with sales growth and changes in other assets and accrued liabilities that reflect receipts and accruals from employee compensation and benefit related transactions as well as selling advertising and merchandising activities 

  

net cash used for investing activities was 2370 million in fiscal 2005 compared with 2136 million in fiscal 2004 and 1980 million in fiscal 2003 net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2005 and 2004 primarily related to capital expenditures net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2003 primarily related to capital expenditures and the acquisition of darphin and certain aveda distributors in fiscal 2006 we expect to make a payment of approximately 38 million to satisfy an earnout provision related to our acquisition of jo malone limited in october 1999 which payment may be satisfied by the issuance of a note to the seller 

  

capital expenditures amounted to 2296 million 2121 million and 1686 million in fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively incremental spending in fiscal 2005 primarily reflected the beginning of a companywide initiative to upgrade our information systems as well as the investment in leasehold improvements in our corporate offices we plan to continue to invest in the upgrade of our information systems in fiscal 2006 and beyond capital expenditures in fiscal 2004 and 2003 primarily reflected the continued upgrade of manufacturing equipment dies and molds new store openings store improvements counter construction and information technology enhancements the lower level of capital expenditures in fiscal 2003 reflected tight control on our spending in light of thenprevailing economic conditions 

  

cash used for financing activities was 3004 million 2160 million and 5550 million in fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the net cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2005 primarily reflected common stock repurchases and dividend payments partially offset by the issuance of shortterm commercial paper to fund working capital needs and the receipt of proceeds from employee stock option transactions the net cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2004 primarily related to the redemption of 2916 million aggregate principal amount of the 2015 preferred stock common stock repurchases and dividend payments partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of the 575 senior notes and from employee stock option transactions net cash used for financing during fiscal 2003 primarily related to common stock repurchases the repayment of longterm debt and dividend payments 

  

  

dividends 

on november 3 2004 the board of directors declared an annual dividend of 40 per share on our class a and class b common stock which was paid on december 28 2004 to stockholders of record at the close of business on december 10 2004 common stock dividends paid in fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 were 901 million 685 million and 583 million respectively dividends paid on the preferred stock were 09 million 174 million and 234 million for the years ended june 30 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the decrease in preferred stock dividends in fiscal 2005 and 2004 primarily reflected the redemption of 2916 million aggregate principal amount of 2015 preferred stock on june 10 2004 and the reduction in the dividend rate on the remaining 684 million of the 2015 preferred stock the cumulative redeemable preferred stock dividends have been characterized as interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings for the fiscal years ended june 30 2005 and 2004 

  

pension plan funding and expense 

we maintain pension plans covering substantially all of our fulltime employees for our us operations and a majority of our international operations several plans provide pension benefits based primarily on years of service and employees’ earnings in the united states we maintain a trustbased noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan “us qualified plan” additionally we have an unfunded nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations our international pension plans are comprised of defined benefit and defined contribution plans 

  

several factors influence our annual funding requirements for the us qualified plan our funding policy consists of annual contributions at a rate that provides for future plan benefits and maintains appropriate funded percentages such contribution is not less than the minimum required by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended “erisa” and subsequent pension legislation and is not more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes for each international plan our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations in addition amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions as detailed in “ critical accounting polices and estimates ” the effect on operating results in the future of pension plan funding will depend on economic conditions employee demographics mortality rates the number of participants electing to take lumpsum distributions investment performance and funding decisions 

  

for fiscal 2005 and 2004 there was no minimum contribution to the us qualified plan required by erisa however at management’s discretion we made cash contributions to the us qualified plan of 20 million and 330 million during fiscal 2005 and 2004 respectively during fiscal 2006 we do not expect to make any cash contributions to the us qualified plan 

  

for fiscal 2005 and 2004 we made benefit payments under our nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan of 50 million and 25 million respectively we expect to make benefit payments under this plan during fiscal 2006 of 95 million for fiscal 2005 and 2004 we made cash contributions to our international pension plans of 292 million and 229 million respectively we expect to make contributions under these plans during fiscal 2006 of 199 million 

  

in addition at june 30 2005 and 2004 we recognized a liability on our balance sheet for each pension plan if the fair market value of the assets of that plan was less than the accumulated benefit obligation and accordingly a benefit or a charge was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders’ equity for the change in such liability during fiscal 2005 we recorded a charge net of deferred tax of 114 million while in fiscal 2004 we recorded a benefit net of deferred tax of 160 million to accumulated other comprehensive income loss 

  

commitments and contingencies 

on june 28 2005 we received a notice of exercise of the put right from the holder of the remaining 684 million of the 2015 preferred stock which requires us to purchase the preferred stock plus any cumulative and unpaid dividends thereon on or before october 26 2005 we intend to purchase the preferred stock on that date and pay the anticipated dividends from july 1 2005 through that date of 05 million at a rate based on the aftertax yield on sixmonth us treasuries of 210 which was reset on july 1 2005 

  

certain of our business acquisition agreements include “earnout” provisions these provisions generally require that we pay to the seller or sellers of the business additional amounts based on the performance of the acquired business the payments typically are made after a certain period of time and our next earnout payment will be made in fiscal 2006 since the size of each payment depends upon performance of the acquired business we do not expect that such payments will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or financial condition 

  

for additional contingencies refer to “ item 3 legal proceedings ” 

  

  

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes scheduled maturities of our contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed and determinable as of june 30 2005 

  

   

   

derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 

we address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments we primarily enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates we also enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the effects of fluctuating interest rates we categorize these instruments as entered into for purposes other than trading 

  

for each derivative contract entered into where we look to obtain special hedge accounting treatment we formally document the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item as well as its riskmanagement objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge this process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as fairvalue cashflow or foreigncurrency hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions we also formally assess both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items if it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective then we will be required to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively 

  

foreign exchange risk management 

we enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge anticipated transactions as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies for periods consistent with our identified exposures the purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on our costs and on the cash flows that we receive from foreign subsidiaries almost all foreign currency contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries and are with large financial institutions rated as strong investment grade by a major rating agency we also enter into foreign currency options to hedge anticipated transactions where there is a high probability that anticipated exposures will materialize the forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options entered into to hedge anticipated transactions have been designated as cashflow hedges as of june 30 2005 these cashflow hedges were highly effective in all material respects 

  

  

as a matter of policy we only enter into contracts with counterparties that have at least an “a” or equivalent credit rating the counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions we do not have significant exposure to any one counterparty our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to only the recognized but not realized gains attributable to the contracts management believes risk of default under these hedging contracts is remote and in any event would not be material to the consolidated financial results the contracts have varying maturities through the end of june 2006 costs associated with entering into such contracts have not been material to our consolidated financial results we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes at june 30 2005 we had foreign currency contracts in the form of forward exchange contracts and option contracts in the amount of 6675 million and 1209 million respectively the foreign currencies included in forward exchange contracts notional value stated in us dollars are principally the swiss franc 1286 million british pound 1276 million euro 1233 million canadian dollar 781 million australian dollar 433 million japanese yen 316 million and south korean won 276 million the foreign currencies included in the option contracts notional value stated in us dollars are principally the japanese yen 336 million south korean won 263 million euro 215 million and swiss franc 203 million 

  

interest rate risk management 

we enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the exposure to fluctuations of interest rates on our funded and unfunded indebtedness for periods consistent with the identified exposures all interest rate derivative contracts are with large financial institutions rated as strong investment grade by a major rating agency 

  

we have an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 2500 million to effectively convert fixed interest on the existing 2500 million 6 senior notes to variable interest rates based on sixmonth libor we designated the swap as a fairvalue hedge as of june 30 2005 the fairvalue hedge was highly effective in all material respects 

  

market risk 

we use a valueatrisk model to assess the market risk of our derivative financial instruments valueatrisk represents the potential losses for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors for a specified time period and confidence level we estimate valueatrisk across all of our derivative financial instruments using a model with historical volatilities and correlations calculated over the past 250day period the measured valueatrisk calculated as an average for the twelve months ended june 30 2005 related to our foreign exchange contracts and our interest rate contracts was 68 million and 112 million respectively   the model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 percent confidence level we used a statistical simulation model that valued our derivative financial instruments against one thousand randomly generated market price paths 

  

our calculated valueatrisk exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may or may not occur it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated based upon actual fluctuations in market rates operating exposures and the timing thereof and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year 

  

we believe however that any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the derivative financial instrument was intended 

  

  

offbalance sheet arrangements

recently issued accounting standards 

  

in june 2005 the emerging issues task force “eitf” reached a consensus on issue no 056 “determining the amortization period for leasehold improvements” this issue addresses the amortization period for leasehold improvements in operating leases that are either a placed in service significantly after and not contemplated at or near the beginning of the initial lease term or b acquired in a business combination leasehold improvements that are placed in service significantly after and not contemplated at or near the beginning of the lease term should be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewals that are deemed to be reasonably assured at the date the leasehold improvements are purchased leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination should be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewals that are deemed to be reasonably assured at the date of acquisition this issue shall be applied to leasehold improvements that are purchased or acquired in reporting periods after june 29 2005 and we do not expect this issue to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in june 2005 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued fasb staff position “fsp” fas 1431 “accounting for electronic equipment waste obligations” to address the accounting for electronic equipment waste obligations associated with directive 200296ec on waste electrical and electronic equipment the “directive” adopted by the european union “eu” the directive effectively obligates a commercial user to incur costs associated with the retirement of a specified asset that qualifies as historical waste equipment as defined in the directive commercial users of electronic equipment should apply the provisions of sfas no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” “sfas no 143” and the related fasb interpretation no 47 “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations” to the obligation associated with historical waste since this type of obligation is an asset retirement obligation the initial recognition of an assetretirementcost liability shall be recorded as an equal and offsetting increase in the carrying amount of the related asset subsequent adjustments to the initial measurement of the asset and liability shall also be made in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 143 the guidance in this fsp shall be applied the later of the first reporting period ending after june 8 2005 or the date of the adoption of the law by the applicable eumember country we are currently evaluating the impact this fsp will have on our consolidated financial statements if any 

  

in may 2005 the fasb issued sfas no 154 “accounting changes and error corrections” “sfas no 154” which establishes unless impracticable retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to the newly adopted accounting principle the statement provides guidance for determining whether retrospective application of a change in accounting principle is impracticable the statement also addresses the reporting of a correction of an error by restating previously issued financial statements sfas no 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 we will adopt this statement as required and we do not believe the adoption will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

  

on december 21 2004 the fasb issued fsp fas 1091 “application of fasb statement no 109 accounting for income taxes to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of 2004” “fsp no 1091” and fsp fas 1092 “accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of 2004” “fsp no 1092” these staff positions provide accounting guidance on how companies should account for the effects of the ajca that was signed into law on october 22 2004 

  

fsp no 1091 states that the tax relief special tax deduction for domestic manufacturing from this legislation should be accounted for as a “special deduction” instead of a tax rate reduction the special deduction for domestic manufacturing becomes effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 we believe this legislation and the provisions of fsp no 1091 will not have a significant impact on our effective tax rate 

  

fsp no 1092 gives a company additional time to evaluate the effects of the legislation on any plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying fasb statement no 109 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 we formulated a plan to repatriate approximately 690 million of foreign earnings in fiscal 2006 which includes 500 million of extraordinary intercompany dividends under the provisions of the ajca this action resulted in an aggregate tax charge of approximately 35 million which included an incremental tax charge of approximately 28 million in fiscal 2005 the overall effective rate for income taxes increased from 377 for fiscal 2004 to 412 for fiscal 2005 primarily as a result of the repatriation plan 

  

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” “sfas no 123r” this statement replaces sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” sfas no 123r requires all stockbased compensation to be recognized as an expense in the financial statements and that such cost be measured according to the fair value of the award sfas no 123r will be effective for our first quarter of fiscal 2006 while we currently provide the pro forma disclosures required by sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation – transition and disclosure” on a quarterly basis see note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements–stockbased compensation we are currently evaluating the impact this statement will have on our consolidated financial statements in march 2005 staff accounting bulletin no 107 “sab no 107” was issued to provide guidance from the securities and exchange commission to simplify some of the implementation challenges of sfas no 123r as this statement relates to the valuation of sharebased payment arrangements for public companies we will apply the principles of sab no 107 in connection with our adoption of sfas no 123r 

  

in november 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 151 “inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4” “sfas no 151” sfas no 151 requires all companies to recognize a currentperiod charge for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted materials this statement also requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities sfas no 151 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 we believe the adoption of this statement will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

marketing 

  

our marketing strategy is built around our vision statement “bringing the best to everyone we touch” mrs estée lauder formulated this marketing philosophy to provide highquality service and products as the foundation for a solid and loyal consumer base 

  

our marketing efforts focus principally on promoting the quality and benefits of our products each of our brands is distinctively positioned has a single global image and is promoted with consistent logos packaging and advertising designed to enhance its image and differentiate it from other brands we regularly advertise our products on television and radio in upscale magazines and prestigious newspapers and through direct mail and photo displays at international airports in addition our products receive extensive editorial coverage in prestige publications and other media worldwide promotional activities and instore displays are designed to introduce existing consumers to different products in the line and to attract new consumers our marketing efforts also benefit from cooperative advertising programs with retailers some of which are supported by coordinated promotions such as purchase with purchase and gift with purchase at instore counters sales representatives offer personal demonstrations to market individual products as well as to provide education on basic skin care and makeup application we conduct extensive sampling programs and we pioneered gift with purchase as a sampling program we believe that the quality and perceived benefits of sample products have been effective inducements to purchases by new and existing consumers 

  

starting with the launch of the clinique website in 1996 we have used the internet to educate and inform consumers about certain of our brands currently we have sixteen singlebrand marketing sites eight of which have ecommerce capabilities and glosscom our majorityowned multibrand marketing and ecommerce site 

  

most of our creative marketing work is done by inhouse creative teams the creative staff designs and produces the sales materials advertisements and packaging for all products in each brand total advertising and promotional expenditures were 16120 million 14161 million and 13174 million for fiscal 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively these amounts include expenses relating to purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions that are reflected in net sales and cost of sales 

  

our marketing and sales executives spend considerable time in the field meeting with consumers and key retailers and consulting with sales representatives at the points of sale these include estée lauder beauty advisors clinique consultants aramis selling specialists prescriptives analysts origins guides and m ž a ž c makeup artists

  

management information systems 

  

management information systems support business processes including product development marketing sales order processing production distribution and finance of the many systems currently being utilized the most significant to our business needs are i a centralized data repository of essential attributes for each of the products we offer or plan to offer which enables us to globally manufacture and market products of consistent quality ii a sales analysis system to track weekly sales at the stock keeping unit sku level at most significant retail sales locations ie sellthrough data increasing our understanding of consumer preferences and enabling us to coordinate more effectively our product development manufacturing and marketing strategies iii an automated replenishment system with many of our key domestic customers allowing us to replenish inventories for individual points of sale automatically with minimal paperwork and iv an inventory management system to provide us with a global view of finished goods availability relative to actual requirements resulting in improved inventory control and distribution for both existing product lines and new product launches 

  

the efficiencies provided by these systems have resulted in increased sales fewer outofstocks and reduced retail inventories we expect that these systems will continue to provide inventory and sales efficiencies in the short and medium terms 

  

as part of our ongoing effort to enhance these efficiencies we are evaluating enterprisewide global programs that could deliver a single set of integrated data processes and technologies which would be scalable and used to standardize business processes across brands operating units and sales affiliates 

  

  

research and development 

  

we believe that we are an industry leader in the development of new products marketing product development and packaging groups work with our research and development group to identify shifts in consumer preferences develop new products and redesign or reformulate existing products in addition research and development personnel work closely with quality assurance and manufacturing personnel on a worldwide basis to ensure consistent global standards for our products and to deliver products with attributes that fulfill consumer expectations 

  

we maintain ongoing research and development programs at our facilities in melville new york oevel belgium tokyo japan markham ontario blaine minnesota and colombes france as of june 30 2004 we had approximately 400 employees engaged in research and development research and development expenditures totaled 672 million 608 million and 613 million in fiscal 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively our research and development group makes significant contributions toward improving existing products and developing new products and provides ongoing technical assistance and knowhow to our manufacturing activities the research and development group has had longstanding working relationships with several us and international medical and educational facilities which supplement internal capabilities we do not conduct animal testing of our products 

  

manufacturing and raw materials 

  

we manufacture skin care makeup fragrance and hair care products in the united states belgium switzerland the united kingdom canada and france we continue to streamline our manufacturing processes and identify sourcing opportunities to improve innovation increase efficiencies and reduce costs our major manufacturing facilities operate as “focus” plants that primarily manufacture one type of product eg lipsticks for all of the principal brands our plants are modern and our manufacturing processes are substantially automated while we believe that our manufacturing facilities are sufficient to meet current and reasonably anticipated manufacturing requirements we continue to identify opportunities to make significant improvements in capacity and productivity to capitalize on innovation and other supply benefits we continue to utilize third parties on a global basis for finished goods production 

  

the principal raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are essential oils alcohol and specialty chemicals we also purchase packaging components that are manufactured to our design specifications procurement of materials for all manufacturing facilities is generally made on a global basis through our centralized supplier relations department a concentrated effort in supplier rationalization has been made with the specific objective of reducing costs increasing innovation and improving quality as a result of sourcing initiatives there is increased dependency on certain suppliers but we believe that these suppliers have adequate resources and facilities to overcome any unforeseen interruption of supply we are continually benchmarking the performance of the supply chain and will add or delete suppliers based upon the changing needs of the business we have in the past been able to obtain an adequate supply of essential raw materials and currently believe we have adequate sources of supply for virtually all components of our products as we integrate acquired brands we continually seek new ways to leverage our production and sourcing capabilities to improve manufacturing performance 

  

  

competition 

  

the skin care makeup fragrance and hair care businesses are characterized by vigorous competition throughout the world brand recognition quality performance and price have a significant influence on consumers’ choices among competing products and brands advertising promotion merchandising the pace and timing of new product introductions line extensions and the quality of instore sales staff also have a significant impact on consumers’ buying decisions we compete against a number of manufacturers and marketers of skin care makeup fragrance and hair care products some of which have substantially greater resources than we do

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements these judgments can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition concentration of credit risk inventory pension and other postretirement benefit costs goodwill and other intangible assets income taxes and derivatives 

  

revenue recognition 

generally revenues from merchandise sales are recorded at the time the product is shipped to the customer we report our sales levels on a net sales basis which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual returns received and an amount established for anticipated returns 

  

as is customary in the cosmetics industry our practice is to accept returns of our products from retailers if properly requested authorized and approved in accepting returns we typically provide a credit to the retailer against sales and accounts receivable from that retailer on a dollarfordollar basis 

  

our sales return accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net sales this accrual is calculated based on a history of gross sales and actual returns by region and product category in addition as necessary specific accruals may be established for future known or anticipated events as a percentage of gross sales sales returns were 46 51 and 48 in fiscal 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively 

  

  

concentration of credit risk 

an entity is vulnerable to concentration of credit risk if it is exposed to risks of loss greater than it would have had it mitigated its risks through diversification of customers the significance of such credit risk depends on the extent and nature of the concentration 

  

we have three major customers that owned and operated retail stores that in the aggregate accounted for 12538 million or 22 of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2004 and 1666 million or 25 of our accounts receivable at june 30 2004 these customers sell products primarily within north america although management believes that these customers are sound and creditworthy a severe adverse impact on their business operations could have a corresponding material adverse effect on our net sales cash flows andor financial condition 

  

in the ordinary course of business we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions in the amount of 301 million and 318 million as of june 30 2004 and 2003 respectively our allowance for doubtful accounts is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net earnings the allowance for doubtful accounts was reduced by 256 million 303 million and 248 million for customer deductions and writeoffs in fiscal 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively and increased by 239 million 315 million and 286 million for additional provisions in fiscal 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively this reserve is based upon the evaluation of accounts receivable aging specific exposures and historical trends 

  

inventory 

we state our inventory at the lower of cost or fair market value with cost being determined on the firstin firstout fifo method we believe fifo most closely matches the flow of our products from manufacture through sale the reported net value of our inventory includes saleable products promotional products raw materials and componentry and work in process that will be sold or used in future periods inventory cost includes raw materials direct labor and overhead 

  

we also record an inventory obsolescence reserve which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value based on various product sales projections this reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales in addition and as necessary we may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events 

  

pension and other postretirement benefit costs 

we offer the following benefits to some or all of our employees a domestic trustbased noncontributory defined benefit pension plan “us plan” an unfunded nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations a contributory defined contribution plan international pension plans which vary by country consisting of both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans deferred compensation and certain other postretirement benefits 

  

the amounts necessary to fund future payouts under these plans are subject to numerous assumptions and variables certain significant variables require us to make assumptions that are within our control such as an anticipated discount rate expected rate of return on plan assets and future compensation levels we evaluate these assumptions with our actuarial advisors and we believe they are within accepted industry ranges although an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a direct impact on reported net earnings 

  

the preretirement discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated longterm bonds for fiscal 2004 we used a preretirement discount rate for our us plan of 575 and varying rates on our international plans of between 225 and 600 for fiscal 2004 we used an expected return on plan assets of 800 for our us plan and varying rates of between 325 and 750 for our international plans in determining the longterm rate of return for a plan we consider the historical rates of return the nature of the plan’s investments and an expectation for the plan’s investment strategies the us plan asset allocation as of june 30 2004 was approximately 63 equity investments 32 fixed income investments and 5 other investments 

  

for fiscal 2005 we will use a preretirement discount rate for the us plan of 600 and anticipate using an expected return on plan assets of 775 the net change in these assumptions from those used in fiscal 2004 will cause a de minimis decrease in pension expense in fiscal 2005 we will continue to monitor the market conditions relative to these assumptions and adjust them accordingly 

  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the value of their underlying net assets other intangible assets principally consist of purchased royalty rights and trademarks goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite life are not amortized 

  

  

on an annual basis we test goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment to determine the fair value of these intangible assets there are many assumptions and estimates used that directly impact the results of the testing we have the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose to mitigate undue influence we use industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management 

  

income taxes 

we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 109 “accounting for income taxes” this statement establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effects of income taxes that result from an enterprise’s activities during the current and preceding years it requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes 

  

as of june 30 2004 we have current net deferred tax assets of 1459 million and noncurrent net deferred tax liabilities of 268 million the net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization as well as the continued application of currently anticipated tax rates included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance of approximately 42 million for deferred tax assets which relates to foreign tax loss carryforwards not utilized to date where management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the relevant jurisdiction based on our assessments no additional valuation allowance is required if we determine that a deferred tax asset will not be realizable an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will result in a reduction of earnings at that time 

  

furthermore we provide tax reserves for federal state and international exposures relating to audit results planning initiatives and compliance responsibilities the development of these reserves requires judgments about tax issues potential outcomes and timing and is a subjective critical estimate 

  

derivatives 

we account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” as amended which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities this statement also requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and that they be measured at fair value 

  

we currently use derivative financial instruments to hedge certain anticipated transactions and interest rates as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies we do not utilize derivatives for trading or speculative purposes hedge effectiveness is documented assessed and monitored by employees who are qualified to make such assessments and monitor the instruments variables that are external to us such as social political and economic risks may have an impact on our hedging program and the results thereof

reconciliations of financial results 

  

the following tables present reconciliations of our financial results for the fiscal years ended june 30 2003 and 2002 as reported in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” and those results adjusted to exclude certain charges described above each table we have presented these reconciliations because of the special nature of the charges or the fact that they are not necessarily comparable from period to period we believe that such measures provide investors with a view of our ongoing business trends and results of continuing operations this is consistent with the approach used by management in its evaluation and monitoring of such trends and results and provides investors with a base for evaluating future periods there were no events or transactions in fiscal 2004 for which we believe such a presentation would be relevant

fiscal 2004 as compared with fiscal 2003 

  

net sales 

  

net sales increased 14 or 6944 million to 57904 million reflecting growth in all product categories and all geographic regions led by doubledigit growth in europe the middle east  africa and asiapacific and the inclusion of a full year of net sales of the darphin line of products which was acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 net sales results in europe the middle east  africa and asiapacific benefited from the weakening of the us dollar excluding the impact of foreign currency translation net sales increased 9 

  

product categories 

  

skin care 

net sales of skin care products increased 13 or 2464 million to 21401 million this increase was primarily attributable to the recent launches of hydra complete multilevel moisture cream and idealist microd deep thermal refinisher by estée lauder and pore minimizer by clinique additionally the increase was supported by strong sales of clinique’s 3step skin care system and the repairwear line of products from clinique as well as renutriv intensive lift serum and renutriv intensive eye crème by estée lauder also contributing to this increase was the inclusion of a full year of net sales of the darphin line of products which are primarily skin care and growth in developing brands partially offsetting these increases were lower net sales of certain existing products such as advanced stop signs by clinique and white light and lightsource product lines by estée lauder excluding the impact of foreign currency translation skin care net sales increased 8 

  

makeup 

makeup net sales increased 14 or 2605 million to 21483 million in part due to strong sales of our m ž a ž c and bobbi brown makeup artist lines the increase in net sales also reflected the current year launches of ideal matte refinishing makeup spf 8 and electric intense lipcreme by estée lauder and perfectly real makeup and colour surge bare brilliance by clinique also contributing to net sales growth were strong sales of high impact mascara high impact eye shadow and skin clarifying makeup by clinique as well as pure color lip vinyl and artist’s lip and eye pencils from estée lauder partially offsetting these increases were lower net sales of certain existing products such as so ingenious multidimension liquid makeup and pure color lipstick from estée lauder and moisture surge lipstick from clinique excluding the impact of foreign currency translation makeup net sales increased 10

  

fragrance 

net sales of fragrance products increased 15 or 1615 million to 12211 million primarily attributable to the current year launches of estée lauder beyond paradise aramis life clinique simply and the tommy jeans collection these product launches primarily contributed to increased fragrance net sales outside the united states additionally the increase in net sales benefited from improved results from our travel retail business these net sales increases were partially offset by lower net sales of estée lauder pleasures  intuition and beautiful certain tommy hilfiger products and clinique happy excluding the impact of foreign currency translation fragrance net sales increased 10 

  

hair care 

hair care net sales increased 9 or 205 million to 2494 million this increase was primarily the result of sales growth from aveda and bumble and bumble products due to an increase in sales at existing salons and spas new salon and spa openings and the success of new and existing products aveda net sales also increased as a result of the opening of new companyowned aveda experience centers partially offsetting the increase were lower net sales of clinique’s simple hair care system excluding the impact of foreign currency translation hair care net sales increased 7 

  

the introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products which we take into account in our business planning 

  

geographic regions 

net sales in the americas increased 7 or 2170 million to 31488 million primarily reflecting growth from our newer brands the success of new and recently launched products and increases from most of the company’s freestanding retail stores all of which reflected the strengthening retail environment nevertheless the prestige fragrance business in the united states continues to be challenging 

  

  

in europe the middle east  africa net sales increased 24 or 3638 million to 18702 million primarily reflecting higher net sales from our travel retail business the united kingdom spain greece and south africa as well as the inclusion of a full year of net sales of the darphin line of products we also benefited from the effect of favorable foreign currency exchange rates to the us dollar excluding the impact of foreign currency translation net sales in europe the middle east  africa increased 14 

  

net sales in asiapacific increased 17 or 1136 million to 7714 million primarily due to higher net sales in japan australia taiwan china and thailand excluding the impact of foreign currency translation net sales in asiapacific increased 9 

  

we strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market which may account for differences in regional sales growth 

  

cost of sales 

  

cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales improved to 255 from 260 reflecting production and supply chain efficiencies of approximately 70 basis points and lower costs from promotional activities of approximately 60 basis points partially offsetting these improvements were changes in exchange rates of approximately 40 basis points and costs related to inventory obsolescence and reconditioning and rehandling of goods of approximately 20 basis points also offsetting these improvements were costs associated with higher travel retail sales which contributed approximately 10 basis points travel retail has a higher cost of goods sold percentage because of its higher mix of fragrance sales coupled with its margin structure 

  

since certain promotional activities are a component of sales or cost of sales and the timing and level of promotions vary with our promotional calendar we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in the cost of sales percentage in addition future cost of sales mix may be impacted by the inclusion of new brands which have margin and product cost structures different than our existing brands 

  

operating expenses 

  

operating expenses decreased to 634 of net sales as compared with 641 of net sales in the prior year prioryear operating expenses included a charge related to the pending settlement of a legal proceeding of 220 million or 04 of net sales before considering the effect of this charge operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points from 637 in the prior year operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased approximately 100 basis points primarily due to the higher growth rate in net sales particularly in the travel retail business as well as our ongoing cost containment efforts to maintain expenses in line with our business needs partially offset by operating expenses related to beautybank the higher operating costs associated with newly acquired brands and expenses related to compliance with new regulatory requirements such as those arising under the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 partially offsetting the net favorability in the current year were higher levels of advertising merchandising and sampling expenses incurred to support new and recently launched products of approximately 70 basis points 

  

changes in advertising sampling and merchandising spending result from the type timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts as well as the markets being emphasized 

  

under agreements covering our purchase of trademarks for a percentage of related sales royalty payments totaling 188 million and 203 million in fiscal 2004 and 2003 respectively have been charged to expense such payments were made to mrs estée lauder until her death on april 24 2004 after which time the final payments ceased to accrue and were made to a trust this event resulted in a reduction of operating expenses in fiscal 2004 of 37 million or 22 million after tax we will realize a benefit from the elimination of these royalty payments in fiscal 2005 

  

operating results 

  

operating income increased 28 or 1403 million to 6440 million operating margins were 111 of net sales in the current period as compared with 99 in the prior year prior year results include a charge related to the pending settlement of a legal proceeding of 220 million absent this charge operating income increased 23 or 1183 million and operating margins increased 80 basis points from fiscal 2003 these increases in operating income and operating margin reflect sales growth improvements in the components of cost of sales and a reduction in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales 

  

  

net earnings and net earnings per diluted share increased approximately 7 and 17 respectively net earnings improved 223 million to 3421 million and net earnings per diluted share increased by 17 from 126 to 148 net earnings from continuing operations increased by 498 million or 15 and diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations increased 26 to 162 from 129 in the prior year absent the charge related to the pending settlement of a legal proceeding net earnings from continuing operations increased by 363 million or 11 and diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations increased 21 from 135 

  

the following discussions of operating results by product categories and geographic regions exclude the impact of the fiscal 2003 charge related to the pending settlement of a legal proceeding we believe the following analysis of operating income better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business the table on page 22 reconciles these results to operating income as reported in the consolidated statements of earnings

interest expense net 

  

net interest expense was 271 million as compared with 81 million in the prior year the increase in net interest expense was due to the inclusion of the dividends on redeemable preferred stock of 174 million as interest expense in fiscal 2004 this change in reporting resulted from a change in accounting standards which prohibits us from restating the prior fiscal year results see “recently issued accounting standards” to a lesser extent interest expense was also affected by higher average net borrowings and a marginally higher effective interest rate on our debt portfolio in fiscal 2005 we expect a reduction in interest expense as a result of the partial redemption of preferred stock and the lower dividend rate on the remaining preferred stock compared to fiscal 2004 see “liquidity and capital resources” for further details 

  

provision for income taxes 

  

the provision for income taxes represents federal foreign state and local income taxes the effective rate for income taxes for fiscal 2004 was 377 as compared with 329 in the prior year these rates differ from statutory rates reflecting the effect of state and local taxes tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and certain nondeductible expenses the increase in the effective income tax rate was attributable to the inclusion of the dividends on redeemable preferred stock as interest expense which are not deductible for income tax purposes the mix of global earnings and to a lesser extent the timing of certain tax planning initiatives the prior year rate included benefits derived from certain favorable tax negotiations

the introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products which we take into account in our business planning 

  

geographic regions

we strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market which may account for differences in regional sales growth 

  

  

cost of sales 

  

cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales improved to 260 from 268 reflecting production and supply chain efficiencies and lower costs from promotional activities 

  

we continued to emphasize sourcing initiatives and overall supply chain management which resulted in lower manufacturing costs whereas in the prior year we experienced underabsorption of overhead as a result of the impact of the events of september 11 2001 

  

the inclusion of promotional merchandise as a component of cost of sales results in lower margins a strategic shift to reduce these activities in fiscal 2003 contributed to the improvement in our gross profit margin for the year the inclusion of the cost of purchase with purchase and gift with purchase merchandise as a component of cost of sales resulted from our adoption of eitf issue no 019 since the cost of these promotional activities is a component of cost of sales and the timing and level of promotions vary with our promotional calendar we experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in the cost of sales percentage 

  

operating expenses 

  

operating expenses decreased to 641 of net sales as compared with 660 of net sales in the prioryear period the fiscal 2003 results were impacted by a charge related to the pending settlement of a legal proceeding of 220 million or 04 of net sales fiscal 2002 operating expenses included a restructuring charge of 1096 million or 23 of net sales before considering the effect of these two charges operating expenses increased slightly to 637 of net sales compared with 636 of net sales in the prior year the increase in spending primarily related to advertising sampling and merchandising activities particularly during the early portion of fiscal 2003 excluding purchase with purchase and gift with purchase activities discussed as a component of cost of sales which supported our sales growth and built momentum going into the second half of fiscal 2003 changes in advertising sampling and merchandising spending result from the type timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts as well as the markets being emphasized

the following discussions of operating results by product categories and geographic regions exclude the impact of the fiscal 2003 charge related to the pending settlement of a legal proceeding and the fiscal 2002 restructuring we believe the following analysis of operating income better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business the tables on page 22 reconcile these results to operating income as reported in the consolidated statements of earnings 

  

product categories 

operating income more than doubled to 321 million in fragrance due primarily to improved results from our travel retail business operating income increased 10 to 2732 million in skin care and 13 to 2066 million in makeup reflecting higher net sales partially offset by strategic spending on advertising sampling and merchandising particularly in the earlier portion of fiscal 2003 operating income increased 11 million or 8 to 148 million in hair care reflecting improvements in aveda and bumble and bumble as well as higher profits in the latter portion of the year outside the united states 

  

  

geographic regions

interest expense net 

  

net interest expense was 81 million as compared with 98 million in fiscal 2002 the decrease in net interest expense was primarily due to lower outstanding net borrowings and higher interest income generated by higher invested cash balances this improvement was partially offset by a higher effective interest rate which resulted from the increased proportion of fixed rate debt as compared with variable rate debt in the prior year in may 2003 we executed a fixedtofloating interest rate swap on our 2500 million 6 senior notes due 2012 see “liquidity and capital resources” for further details 

  

provision for income taxes 

  

the provision for income taxes represents federal foreign state and local income taxes the effective rate for income taxes for fiscal 2003 was 329 as compared with 345 in fiscal 2002 these rates differ from statutory rates reflecting the effect of state and local taxes tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and certain nondeductible expenses the decrease in the effective tax rate was principally attributable to ongoing tax planning initiatives including the favorable settlement of certain tax negotiations and the reduction of the overall tax rate relating to the company’s foreign operations in addition the tax effect of the charge related to the pending settlement of a legal proceeding in late fiscal 2003 contributed to an effective tax rate slightly lower than previously expected 

  

financial condition 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations and borrowings under commercial paper borrowings from the issuance of longterm debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks in the united states and abroad at june 30 2004 we had cash and cash equivalents of 6116 million compared with 3641 million at june 30 2003 

  

at june 30 2004 our outstanding borrowings of 5353 million included i 2366 million of 6 senior notes due january 2012 consisting of 2500 million principal unamortized debt discount of 09 million and a 125 million adjustment to reflect the fair value of an outstanding interest rate swap ii 1973 million of 575 senior notes due october 2033 consisting of 2000 million principal and unamortized debt discount of 27 million iii 684 million of cumulative redeemable preferred stock which shares have a mandatory redemption date of june 30 2015 see “recently issued accounting standards” iv a 30 billion yen term loan approximately 276 million at exchange rates as of june 30 2004 which is due in march 2006 and v 54 million of other shortterm borrowings 

  

in september 2003 we issued and sold 2000 million of 575 senior notes due october 2033 “575 senior notes” in a public offering the 575 senior notes were priced at 98645 with a yield of 5846 interest payments which commenced april 15 2004 will be made semiannually on april 15 and october 15 of each year in may 2003 in anticipation of the issuance of the 575 senior notes we entered into a series of treasury lock agreements on a notional amount totaling 1950 million at a weighted average allin rate of 453 the treasury lock agreements were settled upon the issuance of the new debt and we received a payment of 150 million that will be amortized against interest expense over the life of the 575 senior notes as a result of the treasury lock agreements the debt discount and debt issuance costs our effective interest rate on the 575 senior notes will be 5395 over the life of the debt we issued these fixedrate notes to lock in longterm liquidity at historically low prevailing market rates and to mitigate future interest rate volatility 

  

  

on december 31 2003 we and the holders of the 650 cumulative redeemable preferred stock exchanged all of the outstanding shares of 650 cumulative redeemable preferred stock due june 30 2005 for a newly issued series of cumulative redeemable preferred stock with a mandatory redemption date of june 30 2015 “2015 preferred stock” for the quarters ended december 31 2003 and march 31 2004 the dividend rate on the 2015 preferred stock was 475 per annum payable quarterly 

  

on april 24 2004 mrs estée lauder passed away as a result our right to call for redemption 2916 million of the 2015 preferred stock became exercisable and the holders’ right to put to us all 3600 million aggregate principal amount of the 2015 preferred stock became exercisable 

  

on june 10 2004 we redeemed for cash all 2916 million aggregate principal amount of 2015 preferred stock that could be redeemed at that time upon this partial redemption the dividend rate on the remaining 684 million principal amount of 2015 preferred stock was reduced for the period from april 25 2004 through june 30 2004 from 475 per annum to 062 per annum which is a rate based on the aftertax yield on sixmonth us treasuries so long as the remaining shares of 2015 preferred stock are outstanding the dividend rate will be reset semiannually in january and july at the thenexisting aftertax yield on sixmonth us treasuries the dividend rate for the sixmonth period from july 1 2004 through december 31 2004 is 0994 as a result of the redemption of the 2916 million principal amount of 2015 preferred stock and the reduction of the dividend rate on the remaining 684 million principal amount of 2015 preferred stock we expect to save net of financing costs approximately 140 million in fiscal 2005 

  

the remaining 684 million principal amount of 2015 preferred stock may be put to us at any time at face value but may not be redeemed by us until may 24 2005 if put to us on or before june 30 2005 we would have up to 120 days after the exercise date of the put to pay for the shares if the remaining shares of 2015 preferred stock are put to us or if we call those shares for redemption we expect to use cash on hand to fund the redemption 

  

we have a 7500 million commercial paper program under which we may issue commercial paper in the united states our commercial paper is currently rated a1 by standard  poor’s and p1 by moody’s our longterm credit ratings are a with a negative outlook by standard  poor’s and a1 with a stable outlook by moody’s at june 30 2004 we had no commercial paper outstanding we also have an effective shelf registration statement covering the potential issuance of up to an additional 3000 million in debt securities as of june 30 2004 we had an unused 4000 million revolving credit facility expiring on june 28 2006 and 1733 million in additional uncommitted credit facilities of which 54 million was used 

  

our business is seasonal in nature and accordingly our working capital needs vary from time to time we may enter into investing and financing transactions that require additional funding to the extent that these needs exceed cash from operations we could subject to market conditions issue commercial paper issue longterm debt securities or borrow under the revolving credit facility 

  

total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 24 at june 30 2004 as compared with 14 at june 30 2003 this increase primarily reflects the classification of the 2015 preferred stock as shortterm debt as well as the issuance of the 575 senior notes in fiscal 2004 

  

the effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years generally we have been able to introduce new products at higher selling prices or increase selling prices sufficiently to offset cost increases which have been moderate 

  

we believe that cash on hand cash generated from operations available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business operations and capital expenditures on both a nearterm and longterm basis 

  

  

cash flows 

net cash provided by operating activities was 6698 million in fiscal 2004 as compared with 5531 million in fiscal 2003 and 5193 million in fiscal 2002 the improved operating cash flow primarily reflects increased net earnings from continuing operations and an increase in accrued costs changes in operating assets and liabilities reflect partially offsetting increases in accounts payable and inventory in anticipation of product launches in fiscal 2005 higher accounts receivable in line with sales growth and changes in other assets and accrued liabilities that reflect receipts and accruals from employee compensation and benefit related transactions as well as selling advertising and merchandising activities we expect cash flows from operations in fiscal 2005 to reflect payments of approximately 47 million net of tax related to deferred compensation and supplemental pension arrangements the improvement in net cash flows for fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 reflected increased earnings and seasonal levels of operating assets and liabilities operating assets and liabilities reflected an improvement in accounts receivable collections in fiscal 2003 and a higher level of accounts payable partially offset by increased inventories at june 30 2003 in anticipation of product launches in the first half of fiscal 2004 and the impact of acquisitions on required inventory levels 

  

net cash used for investing activities was 2080 million in fiscal 2004 compared with 1925 million in fiscal 2003 and 2170 million in fiscal 2002 net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2004 primarily related to capital expenditures net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2003 primarily related to capital expenditures and the acquisition of darphin and certain aveda distributors net cash used in fiscal 2002 related primarily to capital expenditures 

  

capital expenditures amounted to 2065 million 1631 million and 2032 million in fiscal 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively spending in all three years primarily reflected the continued upgrade of manufacturing equipment dies and molds new store openings store improvements counter construction and information technology enhancements in fiscal 2005 we expect our capital expenditures to increase as a result of a companywide initiative to upgrade our financial systems as well as our plan to invest in leasehold improvements in our corporate offices the reduced level of capital expenditures in fiscal 2003 reflected tight control on our spending in light of thenprevailing economic conditions fewer retail store openings and reduced spending related to leasehold improvements 

  

cash used for financing activities was 2160 million 5550 million and 1231 million in fiscal 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the net cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2004 primarily related to the redemption of 2916 million aggregate principal amount of the 2015 preferred stock common stock repurchases and dividend payments partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of the 575 senior notes and employee stock transactions net cash used for financing during fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 primarily related to common stock repurchases the repayment of longterm debt and dividend payments 

  

dividends 

on november 5 2003 the board of directors declared an annual dividend of 30 per share on our class a and class b common stock payable on january 6 2004 to stockholders of record at the close of business on december 16 2003 common stock dividends paid during the fiscal years 2004 2003 and 2002 were 685 million 583 million and 476 million respectively dividends paid on the preferred stock were 174 million for the year ended june 30 2004 and 234 million for the years ended june 30 2003 and 2002 the decrease reflects an agreement to reduce the dividend of the preferred stock made in connection with the exchange of the preferred shares on december 31 2003 and the redemption of 2916 million aggregate principal amount of 2015 preferred stock on june 10 2004 the dividend rate on the remaining 684 million principal amount of 2015 preferred stock was reduced for the period from april 25 2004 through june 30 2004 from 475 per annum to 062 per annum which is a rate based on the aftertax yield on sixmonth us treasuries the dividend rate for the sixmonth period july 1 2004 through december 31 2004 is 0994 so long as the remaining shares of 2015 preferred stock are outstanding the dividend rate will be reset semiannually in january and july at the then existing aftertax yield on sixmonth us treasuries the cumulative redeemable preferred stock dividends declared for the year ended june 30 2004 have been characterized as interest expense see “recently issued accounting standards” 

  

pension plan funding and expense 

we maintain pension plans covering substantially all of our fulltime employees for our us operations and a majority of our international operations several plans provide pension benefits based primarily on years of service and employees’ earnings in the united states we maintain a trustbased noncontributory defined benefit pension plan “us plan” additionally we have an unfunded nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations our international pension plans are comprised of defined benefit and defined contribution plans 

  

  

several factors influence our annual funding requirements for the us plan our funding policy consists of annual contributions at a rate that provides for future plan benefits and maintains appropriate funded percentages such contribution is not less than the minimum required by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended “erisa” and subsequent pension legislation and is not more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes for each international plan our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations in addition amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions as detailed in “critical accounting polices and estimates” the effect on operating results in the future of pension plan funding will depend on economic conditions employee demographics mortality rates the number of participants electing to take lumpsum distributions investment performance and funding decisions 

  

for fiscal 2004 and 2003 there was no minimum contribution to the us plan required by erisa however at management’s discretion we made cash contributions to the us plan of 330 million and 760 million during fiscal 2004 and 2003 respectively depending upon market conditions during fiscal 2005 we expect to make cash contributions to our us plan of 160 million 

  

in addition at june 30 2004 and 2003 we recognized a liability on our balance sheet for each pension plan if the fair market value of the assets of that plan was less than the accumulated benefit obligation and accordingly a benefit or a charge was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders’ equity during fiscal 2004 we recorded a benefit net of deferred tax of 160 million while in fiscal 2003 we recorded a charge net of deferred tax of 203 million to accumulated other comprehensive income loss 

  

commitments and contingencies 

on june 10 2004 we redeemed all 2916 million aggregate principal amount of 2015 preferred stock that could be redeemed at that time the remaining 684 million principal amount of 2015 preferred stock may be put to us at any time at face value but may not be redeemed by us until may 24 2005 if shares of the 2015 preferred stock are put to us on or before june 30 2005 we would have up to 120 days after notice to purchase such shares 

  

certain of our business acquisition agreements include “earnout” provisions these provisions generally require that we pay to the seller or sellers of the business additional amounts based on the performance of the acquired business the payments typically are made after a certain period of time and our next “earnout” payment is expected to be made after the end of fiscal 2005 since the size of each payment depends upon performance of the acquired business we do not expect that such payments will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or financial condition 

  

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes scheduled maturities of our contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed and determinable as of june 30 2004 

  

   

1   refer to notes 8 and 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements

2   includes operating lease commitments and to a lesser extent minimal capital lease commitments refer to note 15 of notes to consolidated financial statements

3   unconditional purchase obligations primarily include inventory commitments estimated future earnout payments estimated royalty payments pursuant to license agreements advertising commitments and capital improvement commitments

4   share units that were recorded as a component of stockholders’ equity as of june 30 2004 have been converted to the cash equivalent value and placed in a deferred compensation account in fiscal 2005 based on a decision of the compensation committee of the board of directors in august 2004

  

  

derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 

we address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments we primarily enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates we also enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the effects of fluctuating interest rates we categorize these instruments as entered into for purposes other than trading 

  

for each derivative contract entered into where we look to obtain special hedge accounting treatment we formally document the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item as well as its riskmanagement objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge this process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as fairvalue cashflow or foreigncurrency hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions we also formally assess both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items if it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective then we will be required to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively 

  

foreign exchange risk management 

we enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge anticipated transactions as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies for periods consistent with our identified exposures the purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on our costs and on the cash flows that we receive from foreign subsidiaries almost all foreign currency contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries and are with large financial institutions rated as strong investment grade by a major rating agency we also enter into foreign currency options to hedge anticipated transactions where there is a high probability that anticipated exposures will materialize the forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options entered into to hedge anticipated transactions have been designated as cashflow hedges as of june 30 2004 these cashflow hedges were highly effective in all material respects 

  

as a matter of policy we only enter into contracts with counterparties that have at least an “a” or equivalent credit rating the counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions we do not have significant exposure to any one counterparty our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to only the recognized but not realized gains attributable to the contracts management believes risk of default under these hedging contracts is remote and in any event would not be material to the consolidated financial results the contracts have varying maturities through the end of june 2005 costs associated with entering into such contracts have not been material to our consolidated financial results we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes at june 30 2004 we had foreign currency contracts in the form of forward exchange contracts and option contracts in the amount of 5936 million and 820 million respectively the foreign currencies included in forward exchange contracts notional value stated in us dollars are principally the euro 1226 million swiss franc 1171 million british pound 728 million japanese yen 667 million south korean won 420 million canadian dollar 417 million and australian dollar 337 million the foreign currencies included in the option contracts notional value stated in us dollars are principally the euro 341 million british pound 254 million and swiss franc 127 million 

  

interest rate risk management 

we enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the exposure to fluctuations of interest rates on our funded and unfunded indebtedness as well as cash investments for periods consistent with the identified exposures all interest rate derivative contracts are with large financial institutions rated as strong investment grade by a major rating agency 

  

we have an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 2500 million to effectively convert fixed interest on the existing 2500 million 6 senior notes to variable interest rates based on sixmonth libor we designated the swap as a fair value hedge as of june 30 2004 the fair value hedge was highly effective in all material respects 

  

additionally in may 2003 in connection with the anticipated issuance of debt we entered into a series of treasury lock agreements on a notional amount totaling 1950 million at a weighted average allin rate of 453 these treasury lock agreements were used to hedge the exposure to a possible rise in interest rates prior to the september 2003 issuance of debt the agreements were settled upon the issuance of the 2000 million of 575 senior notes and we realized a gain in other comprehensive income of 150 million that is currently being amortized against interest expense over the 30year life of the 575 senior notes 

  

  

market risk 

we use a valueatrisk model to assess the market risk of our derivative financial instruments valueatrisk represents the potential losses for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors for a specified time period and confidence level we estimate valueatrisk across all of our derivative financial instruments using a model with historical volatilities and correlations calculated over the past 250day period the measured valueatrisk calculated as an average for the twelve months ended june 30 2004 related to our foreign exchange contracts and our interest rate contracts was 95 million and 145 million respectively   the model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 percent confidence level we used a statistical simulation model that valued our derivative financial instruments against one thousand randomly generated market price paths 

  

our calculated valueatrisk exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may or may not occur it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated based upon actual fluctuations in market rates operating exposures and the timing thereof and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year 

  

we believe however that any loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the hedge is intended 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

we do not maintain any offbalance sheet arrangements transactions obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations 

  

recently issued accounting standards 

  

on may 19 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued fasb staff position no fas 1062 “accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003” “fsp no 1062” in response to a new law regarding prescription drug benefits under medicare “medicare part d” and a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d currently statement of financial accounting standard no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” “sfas no 106” requires that changes in relevant law be considered in current measurement of postretirement benefit costs fsp no 1062 will be effective for financial statements of companies for the first interim or annual period beginning after june 15 2004 we will adopt fsp no 1062 in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 and will recognize the impact of the new law under medicare part d which will not be material to our results of operations cash flows or financial condition therefore any measures of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation or the net periodic postretirement benefit cost as of and for the year ended june 30 2004 do not reflect the effects of the new law 

  

in december 2003 the fasb issued fasb interpretation number 46r “fin 46r” “consolidation of variable interest entities” fin 46r which modifies certain provisions and effective dates of fin 46 sets forth criteria to be used in determining whether an investment in a variable interest entity should be consolidated these provisions are based on the general premise that if a company controls another entity through interests other than voting interests that company should consolidate the controlled entity we have evaluated whether the provisions of fin 46r are applicable to our investments certain of which are currently accounted for by the equity method as well as other arrangements which may meet the criteria of the interpretation and believe that there are currently no material arrangements that meet the definition of a variable interest entity which would require consolidation 

  

in december 2003 the fasb revised statement of financial accounting standard no 132 revised 2003 “employers’ disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits” “sfas no 132 r” establishing additional annual disclosures about plan assets investment strategy measurement date plan obligations and cash flows in addition the revised standard established interim disclosure requirements related to the net periodic benefit cost recognized and contributions paid or expected to be paid during the current fiscal year the new annual disclosures are effective for financial statements of companies with fiscal years ending after december 15 2003 and the interimperiod disclosures are effective for interim periods beginning after december 15 2003 we adopted the interim disclosures for our fiscal quarter ended march 31 2004 and the annual disclosures for our fiscal year ending june 30 2004 the adoption of the revised sfas no 132 r had no impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

  

  

we have adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 150 “accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity” “sfas no 150” sfas no 150 established standards for classifying and measuring certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity among other things it specifically requires that mandatorily redeemable instruments such as redeemable preferred stock be classified as a liability initial and subsequent measurements of the instruments differ based on the characteristics of each instrument and as provided for in the statement based on the provisions of this statement we have classified the cumulative redeemable preferred stock as a liability and the related dividends thereon have been characterized as interest expense restatement of financial statements for earlier years presented was not permitted the adoption of this statement has resulted in the inclusion of the dividends on the preferred stock equal to 174 million for the year ended june 30 2004 as interest expense while the inclusion has impacted net earnings net earnings attributable to common stock and earnings per common share were unaffected given that the dividends are not deductible for income tax purposes the inclusion of the preferred stock dividends as an interest expense has caused an increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2004 the adoption of sfas no 150 had no impact on our financial condition

our products from retailers in accepting returns we typically provide a credit
to the retailer against sales and accounts receivable from that retailer on a
dollarfordollar basis in recognition of this practice and in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles we report sales levels on a net basis
which is computed by deducting the amount of actual returns received and an
amount established for anticipated returns from gross sales as a percent of

marketing

our marketing strategy is built around our vision statement bringing the best
to everyone we touch mrs estee lauder formulated this marketing philosophy to
provide highquality service and products as the foundation for a solid and
loyal consumer base

our marketing efforts focus principally on promoting the quality and benefits of
our products each of our brands is distinctively positioned has a single
global image and is promoted with consistent logos packaging and advertising
designed to enhance its image and differentiate it from other brands we
regularly advertise our products on television and radio in upscale magazines
and prestigious newspapers and through direct mail and photo displays at
international airports promotional activities and instore displays are
designed to introduce existing consumers to different products in the line and
to attract new consumers our marketing efforts also benefit from cooperative
advertising programs with retailers some of which are supported by coordinated
promotions such as purchase with purchase and gift with purchase at instore
counters sales representatives offer personal demonstrations to market
individual products as well as to provide education on basic skin care and
makeup application we conduct extensive sampling programs and we pioneered gift
with purchase as a sampling program we believe that the quality and perceived
benefits of sample products have been effective inducements to purchases by new
and existing consumers

starting with the launch of the clinique website in 1996 we have used the
internet to educate and inform consumers about certain of our brands currently
we have fourteen singlebrand marketing sites six of which have ecommerce
capabilities and glosscom our majorityowned multibrand marketing and
ecommerce site

most of our creative marketing work is done by inhouse creative teams the
creative staff designs and produces the sales materials advertisements and
packaging for all products in each brand total advertising and promotional
expenditures were 14256 million 13262 million and 12553 million for
fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively these amounts include expenses
relating to purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions that are
reflected in net sales and cost of sales in addition our products receive
extensive editorial coverage in prestige publications and other media worldwide

our marketing and sales executives spend considerable time in the field meeting
with consumers and key retailers and consulting with sales representatives at
the points of sale these include estee lauder beauty advisors clinique
consultants aramis selling specialists prescriptives analysts and origins
guides

management information systems

management information systems support business processes including product
development marketing sales order processing production distribution and
finance of the many systems currently being utilized the most significant to
our business needs are i a centralized data repository of essential
attributes for each of the products we offer or plan to offer which enables us
to globally manufacture and market products of consistent quality ii a sales
analysis system to track weekly sales at the stock keeping unit sku level at
most significant retail sales locations ie sellthrough data increasing our
understanding of consumer preferences and enabling us to coordinate more
effectively our product development manufacturing and marketing strategies
iii an automated replenishment system with many of our key domestic customers
allowing us to replenish inventories for individual points of sale
automatically with minimal paperwork and iv an inventory management system
to provide us with a global view of finished goods availability relative to
actual requirements resulting in improved inventory control and distribution
for both existing product lines and new product launches

the efficiencies provided by these systems have resulted in increased sales
fewer outofstocks and reduced retail inventories we expect that these systems
will continue to provide inventory and sales efficiencies in the short and
medium terms

as part of our ongoing effort to enhance these efficiencies we are evaluating
enterprisewide global programs that could deliver a single set of integrated
data processes and technologies which would be scalable and used to
standardize business processes across brands operating units and sales
affiliates

products and redesign or reformulate existing products in addition research

personnel on a worldwide basis to ensure consistent global standards for our

products and provides ongoing technical assistance and knowhow to our
manufacturing activities the research and development group has had
longstanding working relationships with several us and international medical

manufacturing and raw materials

we manufacture skin care makeup fragrance and hair care products primarily in
the united states belgium switzerland the united kingdom and canada we
continue to streamline our manufacturing processes and identify sourcing
opportunities to improve innovation increase efficiencies and reduce costs our
major manufacturing facilities operate as focus plants that primarily
manufacture one type of product eg lipsticks for all of the principal
brands our plants are modern and our manufacturing processes are substantially
automated while we believe that our manufacturing facilities are sufficient to
meet current and reasonably anticipated manufacturing requirements we continue
to identify opportunities to make significant improvements in capacity and
productivity some of our finished products are manufactured to our
specifications by third parties

the principal raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are
essential oils alcohol and specialty chemicals we also purchase packaging
components that are manufactured to our design specifications procurement of
materials for all manufacturing facilities is generally made on a global basis
through our centralized supplier relations department a concentrated effort in
supplier rationalization has been made with the specific objective of reducing
costs increasing innovation and improving quality as a result of sourcing
initiatives there is increased dependency on certain suppliers but we believe
that these suppliers have adequate resources and facilities to overcome any
unforeseen interruption of supply we are continually benchmarking the
performance of the supply chain and will add or delete suppliers based upon the
changing needs of the business we have in the past been able to obtain an
adequate supply of essential raw materials and currently believe we have
adequate sources of supply for virtually all components of our products as we
integrate acquired brands we continually seek new ways to leverage our
production and sourcing capabilities to improve manufacturing performance

item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
of operations

critical accounting policies and estimates

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations
are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united
states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
liabilities revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements these
judgments can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could
differ from those estimates our most critical accounting policies relate to
revenue recognition concentration of credit risk inventory pension and other
postretirement benefit costs goodwill and other intangible assets income
taxes and derivatives

revenue recognition

generally revenues from merchandise sales are recorded at the time the product
is shipped to the customer we report our sales levels on a net sales basis
which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual returns
received and an amount established for anticipated returns

as is customary in the cosmetics industry our practice is to accept returns of
our products from retailers if properly requested authorized and approved in
accepting returns we typically provide a credit to the retailer against sales
and accounts receivable from that retailer on a dollarfordollar basis

our sales return accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct
impact on reported net sales this accrual is calculated based on a history of
gross sales and actual returns by region and product category in addition as
necessary specific accruals may be established for future known or anticipated
events as a percentage of gross sales sales returns were 52 49 and 49
in fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively

concentration of credit risk

an entity is more vulnerable to concentrations of credit risk if it is exposed
to risk of loss greater than it would have had it mitigated its risk through
diversification of customers such risks of loss manifest themselves
differently depending on the nature of the concentration and vary in
significance

we have three major customers that owned and operated retail stores that in the
aggregate accounted for approximately 124 billion or 24 of our consolidated
net sales in fiscal 2003 and 1798 million or 28 of our accounts receivable
at june 30 2003 these customers sell products primarily within north america
although management believes that these customers are sound and creditworthy a
severe adverse impact on their business operations could have a corresponding
material adverse effect on our net sales cash flows andor financial
condition

in the ordinary course of business we have established an allowance for
doubtful accounts and customer deductions in the amount of 318 million and
306 million as of june 30 2003 and 2002 respectively our allowance for
doubtful accounts is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on
reported net earnings this reserve is based upon the evaluation of accounts
receivable aging specific exposures and historical trends

inventory

we state our inventory at the lower of cost or fair market value with cost
being determined on the firstin firstout fifo method we believe fifo most
closely matches the flow of our products from manufacture through sale the
reported net value of our inventory includes saleable products promotional
products raw materials and componentry that will be sold or used in future
periods inventory cost includes raw materials direct labor and overhead

we also record an inventory obsolescence reserve which represents the
difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value
based on various product sales projections this reserve is calculated using an
estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age
historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales in addition and
as necessary we may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated
events

pension and other postretirement benefit costs

we offer the following benefits to some or all of our employees a domestic
trustbased noncontributory defined benefit pension plan us plan an
unfunded nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits
in excess of statutory limitations a contributory defined contribution plan
international pension plans which vary by country consisting of both defined
benefit and defined contribution pension plans deferred compensation and
certain other postretirement benefits



                                      17
page


the amounts necessary to fund future payouts under these plans are subject to
numerous assumptions and variables certain significant variables require us to
make assumptions that are within our control such as an anticipated discount
rate expected rate of return on plan assets and future compensation levels we
evaluate these assumptions with our actuarial advisors and we believe they are
within accepted industry ranges although an increase or decrease in the
assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a direct impact on
reported net earnings

the preretirement discount rate for each plan used for determining future
pension obligations is based on a review of highly rated longterm bonds at
june 30 2003 we used a preretirement discount rate for our us plan of 575
and varying rates on our international plans of between 275 and 70 for
fiscal 2003 we used an expected return on plan assets of 85 for our us plan
and varying rates of between 45 and 825 for our international plans in
determining the longterm rate of return for a plan we consider the historical
rates of return the nature of the plans investments and an expectation for the
plans investment strategies the us plan asset allocation as of june 30 2003
was approximately 58 equity investments 23 fixed income investments 13 cash
and 6 other investments

for fiscal 2004 we will use a preretirement discount rate for the us plan of
575 and anticipate using an expected return on plan assets of 800 the
change in this assumption from that used in fiscal 2003 will cause an increase
in pension expense in fiscal 2004 we will continue to monitor the market
conditions relative to these assumptions and adjust them accordingly

goodwill and other intangible assets

goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over
the value of their underlying net assets other intangible assets principally
consist of purchased royalty rights and trademarks goodwill and other
intangible assets that have an indefinite life are not amortized

on an annual basis we test goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment
to determine the fair value of these intangible assets there are many
assumptions and estimates used that directly impact the results of the testing
we have the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the
assumptions and estimates we choose to mitigate undue influence we use
industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and
approved by various levels of management additionally we evaluate our recorded
goodwill with the assistance of a thirdparty valuation firm

income taxes

we have accounted for and currently account for income taxes in accordance
with sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes this statement establishes
financial accounting and reporting standards for the effects of income taxes
that result from an enterprises activities during the current and preceding
years it requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and
reporting of income taxes

as of june 30 2003 we have current net deferred tax assets of 1160 million
and noncurrent net deferred tax assets of 387 million these net deferred tax
assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization as well as the
continued application of current tax rates included in net deferred tax assets
is a valuation allowance of approximately 29 million for deferred tax assets
which relates to foreign tax loss carryforwards not utilized to date where
management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will
not be realized in the relevant jurisdiction based on our assessments no
additional valuation allowance is required if we determine that a deferred tax
asset will not be realizable an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will
result in a reduction of earnings at that time

furthermore we provide tax reserves for federal state and international
exposures relating to audit results planning initiatives and compliance
responsibilities the development of these reserves requires judgments about tax
issues potential outcomes and timing and is a subjective critical estimate

derivatives

we currently account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with
sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as
amended which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts and for hedging activities this statement also requires the
recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the
balance sheet and that they be measured at fair value



                                      18
page


we currently use derivative financial instruments to hedge certain anticipated
transactions and interest rates as well as receivables and payables denominated
in foreign currencies we do not utilize derivatives for trading or speculative
purposes hedge effectiveness is documented assessed and monitored by our
employees who are qualified to make such assessments and monitor the
instruments variables that are external to us such as social political and
economic risks may have an impact on our hedging program and the results
thereof

the following tables present reconciliations of our financial results for the
fiscal years ended june 30 2003 2002 and 2001 as reported in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap and those
results adjusted to exclude certain charges described above each table we have
presented these reconciliations because of the special nature of the charges or
the fact that they are not necessarily comparable from period to period we
believe that such measures provide investors with a view of our ongoing business
trends and results of operations this is consistent with the approach used by
management in its evaluation and monitoring of such trends and results and
provides investors with a base for evaluating future periods

while we consider the nongaap financial measures useful in analyzing our
results it is not intended to replace or act as a substitute for any
presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in
conformity with gaap

do not expect to take a charge of a similar magnitude for a single matter like

fiscal 2003 as compared with fiscal 2002

net sales

net sales increased 8 or 3739 million to 51176 million reflecting growth
in all product categories and each of our geographic regions product category
results were led by skin care and our regions were led by europe the middle
east  africa where results benefited from favorable foreign exchange rates to
the us dollar and improvements in the travel retail business travel retail
improved during the middle of fiscal 2003 compared with lower results during the
middle of fiscal 2002 but was adversely affected during the last quarter of
fiscal 2003 by certain world events including the lingering effects of the war
in iraq and concerns relating to sars such events may affect our future sales
and earnings excluding the impact of foreign currency translation net sales
increased 4

product categories

skin care

net sales of skin care products increased 11 or 1904 million to 18937
million which was primarily attributable to the recent launches of
perfectionist correcting serum for lineswrinkles and resilience lift overnight
face and throat creme by estee lauder and the repairwear line of products and
advanced stop signs from clinique additionally the increase was supported by
strong sales of comforting cream cleanser moisture surge extra thirsty skin
relief and moisture surge eye gel and products in the 3step skin care system
by clinique as well as by renutriv ultimate lifting creme from estee lauder
and a perfect world line of products by origins partially offsetting this
increase were lower net sales of certain existing products such as stop signs
total turnaround cream and turnaround cream by clinique and idealist skin
refinisher by estee lauder excluding the impact of foreign currency
translation skin care net sales increased 7

makeup

makeup net sales increased 7 or 1189 million to 19094 million due to
strong sales of our makeup artist lines and current year launches of dewy smooth
antiaging makeup and colour surge lipstick by clinique and magnascopic maximum
volume mascara and artists lip and eye pencils from estee lauder also
contributing to growth were strong sales from estee lauder brand products
including so ingenious multidimension liquid makeup and loose powder as well
as from new and existing products in the pure color line offsetting this
increase were lower net sales of certain existing products such as sumptuous
lipstick from estee lauder and gentle light makeup and powder and high impact
eye shadow duos by clinique excluding the impact of foreign currency
translation makeup net sales increased 4

fragrance

net sales of fragrance products increased 4 or 423 million to 10596
million primarily reflecting the effects of favorable foreign currency exchange
rates to the us dollar the fragrance industry continues to experience a
difficult environment the travel retail business which depends substantially
on fragrance products began to improve in the middle of the fiscal year
relative to the prior year however the latter part of fiscal 2003 was adversely
affected by international uncertainties stemming from events in iraq and
concerns relating to sars in fiscal 2003 we successfully launched estee lauder
pleasures intense t girl by tommy hilfiger clinique happy heart lauder
intuition for men and donna karan black cashmere net sales also benefited from
strong sales of beautiful by estee lauder and aromatics elixir from clinique
offsetting these increases and sales from new product launches were lower net
sales of certain tommy hilfiger products intuition by estee lauder and estee
lauder pleasures excluding the impact of foreign currency translation
fragrance net sales were relatively unchanged from the prior year

hair care

hair care net sales increased 6 or 131 million to 2289 million this
increase was primarily the result of sales growth from aveda and bumble and
bumble products we also increased the number of companyowned aveda experience
centers and strategically decreased the number of salons that offer aveda
products partially offsetting the increase were lower net sales of cliniques
simple hair care system

the introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of
existing products which we take into account in our business planning

geographic regions

net sales in the americas increased 3 or 752 million to 29534 million
primarily reflecting growth from our newer brands as well as the success of new
and recently launched products despite the increase we continue to experience
a soft retail environment in the united states

in europe the middle east  africa net sales increased 19 or 2453 million
to 15064 million net sales in the united kingdom spain italy france
switzerland and greece experienced doubledigit growth also contributing to the
increase with doubledigit growth was our worldwide travel retail business as
sales recovered from the levels experienced after september 11 2001 however
our travel retail business was adversely affected at the end of fiscal 2003 by
certain world events including the lingering effects of the war in iraq and
concerns associated with sars excluding the impact of foreign currency
translation europe the middle east  africa net sales increased 8

net sales in asiapacific increased 8 or 472 million to 6578 million
primarily due to higher net sales in korea japan australia and thailand
despite increased net sales in japan the country remains a difficult market due
to local economic conditions and competition excluding the impact of foreign
currency translation asiapacific net sales increased 3

we strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market which
may account for differences in regional sales growth

cost of sales

cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales improved to 261 from 268
reflecting production and supply chain efficiencies and lower costs from
promotional activities

we continued to emphasize sourcing initiatives and overall supply chain
management which resulted in lower manufacturing costs whereas in the prior
year we experienced underabsorption of overhead as a result of the impact of
the events of september 11 2001

the inclusion of promotional merchandise as a component of cost of sales results
in lower margins a strategic shift to reduce these activities has contributed
to the improvement in our gross profit margin for the year the inclusion of the
cost of purchase with purchase and gift with purchase merchandise as a component
of cost of sales resulted from our adoption of eitf issue no 019 since the
cost of these promotional activities is a component of cost of sales and the
timing and level of promotions vary with our promotional calendar we have
experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in the cost of
sales percentage

operating expenses

operating expenses decreased to 642 of net sales as compared with 660 of net
sales in the prioryear period the current year results were impacted by a
charge related to the pending settlement of a legal proceeding of 220 million
or 04 of net sales prioryear operating expenses included a restructuring
charge of 1104 million or 23 of net sales before considering the effect of
these two charges operating expenses increased slightly to 638 of net sales
compared with 635 of net sales in the prior year the increase in spending
primarily related to advertising sampling and merchandising activities
particularly during the early portion of fiscal 2003 excluding purchase with
purchase and gift with purchase activities discussed as a component of cost of
sales which supported our sales growth and built momentum going into the second
half of fiscal 2003 changes in advertising sampling and merchandising spending
result from the type timing and level of activities related to product launches
and rollouts as well as the markets being emphasized

operating results

operating income increased 45 or 1537 million to 4951 million as compared
with the prioryear period operating margins were 97 of net sales in the
current period as compared with 72 in the prioryear period these results
include a charge related to the pending settlement of a legal proceeding of
220 million in the current year and a prior year restructuring charge of
1174 million absent these items operating income increased 13 or 583
million to 5171 million and operating margins increased to 101 as compared
with 97 in fiscal 2002 these increases in operating income and operating
margin reflect sales growth including the benefits from favorable foreign
currency exchange rates to the us dollar and gross margin improvement as well
as benefits from our prior restructurings and our continued cost containment
efforts

net earnings and net earnings per diluted share increased approximately 67 and
80 respectively net earnings improved 1279 million to 3198 million and
net earnings per diluted share increased by 56 from 70 to 126 absent the
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in fiscal 2002 net
earnings increased by 1073 million or 50 and diluted earnings per common
share increased 62 to 126 from 78 in the prior year before the fiscal 2003
charge related to the pending settlement of a legal proceeding and the fiscal
2002 restructuring and the cumulative effect of adopting a new accounting
principle net earnings increased 15 to 3333 million and diluted earnings per
common share increased 20 to 132 from 110 in the prior year

the following discussions of operating results by product categories and
geographic regions exclude the impact of the fiscal 2003 charge related to the
pending settlement of a legal proceeding and the fiscal 2002 restructuring we
believe the following analysis of operating income better reflects the manner in
which we conduct and view our business the tables on page 21 reconcile these
results to operating income as reported in the consolidated statement of
earnings

product categories

operating income more than doubled to 321 million in fragrance due primarily
to improved results from our travel retail business operating income increased
10 to 2732 million in skin care and 8 to 1980 million in makeup reflecting
higher net sales partially offset by strategic spending on advertising
sampling and merchandising particularly in the earlier portion of the current
year operating income increased 11 million or 8 to 148 million in hair
care reflecting improvements in aveda and bumble and bumble as well as higher
profits in the latter portion of the year outside the united states

geographic regions

operating income in the americas increased 11 or 238 million to 2467
million due to sales growth the benefits of our prior restructurings and
continued cost containment efforts operating income also benefited from the
results of strategic efforts related to product support spending in the earlier
part of the year that led to increased net sales during the year in europe the
middle east  africa operating income increased 27 or 478 million to 2277
million primarily due to the improved operating results in the united kingdom as
well as increased results generated from our travel retail business as
described elsewhere profitability in the region has been and will continue to
be affected by current international uncertainties in asiapacific operating
income decreased 24 or 133 million to 427 million this decrease reflects
improved results in korea and thailand which were more than offset by a
decrease in australia which derived a benefit in the prioryear period from a
change in our retailer arrangements

interest expense net

net interest expense was 81 million as compared with 98 million in the prior
year the decrease in net interest expense was primarily due to lower
outstanding net borrowings and higher interest income generated by higher
invested cash balances this improvement was partially offset by a higher
effective interest rate which resulted from the increased proportion of fixed
rate debt as compared with variable rate debt in the same period last year in
may 2003 we executed a fixedto floating interest rate swap on our 2500
million 6 senior notes due 2012 see liquidity and capital resources for
further details

provision for income taxes

the provision for income taxes represents federal foreign state and local
income taxes the effective rate for income taxes for the fiscal year was 330
as compared with 345 in the prioryear period these rates differ from
statutory rates reflecting the effect of state and local taxes tax rates in
foreign jurisdictions and certain nondeductible expenses the decrease in the
effective tax rate was principally attributable to ongoing tax planning
initiatives including the favorable settlement of certain tax negotiations and
the reduction of the overall tax rate relating to the companys foreign
operations in addition the tax effect of the charge related to the pending
settlement of a legal proceeding in late fiscal 2003 contributed to an effective
tax rate slightly lower than previously expected

fiscal 2002 as compared with fiscal 2001

net sales

net sales increased 2 or 760 million to 474 billion reflecting growth in
the makeup skin care and hair care categories partially offset by a decline in
fragrance net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency translation net
sales increased 3 the unusual events that occurred during fiscal 2002 and
their effect on the economy particularly in the united states adversely
impacted our business in addition the decline in worldwide travel during most
of fiscal 2002 led to a 13 reduction in our travel retail sales sales growth
from certain newer brands and recently launched products partially offset these
decreases

the following discussions of net sales by product categories and geographic
regions exclude the impact of the restructurings in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001
neither restructuring was material to our net sales and we believe the
following analysis of net sales better reflects the manner in which we conduct
and view our business for a discussion of the restructurings see operating
expenses  restructuring and special charges in this section the tables on
pages 21 and 22 reconcile these results to operating income as reporting in the
consolidated statement of earnings

product categories

skin care

net sales of skin care products increased 3 or 426 million to 170 billion
the net sales increase is primarily attributable to recently launched products
such as total turnaround visible skin renewer advanced night repair eye
recovery complex moisture surge extra thirsty skin relief and moisture surge
eye gel a perfect world line of products lightsource transforming moisture
lotion and cream and renutriv ultimate lifting creme partially offsetting
these increases were lower net sales of certain existing products such as
turnaround cream and resilience lift as well as products in cliniques 3step
skin care system

makeup

makeup net sales increased 4 or 689 million to 179 billion newer brands
such as mac bobbi brown and stila which are primarily makeup products
contributed through growth at existing doors and increased distribution in
addition strong sales of the pure color line of products the worldwide launch
of gentle light makeup and illusionist mascara contributed positively to net
sales growth partially offsetting the increase in net sales were lower sales of
twoinone eye shadow lucidity makeup and long last soft shine lipstick

fragrance

net sales of fragrance products decreased 6 or 678 million to 102 billion
this category was impacted by the softness of the fragrance business in the
united states and the decline in our travel retail business which depends
substantially on fragrance products lower net sales of beautiful estee lauder
pleasures dkny for women and certain existing tommy hilfiger products were
partially offset by the launch of t a fragrance in the tommy hilfiger line and
intuition for men as well as strong sales of donna karan cashmere mist

hair care

hair care net sales increased 19 or 351 million to 2158 million this
increase was primarily the result of growth from aveda which benefited from the
launch of texture lotion products and color conserve shampoo and an increase in
the number of companyowned aveda experience centers sales of bumble and bumble
products increased due to an expanded product line and an increase in the number
of points of sale the results were partially offset by lower sales from
cliniques simple hair care system when compared with the prioryear launch

the introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of
existing products which we take into account in our business planning



                                      26
page


geographic regions

net sales in the americas increased 1 or 204 million to 288 billion the
increase was primarily due to the success of most newer brands partially offset
by economic weakness and uncertainty in the united states during most of the
fiscal year in europe the middle east  africa net sales increased 3 or
393 million to 126 billion this increase was primarily the result of higher
net sales in the united kingdom spain and greece where in fiscal 2002 we
formed a joint venture in which we own a controlling majority interest with
our former distributor the increase was partially offset by lower net sales in
our travel retail business which has been adversely affected by a decrease in
worldwide travel excluding the impact of our travel retail business net sales
in europe the middle east  africa increased 8 or 778 million net sales in
asiapacific increased 2 or 145 million to 6106 million primarily due to
higher net sales in korea and thailand as well as in australia where we
benefited from a change in retailer arrangements the increased sales were
partially offset by lower net sales in japan japan continued to be a difficult
market due to local economic conditions and increasing competition the
challenges were made more difficult by the weakness of the japanese yen during
fiscal 2002 as compared with the us dollar excluding the impact of foreign
currency translation asiapacific net sales increased 9

we strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market which
may account for differences in regional sales growth

cost of sales

cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales was 268 as compared with
263 in the prior year the lower margin can be attributed in part to
production volume decreases resulting in underabsorption of overhead as well
as lower than planned raw material purchases that reduced anticipated savings
from sourcing initiatives partially offsetting these negative factors were
lower sales volumes of products with a higher cost of goods particularly in
travel retail and fragrance

operating expenses

operating expenses increased to 660 of net sales as compared with 631 of net
sales in the prior year the increase in operating expenses primarily related to
restructuring expenses continued advertising and promotional spending and the
cost to expand and operate our retail stores the increase in operating expenses
as a percentage of net sales reflects a slower growth rate in sales than
operating expenses primarily due to economic conditions in the united states as
discussed above as part of our longterm strategies we continued to emphasize
the building of brand equities through advertising and promotional spending
and retail store expansion despite difficult economic times changes in
advertising and promotional spending result from the type timing and level of
advertising and promotional activities related to product launches and rollouts
as well as the markets being emphasized excluding the impact of restructuring
and special charges operating expenses were 635 and 619 of net sales for
the fiscal years ended 2002 and 2001 respectively

restructuring and special charges

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 we recorded charges for a
restructuring related to repositioning certain businesses as part of our ongoing
efforts to drive longterm growth and increase profitability the restructuring
focused on cost reduction opportunities related to the internet our supply
chain globalization of the organization and distribution channel refinements
we committed to a defined plan of action which resulted in an aggregate pretax
charge of 1174 million of which 594 million is cash related on an
aftertax basis the aggregate charge was 769 million equal to 32 per
diluted share





                                      27

specifically the charge included the following

o    internet in an effort to achieve strategic objectives reduce costs and
     improve profitability we outsourced glosscom platform development and
     maintenance efforts to a thirdparty provider additionally glosscom
     closed its san francisco facility and consolidated its operations in new
     york as a result included in the charge was a 239 million provision for
     restructuring the glosscom operations including benefits and severance
     packages for 36 employees as well as asset writeoffs we also took a 201
     million charge to write off the related glosscom acquisition goodwill

o    supply chain building on previously announced supply chain initiatives we
     restructured certain manufacturing distribution research and development
     information systems and quality assurance operations in the united states
     canada and europe which included benefits and severance for 110 employees
     a charge of 237 million was recorded related to this effort

o    globalization of organization we continued to implement our transition
     announced in 2001 to a global brand structure designed to streamline the
     decisionmaking process and increase innovation and speedtomarket the
     next phase of this transition entailed eliminating duplicate functions and
     responsibilities which resulted in charges for benefits and severance for
     122 employees we recorded a charge of 271 million associated with these
     efforts

o    distribution we evaluated areas of distribution relative to our financial
     targets and decided to focus our resources on the most productive sales
     channels and markets as a result we closed our operations in argentina
     and the remaining customers are being serviced by our chilean affiliate we
     began to close all remaining instore tommys shops and we identified for
     closing other select points of distribution we recorded a 226 million
     provision related to these actions which included benefits and severance
     for 85 employees

following is a summary of the charges as recorded in the consolidated statement

the restructuring charge was recorded in other accrued liabilities or where
applicable as a reduction of the related asset during fiscal 2002 93
million related to this restructuring was paid we expected to and did settle
a majority of the remaining obligations by the end of fiscal 2003 with certain
additional payments to be made ratably through fiscal 2006

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 we recorded charges for restructuring
and special charges related to repositioning certain businesses as part of our
ongoing efforts to drive longterm growth and increase profitability the
restructuring and special charges focused on four areas product fixtures for
the jane brand instore tommy shops information systems and other assets
and global brand reorganization we committed to a defined plan of action which
resulted in an aggregate pretax charge of 630 million of which 359 million
is cash related on an aftertax basis the aggregate charge was 403 million
equal to 17 per diluted share as of june 30 2003 the remaining obligation
was 26 million with payments expected to be made ratably through fiscal 2004

operating results

operating income decreased 31 or 1542 million to 3414 million as compared
with the prior year operating margins were 72 of net sales in fiscal 2002 as
compared with 106 in the prior year the decrease in operating margin was
primarily due to restructuring expenses lower than expected sales levels
increased support spending and new distribution channel costs this was
partially offset by the exclusion of amortization expense due to the adoption of
sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets in fiscal 2002 and the
november 2000 expiration of amortization related to purchased royalty rights
operating income reflected the inclusion of restructuring and special charges of
1174 million and 630 million in fiscal 2002 and 2001 respectively before
consideration of the restructuring and special charges operating income
decreased 18 to 4588 million and operating margins were 97 in fiscal 2002
as compared with 119 in fiscal 2001

net earnings and net earnings per diluted share decreased approximately 37 and
39 respectively net earnings declined 1133 million to 1919 million and
net earnings per diluted share was lower by 46 per diluted share from 116 to
70 on a comparable basis before restructuring and special charges before
the cumulative effect of adopting a new accounting principle and excluding
goodwill amortization in fiscal 2001 net earnings were 2894 million
representing a decrease of 20 over the prior year and diluted earnings per
common share decreased 21 to 110 from 139 in the prior year

the following discussions of operating results by product categories and
geographic regions exclude the impact of restructuring and special charges we
believe the following analysis of operating income better reflects the manner in
which we conduct and view our business the tables on pages 21 and 22 reconcile
these results to operating income as reported in the consolidated statement of
earnings

product categories

operating income decreased 79 to 134 million in fragrance 14 to 1832
million in makeup and 7 to 2484 million in skin care primarily due to lower
than anticipated sales levels coupled with continued advertising and
promotional spending to promote new and recently launched products hair care
operating income increased 5 from a smaller base to 137 million primarily
due to sales growth from aveda and bumble and bumble

geographic regions

operating income in the americas decreased 26 or 770 million to 2229
million primarily due to lower sales attributable to weakness in the us
economy and continued advertising and promotional spending in europe the
middle east  africa operating income decreased 11 or 219 million to 1799
million primarily due to the significant decrease in our travel retail
business partially offsetting the decrease were improved operating results in
italy the united kingdom spain and germany we also benefited from the
inclusion of operating results from our majorityowned joint venture in greece
in asiapacific operating income decreased slightly to 560 million due to
lower income in china and hong kong offset by higher results in korea in
australia where we benefited from a change in retailer arrangements and in
japan where we were able to reduce operating expenses

interest expense net

net interest expense was 98 million as compared with 123 million in the
prior year the decrease in net interest expense resulted from a lower effective
interest rate compared with the prior year this was primarily due to our
interest rate risk management strategy that relied on commercial paper and
variablerate term loans in january 2002 we took advantage of prevailing
market rates and issued fixed rate longterm notes to replace our variablerate
debt

provision for income taxes

the companys effective tax rate will change from year to year based on
nonrecurring and recurring factors including but not limited to the
geographical mix of earnings the timing and amount of foreign dividends state
and local taxes tax audit settlements and the interaction of various global tax
strategies

the provision for income taxes represents federal foreign state and local
income taxes the effective rate for income taxes for fiscal 2002 was 345
compared with 36 in the prior year these rates reflect the effect of state and
local taxes changes in tax rates in foreign jurisdictions tax credits and
certain nondeductible expenses the decrease in the effective income tax rate
was attributable to ongoing tax planning initiatives as well as a decrease in
nondeductible domestic royalty expense and the elimination of certain
nondeductible goodwill amortization resulting from the implementation of sfas
no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets

financial condition

liquidity and capital resources

our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations
and borrowings under commercial paper borrowings from the issuance of longterm
debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks in the united
states and abroad at june 30 2003 we had cash and cash equivalents of 3641
million compared with 5469 million at june 30 2002

at june 30 2003 our outstanding borrowings of 2914 million included i
2571 million of 6 senior notes due january 2012 consisting of 2500 million
principal an unamortized debt discount of 10 million and an 81 million
adjustment to reflect the fair value of an outstanding interest rate swap ii
a 30 billion yen term loan approximately 252 million at current exchange
rates which is due in march 2006 iii 78 million of other shortterm
borrowings and iv 13 million of other longterm borrowings

in may 2003 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional
amount of 2500 million to effectively convert the fixed rate interest on our
outstanding 2500 million 6 senior notes to variable interest rates based on
libor in the shortterm this will provide us with a lower level of interest
expense related to the 6 senior notes based on current variable interest rates
however over the life of the notes interest expense may be greater than 6
based upon the fluctuations of libor

we have a 7500 million commercial paper program under which we may issue
commercial paper in the united states our commercial paper is currently rated
a1 by standard  poors and p1 by moodys our longterm credit ratings are a
by standard  poors and a1 by moodys at june 30 2003 we had no commercial
paper outstanding we also have an effective shelf registration statement
covering the potential issuance of up to 5000 million in debt securities as
of june 30 2003 we had an unused 4000 million revolving credit facility
expiring on june 28 2006 and 1566 million in additional uncommitted credit
facilities

our business is seasonal in nature and accordingly our working capital needs
vary from time to time we may enter into investing and financing transactions
that require additional funding to the extent that these needs exceed cash from
operations we could subject to market conditions issue commercial paper
issue longterm debt securities or borrow under the revolving credit facility

the effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating
results in recent years generally we have been able to introduce new products
at higher selling prices or increase selling prices sufficiently to offset cost
increases which have been moderate

we believe that cash on hand cash generated from operations available credit
lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned
business operations and capital expenditures on both a nearterm and longterm
basis

cash flows

net cash provided by operating activities was 5485 million in fiscal 2003 as
compared with 5180 million in fiscal 2002 and 3054 million in fiscal 2001
the improved operating cash flow primarily reflects increased earnings and
seasonal levels of operating assets and liabilities operating assets and
liabilities reflect an improvement in accounts receivable collections and a
higher level of accounts payable partially offset by increased inventories in
anticipation of product launches in the first half of fiscal 2004 and the impact
of acquisitions on required inventory levels the improvement in net cash flows
for fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was generated primarily by a reduction
of inventory inventory levels were unseasonably high at the end of fiscal 2001
and were lowered during fiscal 2002 as part of our effort to keep inventory
levels in line with forecasted sales operating cash flows were generally not
impacted by the fiscal 2002 restructuring as lower net earnings were offset by
the noncash portion of the charge and the increase in other accrued
liabilities

net cash used for investing activities was 1925 million in fiscal 2003
compared with 2170 million in fiscal 2002 and 2063 million in fiscal 2001
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2003 primarily relates to
capital expenditures and the acquisition of darphin and certain aveda
distributors net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2002 and
fiscal 2001 relates primarily to capital expenditures



                                      30
page


capital expenditures amounted to 1631 million 2032 million and 1922
million in fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively spending in all three years
primarily reflected the continued upgrade of manufacturing equipment dies and
molds new store openings store improvements counter construction and
information technology enhancements the reduced level of capital expenditures
in fiscal 2003 reflects tight control on our spending in light of economic
conditions fewer retail store openings and reduced spending related to
leasehold improvements

cash used for financing activities was 5504 million 1218 million and 635
million in fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the net cash used for
financing activities in 2003 primarily relates to common stock repurchases the
repayment of longterm debt and dividend payments net cash used for financing
during fiscal 2002 primarily relates to dividend payments and common stock
repurchases the net cash used in fiscal 2001 was primarily related to dividend
payments

dividends

the board of directors declared and we paid on our class a common stock and
class b common stock an annual dividend of 20 per share in fiscal 2003 and
quarterly dividends at the rate of 05 per share in each quarter of fiscal 2002
and 2001 the last quarterly dividend of 05 per share was paid in the first
quarter of fiscal 2003 as previously disclosed the board of directors
determined that at its discretion it would declare and the company would pay
dividends on its common stock annually rather than quarterly commencing in
fiscal 2003 in fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 dividends declared on our common
stock totaled 465 million 475 million and 477 million respectively
total dividends declared including dividends on the 650 cumulative redeemable
preferred stock were 699 million 709 million and 711 million in fiscal
2003 2002 and 2001 respectively

share repurchase program

in september 1998 our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program
to repurchase a total of up to 80 million shares of class a common stock in the
open market or in privately negotiated transactions depending on market
conditions and other factors in october 2002 the board of directors authorized
the repurchase of up to 100 million additional shares of class a common stock
increasing the total authorization under the share repurchase program to 180
million shares during fiscal 2003 we purchased 112 million shares for 3524
million as of june 30 2003 we have purchased approximately 138 million
shares under this program subsequent to yearend we purchased an additional
04 million shares for 123 million bringing the cumulative total of acquired
shares to 142 million

pension plan funding and expense

we maintain pension plans covering substantially all of our fulltime employees
for our us operations and a majority of our international operations several
plans provide pension benefits based primarily on years of service and
employees earnings in the united states we maintain a trustbased
noncontributory defined benefit pension plan us plan additionally we
have an unfunded nonqualified domestic benefit plan to provide benefits in
excess of internal revenue code limitations our international pension plans are
comprised of defined benefit and defined contribution plans

several factors influence our annual funding requirements for the us plan
our funding policy consists of an annual contribution at a rate that provides
for future plan benefits and maintains appropriate funded percentages such
contribution is not less than the minimum required by the employee retirement
income security act of 1974 as amended erisa and subsequent pension
legislation and is not more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax
purposes for each international plan our funding policies are determined by
local laws and regulations in addition amounts necessary to fund future
obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions as
detailed in critical accounting polices and estimates the effect on
operating results in the future of pension plan funding will depend on economic
conditions employee demographics mortality rates the number of participants
electing to take lumpsum distributions investment performance and funding
decisions

during fiscal 2003 we changed certain of the underlying assumptions associated
with our pension plans based upon the recent past performance and outlook of the
securities markets resulting in a larger funding requirement in addition the
assets associated with the pension plans experienced negative investment
returns which also affected our funding requirements even after considering
the impact of these factors there was no minimum contribution to the us plan
required by erisa for fiscal 2003 and 2002 however at managements discretion
we made cash contributions to the us plan of 760 million and 430 million
during fiscal 2003 and 2002 respectively



                                      31
page


in addition at june 30 2003 we recognized a liability on our balance sheet
for each pension plan if the fair market value of the assets of that plan was
less than the accumulated benefit obligation and accordingly a charge is
recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders
equity during fiscal 2003 and 2002 we recorded a charge to accumulated other
comprehensive income loss of 203 million and 79 million respectively
this charge had no impact on our consolidated net earnings or liquidity

commitments and contingencies

we will be required to redeem the outstanding 650 cumulative redeemable
preferred stock on june 30 2005 however in the event that mrs estee lauder
were to pass away before such date then we would have the right to redeem the
shares from the current holders and the holders of such shares would have the
right to put the shares to us at 100 per share for an aggregate cost of
3600 million if shares of 650 cumulative redeemable preferred stock are
put to us we would have up to 120 days after notice to purchase such shares

certain of our business acquisition agreements include earnout provisions
these provisions generally require that we pay to the seller or sellers of the
business additional amounts based on the performance of the acquired business
the payments typically are made after a certain period of time and our next
earnout payment is expected to be made after the end of fiscal 2005 since
the size of each payment depends upon performance of the acquired business we
do not expect that such payments will have a material adverse impact on our
future results of operations or financial condition

sales royalty payments totaling 203 million 165 million and 160 million
in fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively have been charged to expense such

business acquisitions and license agreements

in april 2003 we acquired the parisbased darphin group of companies that
develops manufactures and markets the darphin brand of skin care products
the initial purchase price paid at closing was funded by cash provided by
operations and did not have a material effect on our results of operations or
financial condition an additional payment is expected to be made in fiscal
2009 the amount of which will depend on future net sales and earnings of the
darphin business

in may 2003 we entered into a license agreement to manufacture and sell
fragrances and beauty products under the michael kors trademarks with michael
kors llc at the same time we purchased certain related rights and inventory
from american designer fragrances a division of lvmh

derivative financial instruments and hedging activities

we address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk
management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments we
primarily enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign
currency options to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange
rates we also enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the
effects of fluctuating interest rates we categorize these instruments as
entered into for purposes other than trading

for each derivative contract entered into where we look to obtain special hedge
accounting treatment we formally document the relationship between the hedging
instrument and hedged item as well as its riskmanagement objective and
strategy for undertaking the hedge this process includes linking all
derivatives that are designated as fairvalue cashflow or foreigncurrency
hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific
firm commitments or forecasted transactions we also formally assess both at
the hedges inception and on an ongoing basis whether the derivatives that are
used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair
values or cash flows of hedged items if it is determined that a derivative is
not highly effective then we will be required to discontinue hedge accounting
with respect to that derivative prospectively

foreign exchange risk management

we enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge anticipated transactions as
well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies for periods
consistent with our identified exposures the purpose of the hedging activities
is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on our costs and on
the cash flows that we receive from foreign subsidiaries almost all foreign
currency contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries
and are with large financial institutions rated as strong investment grade by a
major rating agency we also enter into foreign currency options to hedge
anticipated transactions where there is a high probability that anticipated
exposures will materialize the forward exchange contracts and foreign currency
options entered into to hedge anticipated transactions have been designated as
cashflow hedges as of june 30 2003 these cashflow hedges were highly
effective in all material respects

as a matter of policy we only enter into contracts with counterparties that
have at least an a or equivalent credit rating the counterparties to these
contracts are major financial institutions we do not have significant exposure
to any one counterparty our exposure to credit loss in the event of
nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to only the recognized
but not realized gains attributable to the contracts management believes risk
of loss under these hedging contracts is remote and in any event would not be
material to the consolidated financial results the contracts have varying
maturities through the end of june 2004 costs associated with entering into
such contracts have not been material to our consolidated financial results we
do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative
purposes at june 30 2003 we had foreign currency contracts in the form of
forward exchange contracts and option contracts in the amount of 4767 million
and 577 million respectively the foreign currencies included in forward
exchange contracts notional value stated in us dollars are principally the
euro 1140 million swiss franc 619 million japanese yen 560
million british pound 498 million canadian dollar 377 million south
korean won 376 million and australian dollar 306 million the foreign
currencies included in the option contracts notional value stated in us
dollars are principally the swiss franc 219 million canadian dollar 210
million and euro 117 million

interest rate risk management

we enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the exposure to
fluctuations of interest rates on our funded and unfunded indebtedness as well
as cash investments for periods consistent with the identified exposures all
interest rate derivative contracts are with large financial institutions rated
as strong investment grade by a major rating agency



                                      33

in may 2003 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional
amount of 2500 million to effectively convert fixed interest on the existing
2500 million 6 senior notes to variable interest rates based on libor we
designated the swap as a fair value hedge as of june 30 2003 the fair value
hedge was highly effective in all material respects

additionally in may 2003 we entered into a series of treasury lock agreements
on a notional amount totaling 1950 million at a weighted average allin rate
of 453 these treasury lock agreements expire in september 2003 and are used
to hedge the exposure to a possible rise in interest rates prior to the
anticipated issuance of debt the agreements will be settled upon the issuance
of the new debt if completed and any realized gain or loss to be received or
paid by us will be amortized in interest expense over the life of the new debt
we designated the treasury lock agreements as cash flow hedges as of june 30
2003 the cash flow hedges were highly effective in all material respects

market risk

we use a valueatrisk model to assess the market risk of our derivative
financial instruments valueatrisk represents the potential losses for an
instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors for a specified
time period and confidence level we estimate valueatrisk across all of our
derivative financial instruments using a model with historical volatilities and
correlations calculated over the past 250day period the measured
valueatrisk calculated as an average for the twelve months ended june 30
2003 related to our foreign exchange contracts was 76 million as of june 30
2003 the measured valueatrisk related to our interest rate contracts was
103 million the model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions
and a 95 percent confidence level we used a statistical simulation model that
valued our derivative financial instruments against one thousand randomly
generated market price paths

our calculated valueatrisk exposure represents an estimate of reasonably
possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative
financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and
is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may or may not occur it
does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may
occur since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated
based upon actual fluctuations in market rates operating exposures and the
timing thereof and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments
during the year

we believe however that any loss incurred would be offset by the effects of
market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the
hedge is intended

offbalance sheet arrangements

we do not maintain any offbalance sheet arrangements transactions obligations
or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to
have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results
of operations

recently issued accounting standards

in may 2003 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no
150 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both
liabilities and equity sfas no 150 sfas no 150 established standards for
classifying and measuring certain financial instruments with characteristics of
both liabilities and equity it specifically requires that mandatorily
redeemable instruments instruments with repurchase obligations which embody
are indexed to or obligate the repurchase of the issuers own equity shares
and instruments with obligations to issue a variable number of the issuers own
equity shares be classified as a liability initial and subsequent measurements
of the instruments differ based on the characteristics of each instrument and as
provided for in the statement sfas no 150 is effective for all freestanding
financial instruments entered into or modified after may 31 2003 and otherwise
became effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after
june 15 2003 we have adopted this statement effective for all instruments
entered into or modified after may 31 2003 and will adopt the statement for any
existing financial instruments in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 based on the
provisions of this statement beginning in fiscal 2004 we will be classifying
the 650 cumulative redeemable preferred stock as a liability and the related
dividends thereon will be characterized as interest expense restatement of
financial statements for earlier years presented is not permitted the adoption
of this statement will result in the inclusion of the dividends on the preferred
stock equal to 234 million per year as interest expense while the inclusion
will impact net earnings net earnings attributable to common stock and earnings
per common share will be unaffected given that the dividends are not deductible
for income tax purposes the inclusion of the preferred stock dividends as an
interest expense will cause an increase in our effective tax rate the adoption
of sfas no 150 will have no impact on our financial condition

in december 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 148 accounting for stockbased
compensation  transition and disclosure sfas no 148 sfas no 148
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair
value method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation as originally
defined by sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation additionally
sfas no 148 amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 123 to require
prominent disclosure in both the annual and interim financial statements about
the method of accounting for stockbased compensation and the effect of the
method used on reported results the transitional requirements of sfas no 148
are effective for all financial statements for fiscal years ending after
december 15 2002 we adopted the disclosure portion of this statement for the
fiscal quarter ended march 31 2003 the application of the disclosure portion
of this standard has no impact on our consolidated financial position or results
of operations the fasb recently indicated that it will require stockbased
employee compensation to be recorded as a charge to earnings pursuant to a
standard on which it is currently deliberating the fasb anticipates issuing an
exposure draft in the fourth quarter of 2003 and a final statement in the second
quarter of 2004 we will continue to monitor the fasbs progress on the issuance
of this standard as well as evaluate our position with respect to current
guidance

to the retailer against sales and accounts receivable from that retailer on a
dollarfordollar basis in recognition of this practice and in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles we report sales levels on a net basis
which is computed by deducting the amount of actual returns received and an
amount established for anticipated returns from gross sales as a percent of
gross sales returns were 49 in fiscal 2002 49 in fiscal 2001 and 43 in

marketing

our marketing strategy is built around our vision statement bringing the best
to everyone we touch mrs estee lauder formulated this marketing philosophy to
provide highquality service and products as the foundation for a solid and
loyal consumer base

our marketing efforts focus principally on promoting the quality and benefits of
our products each of our brands is distinctively positioned has a single
global image and is promoted with consistent logos packaging and advertising
designed to enhance its image and differentiate it from other brands we
regularly advertise our products on television and radio in upscale magazines
and prestigious newspapers and through direct mail and photo displays at
international airports promotional activities and instore displays are
designed to introduce existing consumers to different products in the line and
to attract new consumers our marketing efforts also benefit from cooperative
advertising programs with retailers some of which are supported by coordinated
promotions such as purchase with purchase and gift with purchase at instore
counters sales representatives offer personal demonstrations to market
individual products as well as to provide education on basic skin care and
makeup application we conduct extensive sampling programs and we pioneered gift
with purchase as a sampling program we believe that the quality and perceived
benefits of sample products have been effective inducements to purchases by new
and existing consumers

starting with the launch of the clinique website in 1996 we have used the
internet to educate and inform consumers about certain of our brands currently
there are thirteen singlebrand marketing sites five of which have ecommerce
capabilities and glosscom the companys majorityowned multibrand marketing
and ecommerce site

accepted accounting principles in addition our products receive extensive

consulting with sales representatives at the points of sale these include estee
lauder beauty advisors clinique consultants aramis selling specialists
prescriptives analysts and origins guides

management information systems

management information systems support automation of our business processes
including product development marketing sales order processing production
distribution and finance

we have deployed a product definition system that establishes and maintains a
centralized data repository of essential attributes for each of the products we
offer or plan to offer in the marketplace coupled with our product research and
development systems we are able to globally manufacture and market products of
consistent quality

our sales analysis system tracks weekly sales at the stock keeping unit sku
level at most retail sales locations ie sellthrough data this system is
currently tracking sellthrough data for almost all accounts of estee lauder
clinique aramis prescriptives origins mac bobbi brown donna karan
tommy hilfiger la mer and stila in the united states and canada the increased
understanding of consumer preferences gained from sellthrough data enables us
to coordinate more effectively our product development manufacturing and
marketing strategies we have implemented similar systems in other countries

we have negotiated automated replenishment arrangements with many of our key
domestic customers these arrangements enable us to replenish inventories for
individual points of sale automatically with minimal paperwork customer orders
for a substantial majority of sales of estee lauder clinique prescriptives
origins mac and bobbi brown products in the united states are generated by
automated replenishment systems

our data warehouse captures shipping sellthrough and inventory data for our
domestic business this system has resulted in streamlined and standardized
reporting as well as timely and accurate retail sales and marketing information

we have a system that provides tools to plan monitor and analyze our
promotional business and its processes on both an individual brand as well as a
corporate basis marketing and sales professionals currently utilize this system
to promote estee lauder clinique mac origins and bobbi brown products in
the united states and canada this system helps us reduce costs maintain
accountability improve return on investment and maximize the impact of our
promotional activities this system was the model for an international
promotional management system which we started installing in fiscal 2001 in
some european markets and are continuing to roll out to additional international
markets

at practically all of our international sales affiliates we have installed a
proprietary inventory management system which provides us with a global view of
finished goods availability relative to actual requirements this system has
resulted in improved inventory control and disposition for both existing product
lines and new product launches

the use of sellthrough data combined with the implementation of automated
replenishment systems data warehousing promotional planning systems and the
inventory management system has resulted in increased sales fewer
outofstocks and reduced retail inventories we expect that these systems will
continue to provide inventory and sales efficiencies

we have refined the strategic direction of our supply chain systems and have
contracted with a third party to implement its fulfillment application software
for supply chain planning and execution this software will replace our
internally developed systems on an enterprise basis we expect that the new
software systems will lead to greater efficiency and consistency in the global
supply chain by the end of fiscal 2003 we are also evaluating expanding the use
of a third partys enterprise resource planning application software to replace
the current transaction application software for financial production and
order management in north america

retailers with realtime order status throughout the procurement cycle

fulfillment process as a result we experience fewer billing discrepancies and
fewer customer deductions

states belgium switzerland the united kingdom and canada we continue to
streamline our manufacturing processes and identify sourcing opportunities to
improve innovation increase efficiencies and reduce costs our major
manufacturing facilities operate as focus plants that primarily manufacture
one type of product eg lipsticks for all of the principal brands our
plants are modern and our manufacturing processes are substantially automated

current and reasonably anticipated manufacturing requirements we continue to
identify opportunities to make significant improvements in capacity and
productivity some of our finished products are manufactured to our
specifications by third parties

the principal raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are
essential oils alcohol and specialty chemicals we also purchase packaging
components which are manufactured to our design specifications procurement of
materials for all manufacturing facilities is generally made on a global basis
through our centralized supplier relations department a concentrated effort in
supplier rationalization has been made with the specific objective of reducing
costs increasing innovation and improving quality as a result of sourcing
initiatives there is increased dependency on certain suppliers but we believe
that these suppliers have adequate resources and facilities to overcome any
unforeseen interruption of supply we are continually benchmarking the
performance of the supply chain and will add or delete suppliers based upon the
changing needs of the business we have in the past been able to obtain an
adequate supply of essential raw materials and currently believe we have
adequate sources of supply for virtually all components of our products as we
integrate acquired brands we continually seek new ways to leverage our
production and sourcing capabilities to improve manufacturing performance

competition

the skin care makeup fragrance and hair care businesses are characterized by
vigorous competition throughout the world brand recognition quality
performance and price have a significant influence on consumers choices among
competing products and brands advertising promotion merchandising the pace
and timing of new product introductions line extensions and the quality of
instore sales staff also have a significant impact on consumers buying
decisions we compete against a number of manufacturers and marketers of skin
care makeup fragrance and hair care products some of which have substantially
greater resources than we do

seasonality

our results of operations in total by region and by product category are
subject to seasonal fluctuations with net sales in the first and second fiscal
quarters typically being slightly higher than in the third and fourth fiscal
quarters the higher net sales in the first two fiscal quarters are attributable
to the increased levels of purchasing by retailers for the christmas selling
season and for fall fashion makeup introductions in addition fluctuations in
net sales operating income and product category results in any fiscal quarter
may be attributable to the level and scope of new product introductions
additionally gross margins and operating expenses are impacted on a
quarterbyquarter basis by variations in our launch calendar and the timing of

we expect to continue the payment of cash dividends in the future but there can
be no assurance that the board of directors will continue to declare dividends
in may 2002 after declaring the 05 per share dividend that was paid in july
2002 the board of directors determined that it would pay future cash dividends
on its common stock annually rather than quarterly we expect that the board of
directors will declare the first annual dividend of 20 per share in the second
quarter of fiscal 2003 and that it will be payable in january 2003

item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
        of operations

critical accounting policies and estimates


the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations
are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united
states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
liabilities revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements these
judgements can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could
differ from those estimates our most critical accounting policies relate to
revenue recognition concentration of credit risk inventory pension and other
postretirement benefit costs goodwill and other intangible assets income
taxes and derivatives

revenue recognition

generally revenues from merchandise sales are recorded at the time the product
is shipped to the customer we report our sales levels on a net sales basis
which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual returns
received and an amount established for anticipated returns

as is customary in the cosmetics industry our practice is to accept returns of
our products from retailers if properly requested authorized and approved in
accepting returns we typically provide a credit to the retailer against sales
and accounts receivable from that retailer on a dollarfordollar basis

our sales return accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct
impact on reported net sales this accrual is calculated based on a history of
gross sales and actual returns by region and product category in addition as
necessary specific accruals may be established for future known or anticipated
events as a percentage of gross sales sales returns were 49 49 and 43
in fiscal 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively

concentration of credit risk

an entity is more vulnerable to concentrations of credit risk if it is exposed
to risk of loss greater than it would have had it mitigated its risk through
diversification of customers such risks of loss manifest themselves
differently depending on the nature of the concentration and vary in
significance

we have three major customers that owned and operated retail stores that in the
aggregate accounted for approximately 120 billion or 25 of our consolidated
net sales in fiscal 2002 and 1778 million or 28 of our accounts receivable
at june 30 2002 these groups sell products primarily within north america
although management believes that these customers are sound and creditworthy a
severe adverse impact on their business operations could have a corresponding
material adverse effect on our net sales cash flows andor financial
condition

in the ordinary course of business we have established an allowance for
doubtful accounts and customer deductions in the amount of 306 million and
268 million as of june 30 2002 and 2001 respectively our allowance for
doubtful accounts is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on
reported net earnings this reserve is based upon the evaluation of accounts
receivable aging specific exposures and historical trends

inventory

we state our inventory at the lower of cost or fair market value with cost
being determined on the firstin firstout fifo method we believe fifo most
closely matches the flow of our products from manufacture through sale the
reported net value of our inventory includes saleable products promotional
products raw materials and componentry that will be sold or used in future
periods inventory cost includes raw materials direct labor and overhead

we also record an inventory obsolescence reserve which represents the
difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value
based on various product sales projections this reserve is calculated using an
estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age
historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales in addition and
as necessary we may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated
events

pension and other postretirement benefit costs

we offer the following benefits to some or all of our employees a
noncontributory defined benefit pension plan an unfunded nonqualified domestic
benefit pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations a
contributory defined contribution plan international pension plans which vary
by country the most significant of which are defined benefit pension plans
deferred compensation and certain other postretirement benefits

                                      15
page


the amounts necessary to fund future payouts under these plans are subject to
numerous assumptions and variables certain significant variables require us to
make assumptions that are within our control such as an anticipated discount
rate expected rate of return on plan assets and future compensation levels we
evaluate these assumptions with our actuarial advisors and we believe they are
within accepted industry ranges although an increase or decrease in the
assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a direct impact on
reported net earnings

for fiscal 2003 we will use a preretirement discount rate of 70 and
anticipate using an expected return on plan assets of 875 both of which will
result in a higher calculated pension expense

goodwill and other intangible assets

goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over
the value of their underlying net assets other intangible assets principally
consist of purchased royalty rights and trademarks goodwill and other
intangible assets that have an indefinite life are not amortized

on an annual basis we test goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment
to determine the fair value of these intangible assets there are many
assumptions and estimates used that directly impact the results of the testing
we have the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the
assumptions and estimates we choose to mitigate undue influence we use
industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and
approved by various levels of management additionally we evaluated our
recorded goodwill with the assistance of a thirdparty valuation firm

income taxes

we have accounted for and currently account for income taxes in accordance
with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 109 accounting
for income taxes this statement establishes financial accounting and reporting
standards for the effects of income taxes that result from an enterprises
activities during the current and preceding years it requires an asset and
liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes

as of june 30 2002 we have current net deferred tax assets of 1124 million
and noncurrent net deferred tax assets of 727 million these net deferred tax
assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization as well as the
continued application of current tax rates included in net deferred tax assets
is a valuation allowance of approximately 15 million for deferred tax assets
which relates to foreign tax loss carryforwards not utilized to date where
management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will
not be realized in the relevant jurisdiction based on our assessments no
additional valuation allowance is required if we determine that a deferred tax
asset will not be realizable an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will
result in a reduction of earnings at that time

furthermore the company provides tax reserves for federal state and
international exposures relating to audit results planning initiatives and
compliance responsibilities the development of these reserves requires
judgements about tax issues potential outcomes and timing and is a subjective
critical estimate

derivatives

we currently account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with
sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as
amended which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts and for hedging activities this statement also requires the
recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the
balance sheet and that they be measured at fair value

we currently use derivative financial instruments to hedge certain anticipated
transactions as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign
currencies we do not utilize derivatives for trading or speculative purposes
hedge effectiveness is documented assessed and monitored by our employees who
are qualified to make such assessments and monitor the instruments variables
that are external to the company such as social political and economic risks
may have an impact on our hedging program and the results thereon

fiscal 2002 as compared with fiscal 2001

net sales

net sales increased 2 or 760 million to 474 billion reflecting continued
growth in the makeup skin care and hair care categories partially offset by a
decline in fragrance net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency
translation net sales increased 3 the unusual events that occurred during the
current fiscal year and their effect on the economy particularly in the united
states have adversely impacted our business in addition the decline in
worldwide travel during most of fiscal 2002 led to a 13 reduction in our travel
retail sales sales growth from certain newer brands and recently launched
products partially offset these decreases

the following discussions of net sales by product categories and geographic
regions exclude the impact of the restructurings in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001
neither restructuring was material to our net sales and the discussions
represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business for a discussion
of the restructurings see operating expenses  restructuring and other
nonrecurring expenses in this section and under the same heading under fiscal
2001 as compared with fiscal 2000

product categories

skin care
net sales of skin care products increased 3 or 426 million to 170 billion
the net sales increase is primarily attributable to recently launched products
such as total turnaround visible skin renewer advanced night repair eye
recovery complex moisture surge extra and moisture surge eye gel a perfect
world lightsource transforming moisture lotion and cream and renutriv
ultimate lifting creme partially offsetting these increases were lower net
sales of certain existing products such as turnaround cream and resilience lift
as well as products in cliniques 3step skin care system

                                      18
page


makeup
makeup net sales increased 4 or 689 million to 179 billion newer brands
such as mac bobbi brown and stila which are primarily makeup products
contributed through growth at existing doors and increased distribution in
addition strong sales of the pure color line of products the worldwide launch
of gentle light makeup and illusionist mascara contributed positively to net
sales growth partially offsetting the increase in net sales were lower sales of
twoinone eye shadow lucidity makeup and long last soft shine lipstick

fragrance
net sales of fragrance products decreased 6 or 678 million to 102 billion
this category continued to be impacted by the softness of the fragrance business
in the united states and the decline in our travel retail business which
depends substantially on fragrance products lower net sales of beautiful estee
lauder pleasures dkny for women and certain existing tommy hilfiger licensed
products were partially offset by the recent launch of t a new fragrance in the
tommy hilfiger line and intuition for men as well as strong sales of donna
karan cashmere mist

hair care
hair care net sales increased 19 or 351 million to 2158 million this
increase was primarily the result of growth from aveda which benefited from
recently launched texture lotion products and color conserve shampoo and an
increase in the number of companyowned aveda environmental lifestyle stores
sales of bumble and bumble products increased due to an expanded product line
and an increase in the number of points of sale the results were partially
offset by lower sales from cliniques simple hair care system when compared with
the prioryear launch

the introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of
existing products which we take into account in our business planning

geographic regions

net sales in the americas increased 1 or 204 million to 288 billion the
increase is primarily due to the success of most newer brands partially offset
by economic weakness and uncertainty in the united states during most of the
fiscal year we expect uncertain economic conditions to persist into fiscal 2003
and we are planning accordingly in europe the middle east  africa net sales
increased 3 or 393 million to 126 billion this increase was primarily the
result of higher net sales in the united kingdom spain and greece where in
fiscal 2002 we formed a joint venture in which we own a controlling majority
interest with our former distributor the increase was partially offset by lower
net sales in our travel retail business which has been adversely affected by a
decrease in worldwide travel excluding the impact of our travel retail
business net sales in europe the middle east  africa increased 8 or 778
million net sales in asiapacific increased 2 or 145 million to 6106
million primarily due to higher net sales in korea and thailand as well as in
australia where we benefited from a change in retailer arrangements the
increased sales were partially offset by lower net sales in japan japan
continues to remain a difficult market due to local economic conditions and
increasing competition the challenges were made more difficult by the weakness
of the japanese yen during fiscal 2002 as compared with the us dollar
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation asiapacific net sales
increased 9

we strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market which
may account for differences in regional sales growth

cost of sales

cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales was 268 as compared with
263 in the prior year the lower margin can be attributed in part to
production volume decreases resulting in underabsorption of overhead as well
as lower than planned raw material purchases that reduced anticipated savings
from sourcing initiatives partially offsetting these negative factors were
lower sales volumes of products with a higher cost of goods particularly in
travel retail and fragrance due to variations in our launch calendar and the
timing of promotions we anticipate greater fluctuations in our gross margins
and operating expenses on a periodbyperiod basis

operating expenses

operating expenses
operating expenses increased to 660 of net sales as compared with 631 of net
sales in the prior year the increase in operating expenses primarily related to
restructuring expenses continued advertising and promotional spending and the
cost to expand and operate our retail stores the increase in operating expenses
as a percentage of net sales reflects a slower growth rate in sales than
operating expenses primarily due to economic conditions in the united states as
discussed above as part of our longterm strategies we continued to emphasize
the building of brand equities through advertising and promotional spending
and retail store expansion despite difficult economic times changes in
advertising and promotional spending result from the type timing and level of
advertising and promotional activities related to product launches and rollouts
as well as the markets being emphasized excluding the impact of restructuring
and other nonrecurring expenses operating expenses were 635 and 619 of net
sales for the fiscal years ended 2002 and 2001 respectively

restructuring and other nonrecurring expenses
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 we recorded special charges for a
restructuring related to repositioning certain businesses as part of our ongoing
efforts to drive longterm growth and increase profitability the restructuring
focused on cost reduction opportunities related to the internet our supply
chain globalization of the organization and distribution channel refinements
we have committed to a defined plan of action which resulted in an aggregate
pretax charge of 1174 million of which 594 million is cash related on an
aftertax basis the aggregate charge was 769 million equal to 32 per
diluted share as these initiatives are fully implemented we expect to generate
annual ongoing savings of about 46 million of which a portion will be
reinvested

specifically the charge included the following

o  internet in an effort to achieve strategic objectives reduce costs and
   improve profitability we outsourced glosscom platform development and
   maintenance efforts to a thirdparty provider additionally glosscom closed
   its san francisco facility and consolidated its operations in new york as a
   result included in the charge was a 239 million provision for
   restructuring the glosscom operations including benefits and severance
   packages for 36 employees as well as asset writeoffs we also took a 201
   million charge to writeoff the related glosscom acquisition goodwill

o  supply chain building on previously announced supply chain initiatives we
   have restructured certain manufacturing distribution research and
   development information systems and quality assurance operations in the
   united states canada and europe which included benefits and severance
   packages for 110 employees a charge of 237 million was recorded related to
   this effort

o  globalization of organization we continue to implement our previously
   announced transition to a global brand structure designed to streamline the
   decisionmaking process and increase innovation and speedtomarket the next
   phase of this transition entailed eliminating duplicate functions and
   responsibilities which resulted in charges for benefits and severance for
   122 employees we recorded a charge of 271 million associated with these
   efforts

o  distribution we evaluated areas of distribution relative to our financial
   targets and will focus our resources on the most productive sales channels
   and markets as a result we closed our operations in argentina and the
   remaining customers will be serviced by our chilean affiliate we are also
   closing all remaining instore tommys shops and we are closing other
   select points of distribution we recorded a 226 million provision related
   to these actions which included benefits and severance for 85 employees

following is a summary of the charges as recorded in the consolidated statement
of earnings for fiscal 2002

the restructuring charge was recorded in other accrued liabilities or where
applicable as a reduction of the related asset during fiscal 2002 93
million related to this restructuring was paid and approximately 56 million of
additional payments were made through august 31 2002 we expect to settle a
majority of the remaining obligations by the end of fiscal 2003 with certain
additional payments made ratably through fiscal 2006

operating results

operating income decreased 31 or 1542 million to 3414 million as compared
with the prior year operating margins were 72 of net sales in the current
period as compared with 106 in the prior year the decrease in operating
margin was primarily due to restructuring expenses lower than expected sales
levels increased support spending and new distribution channel costs this was
partially offset by the exclusion of amortization expense due to the adoption of
sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets in fiscal 2002 and the
november 2000 expiration of amortization related to purchased royalty rights
operating income reflected the inclusion of restructuring and other
nonrecurring expenses of 1174 million and 630 million in fiscal 2002 and
2001 respectively before consideration of the restructuring and other
nonrecurring expenses operating income decreased 18 to 4588 million and
operating margins were 97 in fiscal 2002 as compared with 119 in fiscal
2001

net earnings and net earnings per diluted share decreased approximately 37 and
39 respectively net earnings declined 1133 million to 1919 million and
net earnings per diluted share was lower by 46 per diluted share from 116 to
70 on a comparable basis before restructuring and other nonrecurring
expenses before the cumulative effect of adopting a new accounting principle
and excluding goodwill amortization in fiscal 2001 net earnings were 2894
million representing a decrease of 20 over the prior year and diluted
earnings per common share decreased 21 to 110 from 139 in the prior year

the following discussions of operating income by product categories and
geographic regions exclude the impact of restructuring and other nonrecurring
expenses and represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business

product categories
operating income decreased 79 to 134 million in fragrance 14 to 1832
million in makeup and 7 to 2484 million in skin care primarily due to lower
than anticipated sales levels coupled with continued advertising and
promotional spending to promote new and recently launched products hair care
operating income increased 5 from a smaller base to 137 million primarily
due to sales growth from aveda and bumble and bumble

geographic regions
operating income in the americas decreased 26 or 770 million to 2229
million primarily due to lower sales attributable to weakness in the us
economy and continued advertising and promotional spending in europe the
middle east  africa operating income decreased 11 or 219 million to 1799
million primarily due to the significant decrease in our travel retail
business partially offsetting the decrease were improved operating results in
italy the united kingdom spain and germany we also benefited from the
inclusion of operating results from our majorityowned joint venture in greece
in asiapacific operating income decreased slightly to 560 million due to
lower income in china and hong kong offset by higher results in korea in
australia where we benefited from a change in retailer arrangements and in
japan where we were able to reduce operating expenses

interest expense net

net interest expense was 98 million as compared with 123 million in the
prior year the decrease in net interest expense resulted from a lower effective
interest rate compared with the prior year this was primarily due to our
interest rate risk management strategy that relied on commercial paper and
variablerate term loans in january 2002 we took advantage of prevailing
market rates and issued fixed rate longterm notes to replace our variablerate
debt we believe this will mitigate future interest rate volatility but we
expect it will result in a higher level of interest expense in the near term

provision for income taxes

the companys effective tax rate will change from year to year based on
nonrecurring and recurring factors including but not limited to the
geographical mix of earnings the timing and amount of foreign dividends state
and local taxes tax audit settlements and interaction of various global tax
strategies

                                      21
page


the provision for income taxes represents federal foreign state and local
income taxes the effective rate for income taxes for fiscal 2002 was 345
compared with 36 in the prior year these rates reflect the effect of state and
local taxes changes in tax rates in foreign jurisdictions tax credits and
certain nondeductible expenses the decrease in the effective income tax rate
was attributable to ongoing tax planning initiatives as well as a decrease in
nondeductible domestic royalty expense and the elimination of certain
nondeductible goodwill amortization resulting from the implementation of sfas
no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets

fiscal 2001 as compared with fiscal 2000

net sales

net sales increased 5 or 2274 million to 467 billion reflecting continued
growth in the makeup skin care and hair care categories partially offset by a
decline in fragrance net sales the united states retail business demonstrated
continued softness particularly in the fragrance category growth on a reported
basis reflected the impact of a stronger us dollar relative to other
currencies in virtually all markets in which we do business net sales growth
was primarily attributable to a combination of new and recently launched
products the inclusion of newer brands such as bumble and bumble and changes in
distribution including additional retail locations excluding the impact of
foreign currency translation net sales increased 9 with doubledigit
contributions from each of europe the middle east  africa and asiapacific

the following discussions of net sales by product categories and geographic
regions exclude the impact of the fiscal 2001 restructuring and other
nonrecurring expenses which were not material to our net sales and represent
the manner in which we conduct and view our business for a discussion of the
restructuring and other nonrecurring expenses see operating expenses 
restructuring and other nonrecurring expenses in this section

product categories

skin care
net sales of skin care products increased 5 or 837 million to 166 billion
this increase was primarily attributable to newer products such as idealist skin
refinisher antigravity firming lift cream antigravity firming eye lift cream
and propreferred skincare products the first skin care line for our mac
brand by introducing new products into lines such as renutriv the origins
ginger bath and body collection and acne solutions we continued to attract
consumers to the lines and maintain sales momentum white light brightening
system and active white continued to be popular whitening products particularly
in the asiapacific region newly launched products such as private spa
collection origins facial skin products and initial shipments of lightsource
contributed to increased sales partially offsetting these increases were lower
sales of certain existing products such as fruition extra and diminish

makeup
makeup net sales increased 7 or 1181 million to 172 billion significant
contributors were recently launched products such as high impact eye shadow
moisture surge lipstick equalizer smart makeup lash doubling mascara
glossware pure color lip gloss luxe makeup and automatic pencil duo in
addition established products such as pure color lipstick quickliner for lips
quickliner for eyes and sheer powder blusher added to increased sales mac
products also contributed to increased sales with the eden rocks mac paints
and heat product lines

fragrance
net sales of fragrance products decreased 3 or 321 million to 109 billion
but increased 1 on a comparable currency basis the decrease in net sales was
attributable to a continued decline in sales of tommy hilfiger licensed
products as well as to lower sales of estee lauder pleasures clinique happy
and clinique happy for men the continued softness of the fragrance business in
the united states in fiscal 2001 and difficult comparisons to the prior year
contributed to the decline in this category contributing positively to the
category were new products such as intuition ginger essence and dkny for men
as well as the international rollout of dkny for women

hair care
hair care net sales increased 59 or 668 million to 1807 million the
increase in sales is attributable to the inclusion of bumble and bumble in
which we acquired a controlling majority equity interest in june 2000 and the
launch of cliniques simple hair care system in addition sales growth was
generated by aveda shampoo and conditioner products such as the sap moss and
brilliant product groups and an increase in the number of companyowned aveda
environmental lifestyle stores

page


the introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of
existing products which we take into account in our business planning

geographic regions
sales in the americas increased 5 or 1438 million to 286 billion this
increase was driven by sales growth in the makeup skin care and hair care
categories particularly with the success of new and recently launched products
and the growth of our newer brands the increase was partially offset by a
decline in fragrance sales due to the softness in this category in the united
states in europe the middle east  africa net sales increased 7 or 796
million to 122 billion the increase was primarily the result of higher net
sales in the united kingdom spain and france and in our distributor and travel
retail businesses this increase was partially offset by decreased sales in
germany and south africa net sales in asiapacific increased 2 or 120
million to 5961 million primarily due to higher net sales in korea hong kong
malaysia and thailand partially offset by lower sales in japan and australia
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation sales grew in each country
in europe the middle east  africa and in asiapacific accounting for growth
of 17 and 10 respectively

we strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market which
may account for differences in regional sales growth

cost of sales

cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales improved to 263 from 279
reflecting the impact of our manufacturing and sourcing initiatives as well as
changes in distribution and product mix changes in distribution include the
rollout of our own retail stores and the acquisition of certain distributor
operations both of which contributed to higher gross margins in addition the
synergies achieved by incorporating recently acquired businesses into our
existing manufacturing and sourcing infrastructures had a favorable impact on
gross margins

operating expenses

operating expenses
operating expenses increased to 631 of net sales as compared with 605 of net
sales in the prior year excluding the impact of restructuring and other
nonrecurring expenses operating expenses were 619 of net sales this change
primarily related to the increased cost of our retail store and internet
operations which have higher operating cost structures than our traditional
distribution channels additionally depreciation and amortization charges
increased compared with the prior year reflecting increased goodwill
amortization from acquisitions and depreciation related to capital investments
partially offset by the november 2000 expiration of amortization related to
purchased royalty rights changes in advertising and promotional spending result
from the type timing and level of advertising and promotional activities
related to product launches and rollouts as well as from the markets being
emphasized

restructuring and other nonrecurring expenses
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 we recorded onetime charges for
restructuring and other nonrecurring expenses related to repositioning certain
businesses as part of our ongoing efforts to drive longterm growth and increase
profitability the restructuring and other nonrecurring expenses focused on
four areas product fixtures for the jane brand instore tommys shops
information systems and other assets and global brand reorganization we
committed to a defined plan of action which resulted in an aggregate pretax
charge of 630 million of which 359 million is cash related on an aftertax
basis the aggregate charge was 403 million equal to 17 per diluted share

specifically the charge included the following

o  jane to bring product innovation rapidly to the market and drive growth
   jane switched from its traditional wall displays to a carded program we
   believed this change would lead to increased sales and improvements in
   profitability the positive effects on sales and improved profitability of
   this initiative were offset by the reduction in the number of points of sale
   during fiscal 2002 the charge included a 161 million writedown of
   existing jane product fixtures and the return of uncarded product from
   virtually all of the 13000 distribution outlets in the united states

o  tommys shops we also restructured the instore tommys shops to focus
   on our most productive locations and decided to close certain shops that
   underperformed relative to expectations as a result we recorded a 63

o  information systems and other assets in response to changing technology and
   our new strategic direction the charge included a 162 million provision
   for costs associated with the reevaluation of supply chain systems that we
   will no longer utilize and with the elimination of unproductive assets
   related to the change to standard financial systems

o  global brand reorganization we recorded 208 million related to benefits
   and severance packages for 75 management employees who were affected by the
   reconfiguration to a global brand structure and another 36 million related
   to infrastructure costs as of june 30 2002 none of the 75 management
   employees identified in the reorganization was still an employee we believe
   that the global brand structure is improving decisionmaking processes
   thereby increasing innovation and speed to market

following is a summary of the charges as recorded in the consolidated statement
of earnings for fiscal 2001

the restructuring charge was recorded in other accrued liabilities or as a
reduction of fixed assets during fiscal 2001 07 million was paid and through
june 30 2002 an additional 267 million was paid as of june 30 2002 the
remaining obligation was 71 million the majority of which we expect to settle
by the end of fiscal 2003 with remaining payments made ratably through fiscal
2004

operating results

operating income decreased 4 or 202 million to 4956 million as compared
with the prior year operating margins were 106 of net sales in fiscal 2001 as
compared with 116 in the prior year operating income reflected the inclusion
of restructuring and other nonrecurring expenses of 467 million and 163
million respectively before consideration of these onetime charges operating
income increased 8 to 5586 million and operating margins were 119 the
increase in operating income was primarily due to higher net sales and an
improved gross margin percentage partially offset by increased operating
expenses reflecting increased sales support spending and new distribution
channel costs

net earnings and net earnings per diluted share decreased approximately 3 net
earnings declined 89 million to 3052 million and net earnings per diluted
share was lower by 04 per diluted share from 120 to 116 net earnings
before restructuring and other nonrecurring expenses and before the cumulative
effect of adopting a new accounting principle was 3477 million representing
an increase of 11 over the prior year diluted earnings per common share
increased 12 to 134 from 120 in the prior year

the following discussions of operating income by product categories and
geographic regions exclude the impact of restructuring and other nonrecurring
expenses and represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business

product categories
operating income increased 17 to 2125 million and 11 to 2669 million in
makeup and skin care respectively due primarily to the strength of recently
launched products the strong growth of our mac business which includes
retail store expansion also contributed to the increase in makeup operating
income operating income from our fragrance business declined by 170 million
reflecting lower sales and increased support spending versus the prior year the
nominal increase in hair care operating income was a result of the inclusion of
bumble and bumble and sales from recent launches partially offset by costs
associated with refining avedas salon distribution opening new aveda
environmental lifestyle stores and investing in new product introductions

                                      24

geographic regions
operating income in the americas increased 4 or 120 million to 2999 million
as compared with the prior year primarily due to net sales increases related to
new and recently launched products strong growth in our mac business and
the inclusion of bumble and bumble partially offset by a decline in fragrance
net sales in europe the middle east  africa operating income increased 19
or 329 million to 2018 million primarily due to improved operating results
in the united kingdom and spain and in the travel retail business partially
offset by lower operating income in south africa in asiapacific operating
income decreased slightly to 569 million due to higher results in korea and
hong kong offset by lower operating income in japan and australia

interest expense net

net interest expense was 123 million as compared with 171 million in the
prior year as a result of an increase in average available cash during the
period we had higher interest income on invested funds and lower interest
expense due to reduced shortterm borrowings additionally we benefited from a
lower effective interest rate on our longterm borrowings resulting from our
interest rate risk management strategy

provision for income taxes

the provision for income taxes represents federal foreign state and local
income taxes the effective rate for income taxes for fiscal 2001 was 36
compared with 37 in the prior year these rates reflect the effect of state and
local taxes tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and certain nondeductible
expenses the decrease in the effective income tax rate was principally
attributable to ongoing tax planning initiatives

financial condition


liquidity and capital resources

our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations
and borrowings under commercial paper and committed and uncommitted credit lines
provided by banks in the united states and abroad in february 2002 we repaid
2000 million principal amount of bank borrowings with proceeds of a public
offering of 6 senior notes due 2012 6 senior notes at june 30 2002 we
had cash and cash equivalents of 5469 million compared with 3467 million at
june 30 2001

we have a 7500 million commercial paper program under which we have issued
and intend to issue commercial paper in the united states our commercial paper
is currently rated a1 by standard  poors and p1 by moodys our longterm
credit ratings are a by standard  poors and a1 by moodys at june 30 2002
our outstanding borrowings consisted of 1300 million of commercial paper
2489 million net of 11 million unamortized debt discount of 6 senior
notes due january 2012 a 7000 million yen loan payable approximately 58
million at current exchange rates which is due in april 2003 and a 30
billion yen term loan approximately 250 million at current exchange rates
which is due in march 2006 commercial paper is classified as longterm debt on
our balance sheet based upon our intent and ability to refinance maturing
commercial paper on a longterm basis it is our policy to maintain backup
facilities to support our commercial paper program and its classification as
longterm debt as of june 30 2002 we had an unused 4000 million revolving
credit facility expiring on june 28 2006 we also have an effective shelf
registration statement covering the potential issuance of up to 1500 million
in debt securities

in january 2002 we issued and sold 2500 million of 6 senior notes due 2012
in a public offering the 6 senior notes were priced at 99538 with a yield of
6062 interest payments are required to be made semiannually on january 15
and july 15 of each year we made the first payment on july 15 2002 the
primary portion of the net proceeds of the offering was used to repay a 2000
million term loan the remainder was used to repay a portion of the outstanding
commercial paper we issued these fixedrate notes in an attempt to mitigate
future interest rate volatility and capitalize on the prevailing market interest
rates then available for such longterm instruments however we do expect the
refinancing to result in a higher level of interest expense in the near term

our business is seasonal in nature and accordingly our working capital needs
vary to meet these needs we could issue up to an additional 6200 million of
commercial paper under our program issue longterm debt securities or borrow
under the revolving credit facility as of june 30 2002 we also had 229
million in unused uncommitted facilities

total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 18 at june 30 2002 as
compared with 20 at june 30 2001 primarily as a result of higher total
capital

net cash provided by operating activities was 5180 million in fiscal 2002 as
compared with 3054 million in fiscal 2001 and 4425 million in fiscal 2000
this improvement in net cash flows was generated primarily by a reduction of
inventory inventory levels were unseasonably high at the end of fiscal 2001 and
were lowered during the current fiscal year as part of our ongoing effort to
keep inventory levels in line with forecasted sales operating cash flows were
generally not impacted by the fiscal 2002 restructuring as lower net earnings
were offset by the noncash portion of the charge and the increase in other
accrued liabilities we expect the settlement of these accrued charges to result
in a lower level of cash flow provided by operating activities in fiscal 2003
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2001 as compared
to fiscal 2000 reflected an increase in inventory primarily due to accelerated
growth both in new distribution channels and in the rollout of new brands a
shift in the timing of christmas production at the end of fiscal 2001 as
compared with the prior year reconfiguration of some of our distribution to
improve service levels and softer retail sales than projected in the americas
accounts receivable increased due to sales growth particularly outside the
united states and the timing of shipments as compared with fiscal 2000 the
decrease in other accrued liabilities in fiscal 2001 reflected the type and
timing of various expenditures and the tightening of spending particularly in
the americas due to the difficult retail environment partially offset by a
352 million accrual for restructuring and other nonrecurring expenses

net cash used for investing activities was 2170 million in fiscal 2002
compared with 2063 million in fiscal 2001 and 3743 million in fiscal 2000
net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2002 is comparable to fiscal
2001 and relates primarily to capital expenditures in both periods investment
spending in fiscal 2000 reflected capital expenditures and the acquisitions of
stila jo malone glosscom and bumble and bumble as well as certain aveda
distributors

capital expenditures amounted to 2032 million 1922 million and 1809
million in fiscal 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively spending in all three years
primarily reflected the continued upgrade of manufacturing equipment dies and
molds new store openings store improvements counter construction and
information technology enhancements

cash used for financing activities was 1218 million 635 million and 879
million in fiscal 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively cash used for financing
during fiscal 2002 and 2000 primarily relates to dividend payments and common
stock repurchases the cash used in fiscal 2001 was primarily related to
dividend payments

in september 1998 our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program
we have purchased and may continue to purchase over an unspecified period of
time a total of up to eight million shares of class a common stock in the open
market or in privately negotiated transactions depending on market conditions
and other factors during fiscal 2002 we purchased 15 million shares for 497
million as of june 30 2002 we have purchased approximately 26 million shares
under this program subsequent to yearend we purchased an additional 44
million shares for 1381 million bringing the cumulative total of acquired
shares to 70 million

the board of directors declared and we paid quarterly dividends on our class a
common stock and class b common stock at the rate of 05 per share in each
quarter of fiscal 2002 2001 and 2000 in fiscal 2002 2001 and 2000 dividends
declared on our common stock totaled 475 million 477 million and 475
million respectively in may 2002 we announced that after declaring the 05
per share quarterly dividend paid on july 2 2002 the board of directors
determined that it would pay future cash dividends on its common stock annually
rather than quarterly we expect that the board of directors will declare the
first annual dividend of 20 per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2003 so
it will be payable in january 2003 accordingly we expect total dividends paid
on the common stock in fiscal 2003 to amount to 25 per share total dividends
declared including dividends on the 650 cumulative redeemable preferred
stock were 709 million 711 million and 709 million in fiscal 2002 2001
and 2000 respectively

we will be required to redeem the outstanding 650 cumulative redeemable
preferred stock on june 30 2005 however in the event that mrs estee lauder
were to pass away before such date then we would have the right to redeem the
shares from the current holders and the holders of such shares would have the
right to put the shares to us at 100 per share or an aggregate of 3600
million if shares of 650 cumulative redeemable preferred stock are put to
us we would have up to 120 days after notice to purchase such shares

the effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating
results in recent years generally we have been able to increase selling prices
sufficiently to offset cost increases which have been moderate

we believe that cash on hand cash generated from operations available credit
lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned
business operations and capital expenditures on both a nearterm and longterm
basis

derivative financial instruments

we address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk
management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments we
primarily enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign
currency options to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange
rates we categorize these instruments as entered into for purposes other than
trading

for each derivative contract we enter into we formally document the
relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item as well as its
riskmanagement objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge this process
includes linking all derivatives that are designated as fairvalue cashflow
or foreigncurrency hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance
sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions we also
formally assess both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing basis whether
the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in
offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items if it is
determined that a derivative is not highly effective then we will be required
to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively

foreign exchange risk management

we enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge anticipated transactions as
well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies for periods
consistent with our identified exposures the purpose of the hedging activities
is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on our costs and on
the cash flows that we receive from foreign subsidiaries almost all foreign
currency contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries
and are with large financial institutions rated as strong investment grade by a
major rating agency we also enter into foreign currency options to hedge
anticipated transactions where there is a high probability that anticipated
exposures will materialize the forward exchange contracts and foreign currency
options have been designated as cashflow hedges as of june 30 2002 these
cashflow hedges were highly effective in all material respects

as a matter of policy we only enter into contracts with counterparties that
have at least an a or equivalent credit rating the counterparties to these
contracts are major financial institutions we do not have significant exposure
to any one counterparty our exposure to credit loss in the event of
nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to only the recognized
but not realized gains attributable to the contracts management believes risk
of loss under these hedging contracts is remote and in any event would not be
material to the consolidated financial results the contracts have varying
maturities through the end of july 2003 costs associated with entering into
such contracts have not been material to our consolidated financial results we
do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative
purposes at june 30 2002 we had foreign currency contracts in the form of
forward exchange contracts in the amount of 2272 million the foreign
currencies included in these contracts notional value stated in us dollars
are principally the japanese yen 707 million euro 317 million british
pound 262 million australian dollar 160 million swiss franc 118
million danish krone 116 million and canadian dollar 105 million

interest rate risk management

in february 2002 we paid off our outstanding term loan which had a floating
interest rate with the proceeds from our january 2002 public debt offering of
6 senior notes as a result we terminated the interest rate swaps and options
that were previously outstanding to mitigate interest rate volatility no
material gain or loss resulted from the termination of those contracts

market risk

we use a valueatrisk model to assess the market risk of our derivative
financial instruments valueatrisk represents the potential losses for an
instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors for a specified
time period and confidence level we estimate valueatrisk across all of our
derivative financial instruments using a model with historical volatilities and
correlations calculated over the past 250 day period the measured
valueatrisk calculated as an average for the twelve months ended june 30
2002 related to our foreign exchange contracts using a variancecovariance
model with a 95 percent confidence level and assuming normal market conditions
was 100 million

our calculated valueatrisk exposure represents an estimate of reasonably
possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative
financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and
is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may or may not occur it
does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected loss that may
occur since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated
based upon actual fluctuations in market rates operating exposures and the
timing thereof and changes in the portfolio of derivative financial instruments
during the year

we believe however that any loss incurred would be offset by the effects of
market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the
hedge is intended

accounting standards

effective july 1 2001 we adopted sfas no 141 business combinations and
sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets these statements
established financial accounting and reporting standards for acquired goodwill
and other intangible assets specifically the standards address how acquired
intangible assets should be accounted for both at the time of acquisition and
after they have been recognized in the financial statements the provisions of
sfas no 141 apply to all business combinations initiated after june 30 2001
in accordance with sfas no 142 intangible assets including purchased
goodwill must be evaluated for impairment those intangible assets that will
continue to be classified as goodwill or as other intangibles with indefinite
lives are no longer amortized

in accordance with sfas no 142 we completed our transitional impairment
testing of intangible assets during the first quarter of fiscal 2002 that
effort and preliminary assessments of our identifiable intangible assets
indicated that little or no adjustment would be required upon adoption of this
pronouncement the impairment testing is performed in two steps i we
determine impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its
carrying value and ii if there is an impairment we measure the amount of
impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the
carrying amount of that goodwill subsequent to the first quarter of fiscal
2002 with the assistance of a thirdparty valuation firm we finalized the
testing of goodwill using conservative but realistic assumptions to model our
jane business we determined that the carrying value of this unit was slightly
greater than the derived fair value indicating an impairment in the recorded
goodwill to determine fair value we relied on three valuation models
guideline public companies acquisition analysis and discounted cash flow for
goodwill valuation purposes only the revised fair value of this unit was
allocated to the assets and liabilities of the business unit to arrive at an
implied fair value of goodwill based upon known facts and circumstances as if
the acquisition occurred currently this allocation resulted in a writedown of
recorded goodwill in the amount of 206 million which has been reported as the
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of july 1 2001 in
the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings on a product category
basis this writedown would have primarily impacted our makeup category

and prestigious newspapers and through direct mail and photo displays at
international airports promotional activities and instore displays are
designed to introduce existing consumers to different products in the line and
to attract new consumers our marketing efforts also benefit from cooperative
advertising programs with retailers some of which are supported by coordinated
promotions such as gift with purchase and purchase with purchase at
instore counters sales representatives offer personal demonstrations to market
individual products as well as to provide education on basic skin care and
makeup application we conduct extensive sampling programs and we pioneered
gift with purchase as a sampling program we believe that the quality and
perceived benefits of sample products have been effective inducements to
purchases by new and existing consumers

starting with the launch of the clinique website in 1996 we have used the
internet to educate and inform consumers about certain of our brands currently
there are ten singlebrandmarketing sites five of which have ecommerce
capabilities glosscom the companys majorityowned multibrand marketing and

centralized data repository of essential attributes for each of the products we
offer or plan to offer in the marketplace coupled with our product research and
development systems we are able to globally manufacture and market consistent
quality products

level at most retail sales locations ie sellthrough data this system is
currently tracking sellthrough data for almost all accounts of estee lauder

reduce costs maintain accountability improve return on investment and maximize
the impact of our promotional activities this system was the model for an
international promotional management system which we installed in fiscal 2001
in some european markets in fiscal 2002 we expect to roll this system out to
additional international markets

at practically all of our international sales affiliates we have installed a
proprietary inventory management system which provides us with a global view of
finished goods availability relative to actual requirements this system has
resulted in improved inventory control and disposition for both existing product
lines and new product launches

the use of sellthrough data combined with the implementation of automated
replenishment systems promotional planning systems and data warehousing has
resulted in increased sales fewer outofstocks and reduced retail inventories
we expect that these systems will continue to provide inventory and sales
efficiencies

we have refined the strategic direction of our supply chain systems and have
decided to evaluate best in class supply chain planning and execution software
to replace our internallydeveloped systems on an enterprise basis we expect
that the new systems we identify and install will lead to greater efficiency and
consistency in the global supply chain in the future

we continue to enhance our corporate extranet which is designed to provide
retailers with realtime order status throughout the procurement cycle
customers use this system to track their orders as they move through the
fulfillment process as a result we experience fewer billing discrepancies and
fewer customer deductions

improve innovation increase efficiencies and reduce costs our major
manufacturing facilities operate as focus plants that primarily manufacture
one type of product eg lipsticks for all of the principal brands our
plants are modern and our manufacturing processes are substantially automated

current and reasonably anticipated manufacturing requirements we continue to
identify opportunities to make significant improvements in capacity and
productivity some of our finished products are manufactured to our
specifications by third parties

essential oils alcohol and specialty chemicals we also purchase packaging
components which are manufactured to design specifications procurement of
materials for all manufacturing facilities is generally made on a global basis
through our centralized supplier relations department a concentrated effort in
supplier rationalization has been made with the specific objective of reducing
costs increasing innovation and improving quality as a result of sourcing
initiatives there is increased dependency on certain suppliers but we believe
that these suppliers have adequate resources and facilities to overcome any
unforeseen interruption of supply we have in the past been able to obtain an
adequate supply of essential raw materials and currently believe we have
adequate sources of supply for virtually all components of our products as we
integrate acquired brands we continually seek new ways to leverage our
production and sourcing capabilities to improve their manufacturing performance

administration and the federal trade commission in the united states as well as
various other federal state local and international regulatory authorities

seasonality

our results of operations in total by region and by product category are
subject to seasonal fluctuations with net sales in the first and second fiscal
quarters typically being slightly higher than in the third and fourth fiscal
quarters the higher net sales in the first two fiscal quarters are attributable
to the increased levels of purchasing by retailers for the christmas selling
season and for fall fashion makeup introductions greater variation exists in
quarterly operating income and margin which typically are lower in the second
half of the fiscal year than in the first half in addition to the effect of
lower net sales on operating income in the third and fourth fiscal quarters as
compared with the first and second fiscal quarters operating income and
operating margin in the third and fourth fiscal quarters are negatively affected
by the relatively consistent dollar amount of advertising and promotional
spending in each fiscal quarter in addition fluctuations in net sales
operating income and product category results in any fiscal quarter may be
attributable to the level and scope of new product introductions

fiscal 2001 as compared with fiscal 2000

net sales

net sales increased 6 or 2413 million to 461 billion reflecting continued
growth in the makeup skin care and hair care categories partially offset by a
decline in fragrance net sales the united states retail business has
demonstrated continued softness particularly in the fragrance category growth
on a reported basis reflects the impact of a stronger us dollar relative to
other currencies in virtually all markets in which we do business net sales
growth is primarily attributable to a combination of new and recently launched
products the inclusion of newer brands such as bumble and bumble and changes in
distribution including additional retail locations excluding the impact of
foreign currency translation net sales increased 9 with doubledigit
contributions from each of europe the middle east  africa and asiapacific

the following discussions of net sales by product categories and geographic
regions exclude the impact of the fiscal 2001 restructuring and other
nonrecurring expenses which were not material to our net sales and represent
the manner in which we conduct and view our business for a discussion of the
restructuring and other nonrecurring expenses see operating expenses 
restructuring and other nonrecurring expenses in this section

product categories

skin care net sales of skin care products increased 6 or 891 million to 164
billion this increase was primarily attributable to newer products such as
idealist skin refinisher antigravity firming lift cream antigravity firming
eye lift cream and propreferred skincare products the first skin care line for
our mac brand by introducing new products into lines such as renutriv the
origins ginger bath and body collection and acne solutions we have continued to
attract consumers to the lines and maintain sales momentum white light
brightening system and active white continue to be popular whitening products
particularly in the asiapacific region newly launched products such as private
spa collection origins facial skin products and initial shipments of
lightsource have contributed to increased sales partially offsetting these
increases were lower sales of certain existing products such as fruition extra
and diminish

                                      14
page

makeup
makeup net sales increased 8 or 1249 million to 170 billion significant
contributors were recently launched products such as high impact eye shadow
moisture surge lipstick equalizer smart makeup lash doubling mascara
glossware pure color lip gloss luxe makeup and automatic pencil duo in
addition established products such as pure color lipstick quickliner for lips
quickliner for eyes and sheer powder blusher added to increased sales mac
products have also contributed to increased sales with the eden rocks mac
paints and heat product lines

fragrance
net sales of fragrance products decreased 3 or 304 million to 106 billion
but increased 1 on a comparable currency basis the decrease in net sales is
attributable to a continued decline in sales of tommy hilfiger licensed
products as well as to lower sales of estee lauder pleasures clinique happy
and clinique happy for men the continued softness of the fragrance business in
the united states and difficult comparisons to last year contributed to the
decline in this category contributing positively to the category were new
products such as intuition ginger essence and dkny for men as well as the
international rollout of dkny for women

hair care
hair care net sales increased 59 or 668 million to 1807 million the
increase in sales is attributable to the inclusion of bumble and bumble in
which we acquired a controlling majority equity interest in june 2000 and the
launch of cliniques simple hair care system in addition sales growth was
generated by aveda shampoo and conditioner products such as the sap moss and
brilliant product groups and an increase in the number of companyowned aveda
environmental lifestyle stores

the introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of
existing products which we take into account in our business planning

geographic regions
sales in the americas increased 6 or 1565 million to 282 billion this
increase was driven by sales growth in the makeup skin care and hair care
categories particularly with the success of new and recently launched products
and the growth of our newer brands the increase was partially offset by a
decline in fragrance sales due to the softness in this category in the united
states in europe the middle east  africa net sales increased 7 or 792
million to 121 billion the increase was primarily the result of higher net
sales in the united kingdom spain and france and in our distributor and travel
retail businesses this increase was partially offset by decreased sales in
germany and south africa net sales in asiapacific increased 2 or 136
million to 5906 million primarily due to higher net sales in korea hong kong
malaysia and thailand partially offset by lower sales in japan and australia
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation sales grew in each country
in europe the middle east  africa and in asiapacific accounting for growth
of 17 and 10 respectively

we strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market which
may account for differences in regional sales growth

cost of sales

cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales improved to 211 from 223
reflecting the impact of our manufacturing and sourcing initiatives as well as
changes in distribution and product mix changes in distribution include the
rollout of our own retail stores and the acquisition of certain distributor
operations both of which contributed to higher gross margins in addition the
synergies achieved by incorporating recently acquired businesses into our
existing manufacturing and sourcing infrastructures had a favorable impact on
gross margins

operating expenses

operating expenses
operating expenses increased to 681 of net sales as compared with 659 of net
sales in the prior year excluding the impact of restructuring and other
nonrecurring expenses operating expenses were 669 of net sales this change
primarily relates to the increased cost of our retail store and internet
operations which have higher operating cost structures than our traditional
distribution channels additionally depreciation and amortization charges have
increased compared with the prior year reflecting increased goodwill
amortization from acquisitions and depreciation related to capital investments
partially offset by the november 2000 expiration of amortization related to
purchased royalty rights changes in advertising and promotional spending result
from the type timing and level of advertising and promotional activities
related to product launches and rollouts as well as the markets being
emphasized

restructuring and other nonrecurring expenses
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 we recorded onetime charges for
restructuring and other nonrecurring expenses related to repositioning certain
businesses as part of our ongoing efforts to drive longterm growth and increase
profitability the restructuring and other nonrecurring expenses focused on
four areas product fixtures for the jane brand instore tommys shops
information systems and other assets and global brand reorganization we have
committed to a defined plan of action which resulted in an aggregate pretax
charge of 630 million of which 359 million is cash related on an aftertax
basis the aggregate charge was 403 million equal to 17 per diluted share

specifically the charge included the following

1 jane to bring product innovation rapidly to the market and drive growth
jane is switching from its traditional wall displays to a carded program we
believe this change will lead to increases in sales and improvements in
profitability the charge included a 161 million writedown of existing jane
product fixtures and the return of uncarded product from virtually all of the
13000 distribution outlets in the united states

2 tommys shops we are also restructuring the instore tommys shops to
focus on our most productive locations and have decided to close certain shops
that have underperformed relative to expectations as a result we have recorded
a 63 million provision for the closing of 86 underperforming instore
tommys shops located in the united states and for related product returns

3 information systems and other assets in response to changing technology and
our new strategic direction the charge included a 162 million provision for
costs associated with the reevaluation of supply chain systems that we will no
longer utilize and with the elimination of unproductive assets related to the
change to standard financial systems we expect that these changes will enhance
efficiency and consistency throughout our global operations

4 global brand reorganization we recorded 208 million related to benefits
and severance packages for 75 management employees who were affected by the
reconfiguration to a global brand structure and another 36 million related to
infrastructure costs we expect that the global brand structure will improve
decisionmaking processes thereby increasing innovation and speed to market

following is a summary of the charges as recorded in the consolidated statement
of earnings for fiscal 2001

the restructuring charge was recorded in other accrued liabilities or as a
reduction of fixed assets during fiscal 2001 07 million was paid and through
august 31 2001 an additional 30 million was paid we expect to settle a
majority of the remaining obligations by the end of fiscal 2002 with certain
additional payments made ratably through fiscal 2004

operating results

operating income decreased 4 or 202 million to 4956 million as compared
with the prior year operating margins were 108 of net sales in fiscal 2001 as
compared with 118 in the prior year operating income reflected the inclusion
of restructuring and other nonrecurring expenses of 467 million and 163
million respectively before consideration of

                                      16
page

these onetime charges operating income increased 8 to 5586 million and
operating margins were 121 the increase in operating income was primarily due
to higher net sales and an improved gross margin percentage partially offset by
increased operating expenses reflecting increased sales support spending and new
distribution channel costs

net earnings and net earnings per diluted share decreased approximately 3 net
earnings declined 89 million to 3052 million and net earnings per diluted
share was lower by 04 per diluted share from 120 to 116 net earnings
before restructuring and other nonrecurring expenses and before the cumulative
effect of adopting a new accounting principle was 3477 million representing
an increase of 11 over the prior year diluted earnings per common share
increased 12 to 134 from 120 in the prior year

the following discussions of operating income by product categories and
geographic regions exclude the impact of restructuring and other nonrecurring
expenses and represents the manner in which we conduct and view our business

product categories
operating income increased 17 to 2125 million and 11 to 2669 million in
makeup and skin care respectively due primarily to the strength of recently
launched products the strong growth of our mac business which includes
retail store expansion also contributed to the increase in makeup operating
income operating income from our fragrance business declined by 170 million
reflecting lower sales and increased support spending versus the prior year the
nominal increase in hair care operating income was a result of the inclusion of
bumble and bumble and sales from recent launches partially offset by costs
associated with refining avedas salon distribution opening new aveda
environmental lifestyle stores and investing in new product introductions

geographic regions
operating income in the americas increased 4 or 120 million to 2999 million
as compared with the prior year primarily due to net sales increases related to
new and recently launched products strong growth in our mac business and
the inclusion of bumble and bumble partially offset by a decline in fragrance
net sales in europe the middle east  africa operating income increased 19
or 329 million to 2018 million primarily due to improved operating results
in the united kingdom and spain and in the travel retail business partially
offset by lower operating income in south africa in asiapacific operating
income decreased slightly to 569 million due to higher results in korea and
hong kong offset by lower income in japan and australia

interest expense net

net interest expense was 123 million as compared with 171 million in the
prior year as a result of an increase in average available cash during the
period we had higher interest income on invested funds and lower interest
expense due to reduced shortterm borrowings additionally we benefited from a
lower effective interest rate on our longterm borrowings resulting from our
interest rate risk management strategy

provision for income taxes

the provision for income taxes represents federal foreign state and local
income taxes the effective rate for income taxes for fiscal 2001 was 36
compared with 37 in the prior year these rates reflect the effect of state and
local taxes tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and certain nondeductible
expenses the decrease in the effective income tax rate was principally
attributable to ongoing tax planning initiatives

ebitda

earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda is an
additional measure of operating performance used by management ebitda like
operating income does not include the effects of interest and taxes and
additionally excludes the noncash effects of depreciation and amortization on
current earnings while the components of ebitda may vary from company to
company we exclude minority interest adjustments all depreciation charges
related to property plant and equipment and all amortization charges including
amortization of goodwill purchased royalty rights fully amortized in november
2000 leasehold improvements and other intangible assets these components of
operating income do not necessarily result in a capital requirement in the
current period and in the opinion of management many of the underlying
assets both tangible and intangible create value by supporting the global
recognition of brand names and product innovation and by consistently producing
quality products for our customers and consumers while we consider ebitda
useful in analyzing our results it is not intended to replace or act as a
substitute for any presentation included in the consolidated financial
statements prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles

                                      17
page

ebitda decreased slightly to 6585 million or 143 of net sales in fiscal 2001
as compared with 6626 million or 152 of net sales in fiscal 2000 excluding
restructuring and other nonrecurring expenses ebitda increased 89 to 7215
million or 156 of net sales in fiscal 2001 as compared with fiscal 2000 the
improvement in ebitda was primarily attributable to improvements in gross profit
related to sales growth and production efficiencies

fiscal 2000 as compared with fiscal 1999

net sales

net sales increased 10 or 4053 million to 437 billion reflecting
improvements in each product category and each geographic region we achieved
doubledigit growth in net sales of our makeup products both domestically and
abroad on the strength of new and existing products expanded distribution of
mac products and the addition of stila improvements in sales of skin care
products primarily related to new products targeting diverse groups of
consumers growth of hair care sales was fueled by new product introductions and
changes in our lines of distribution excluding the impact of foreign currency
translation total net sales grew 11 with doubledigit contributions from each
region

product categories

skin care
skin care product sales increased 11 or 1536 million to 155 billion
partially reflecting our ability to capitalize on the success of resilience lift
by rolling it out internationally and our introduction of a complementary
product resilience lift eye creme initial shipments of idealist skin
refinisher as well as sales of other new products such as body clinique
clinique acne solutions and spotlight skin tone perfector contributed to
improvements in the category as did a line of origins brand gingerbased
products including ginger souffle and ginger body wash sales of certain
existing products such as those in the clinique 3step skin care system were
consistently strong while others such as diminish and turnaround cream were
lower

makeup
our net sales of makeup products increased 12 or 1667 million to 158
billion supported by new and existing products the addition of stila and
increased sales of mac products sales growth of our mac lines was achieved
through growth in existing business and expansion of both traditional and retail
distribution new products launched in fiscal 2000 such as magic by
prescriptives city stick and longstemmed lashes contributed to improvements in
the category as did existing products such as long last lipstick and liquid
lipstick our makeup business also benefited from the domestic launch of go pout
lipstick and the rollout of superfit makeup and pure color lipstick
internationally improvements were partially offset by lower sales of indelible
lipstick and smudgesicles

fragrance
net sales of fragrance products increased 4 or 437 million to 109 billion
for the year sales of tommy hilfiger licensed products improved sales of
freedom for him and freedom for her which were launched in fiscal 2000
outpaced decreased sales of existing tommy hilfiger fragrances dkny for women
was launched domestically and donna karan cashmere mist was rolled out
internationally both of these products added to growth in the category in its
second full fiscal year sales of clinique happy continued to improve and during
fiscal 2000 we completed the master brand with the launch of clinique happy for
men dazzling gold and dazzling silver which were rolled out in the prior year
caused difficult comparisons for the fragrance category in fiscal 2000

hair care
sales of hair care products increased 38 or 315 million to 1139 million
primarily due to aveda driven by an increase in the number of companyowned
retail stores the successful introduction of new products and the effect of the
acquisitions of thirdparty distributors in june 2000 we acquired a majority
interest in bumble and bumble

the introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of
existing products which we take into account in our business planning

geographic regions

sales in the americas increased 11 or 2609 million to 266 billion this
increase was driven by sales of new and existing products across all categories
and growth in our newer brands in europe the middle east  africa net sales
increased 4 or 486 million to 113 billion the increase was primarily the
result of higher net sales in spain italy and france and in the travel retail
business partially offset by lower sales in germany also contributing to
regional sales growth

were sales by jo malone which was acquired in october 1999 excluding the
impact of foreign currency translation sales in europe the middle east 
africa increased 12 net sales in asiapacific increased 20 or 958 million
to 5770 million reflecting increases in all regions particularly japan
korea taiwan and australia excluding the impact of foreign currency
translation asiapacific sales grew 10 over the prioryear period

we strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market which
may account for differences in regional sales growth

cost of sales

cost of sales increased 722 million or 8 to 9721 million from 8999
million last year cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales decreased to
223 from 227 reflecting changes in product distribution as well as the
impact of our production and sourcing initiatives changes in product
distribution include the rollout of our own retail stores and the acquisition of
certain distributor operations both of which contributed to higher gross
margins in addition our cost of sales reduction program had a favorable impact
on gross margins of products offered by our newer acquisitions

operating expenses

total operating expenses increased to 659 of net sales as compared with 658
of net sales in the prior year this change primarily relates to increased costs
of newmodified channels of distribution which have higher operating cost
structures than our traditional channels as well as higher depreciation and
amortization operating expenses are subject to the timing of advertising and
promotional spending due to product launches and rollouts as well as incremental
advertising in select markets

operating income

operating income increased 13 or 589 million to 5158 million as compared
with 12 growth to 4569 million in the prior year operating margins were
118 of net sales in fiscal 2000 as compared with 115 in fiscal 1999 the
increase in operating income and margins was due to higher net sales coupled
with production efficiencies and changes in distribution partially offset by
planned increases in selling general and administrative spending related to
businesses acquired and newmodified channels of distribution

product categories
operating income increased in the skin care makeup and hair care categories by
17 15 and 9 respectively primarily due to sales growth fragrance
operating income increased 1 as strong sales increases in the early portion of
fiscal 2000 gave way to softer sales in the latter half while planned
advertising and promotional spending was relatively constant throughout the
year the advertising and promotion for fragrance indirectly supported other
categories by generating increased traffic at points of sale

geographic regions
operating income in the americas increased 9 or 229 million to 2879 million
primarily due to increases in skin care product sales as well as the inclusion
of operating results from recent acquisitions in europe the middle east 
africa operating income increased 16 or 234 million to 1689 million
reflecting improved operating results in spain and italy and in the travel
retail business in asiapacific operating income increased 27 or 126
million to 590 million due to improved results in taiwan japan korea and
australia

interest expense net

net interest expense was 171 million and 167 million for the years ended
june 30 2000 and 1999 respectively this net increase reflected lower interest
income from investments related to lower average cash balances partially
offset by lower interest expense resulting from our management of interest rates
and shortterm borrowings

provision for income taxes

the provision for income taxes represents federal foreign state and local
income taxes the effective rate for income taxes for fiscal 2000 was 37
compared with 38 in the prior year these rates were higher than the statutory
federal tax rate due to the effect of state and local taxes higher tax rates in
certain foreign jurisdictions and certain nondeductible expenses the decrease
in the effective income tax rate was principally attributable to tax planning
initiatives and reduction of certain local statutory tax rates

                                      19

ebitda

ebitda increased 15 to 6626 million or 152 of net sales in fiscal 2000 as
compared with 5742 million or 145 of net sales in fiscal 1999 the
improvement in ebitda was primarily attributable to improvements in gross profit
related to sales growth and production efficiencies

financial condition


liquidity and capital resources

our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations
and borrowings under commercial paper and committed and uncommitted credit lines
provided by banks in the united states and abroad at june 30 2001 we had cash
and cash equivalents of 3467 million compared with 3203 million at june 30
2000

we have a 7500 million commercial paper program under which we have issued
and intend to issue commercial paper in the united states our commercial paper
is currently rated a1 by standard  poors and p1 by moodys our longterm
credit ratings are a by standard  poors and a1 by moodys at june 30 2001
our outstanding longterm borrowings consisted of 1810 million of commercial
paper a 2000 million term loan which is due in february 2005 a 7000
million yen loan payable approximately 57 million at current exchange rates
which is due in april 2003 and a 30 billion yen term loan approximately 242
million at current exchange rates which is due in march 2006 commercial paper
is classified as longterm debt on our balance sheet based upon our intent and
ability to refinance maturing commercial paper on a longterm basis it is our
policy to maintain backup facilities to support our commercial paper program and
its classification as longterm debt as of june 30 2001 we had an unused
4000 million revolving credit facility expiring on june 28 2006 we also
have an effective shelf registration statement covering the potential issuance
of up to 4000 million in debt securities

our business is seasonal in nature and accordingly our working capital needs
vary to meet these needs we could issue up to an additional 5690 million of
commercial paper under our program issue longterm debt securities or borrow
under the revolving credit facility as of june 30 2001 we also had 304
million in uncommitted facilities 02 million of which was used

total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 20 at june 30 2001 as
compared with 22 at june 30 2000 primarily as a result of higher total
capital

net cash provided by operating activities was 3054 million in fiscal 2001 as
compared with 4425 million in fiscal 2000 and 3523 million in fiscal 1999
the decrease in fiscal 2001 cash provided by operating activities reflected an
increase in inventory primarily due to accelerated growth both in new
distribution channels and in the rollout of new brands a shift in the timing of
christmas production at the end of fiscal 2001 as compared with the prior year
reconfiguration of some of our distribution to improve service levels and
softer retail sales than projected in the americas accounts receivable
increased due to sales growth particularly outside the united states and the
timing of shipments as compared with fiscal 2000 the decrease in other accrued
liabilities reflected the type and timing of various expenditures and the
tightening of spending particularly in the americas due to the difficult
retail environment partially offset by a 352 million accrual for
restructuring and other nonrecurring expenses the fiscal 2000 and 1999
increases in cash provided by operating activities were primarily related to
increased earnings particularly before depreciation and amortization as well
as to higher accrual balances related to acquired businesses

net cash used for investing activities was 2063 million in fiscal 2001
compared with 3743 million in fiscal 2000 and 2003 million in fiscal 1999
during fiscal 2001 investment spending related primarily to capital
expenditures and the acquisition of a number of thirdparty distributors
investment spending in fiscal 2000 reflected capital expenditures and the
acquisitions of stila jo malone glosscom and bumble and bumble as well as
certain aveda distributors in the united states and united kingdom and certain
aveda retail stores

cash used for financing activities was 635 million 879 million and 732
million in fiscal 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively the cash used in fiscal
2001 was primarily related to dividend payments the increase in cash used in
fiscal 2000 related to common stock repurchases

in september 1998 our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program
we have purchased and may continue to purchase over an unspecified period of
time a total of up to eight million shares of class a common stock in the open
market or in privately negotiated transactions depending on market conditions
and other factors to date we have purchased approximately 11 million shares
under this program

                                      20
page

capital expenditures amounted to 1922 million 1809 million and 1179
million in fiscal 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively spending in all three years
primarily reflected the continued upgrade of manufacturing equipment dies and
molds new store openings store improvements counter construction and
information technology enhancements as well as incremental capital spending by
acquired companies

dividends declared were 711 million 709 million and 654 million in fiscal
2001 2000 and 1999 respectively in the first three quarters of fiscal 1999
the board of directors declared and we paid quarterly dividends on our class a
and class b common stock at the rate of 0425 per share the board of directors
increased the common stock dividend to 05 per share in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 1999 and declared a 05 per share dividend in each quarter of fiscal
2000 and 2001 in fiscal 2001 2000 and 1999 dividends declared on our common
stock totaled 477 million 475 million and 420 million respectively

the effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating
results in recent years generally we have been able to increase selling prices
sufficiently to offset cost increases which have been moderate

we believe that cash on hand cash generated from operations available credit
lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned
business operations and capital expenditures on both a nearterm and longterm
basis

derivative financial instruments
we address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk
management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments we
primarily enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign
currency options to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange
rates we enter into interest rate swaps and options to manage the effects of
interest rate movements on our aggregate liability portfolio we categorize
these instruments as entered into for purposes other than trading

for each derivative contract we enter into we formally document the
relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item as well as its
riskmanagement objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge this process
includes linking all derivatives that are designated as fairvalue cashflow
or foreigncurrency hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance
sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions we also
formally assess both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing basis whether
the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in
offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items if it is
determined that a derivative is not highly effective then we will be required
to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively

foreign exchange risk management
we enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge purchases receivables and
payables denominated in foreign currencies for periods consistent with our
identified exposures the purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the
effect of foreign exchange rate movements on our costs and on the cash flows
that we receive from foreign subsidiaries almost all foreign currency contracts
are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries and are with large
financial institutions rated as strong investment grade by a major rating
agency we also enter into foreign currency options to hedge anticipated
transactions where there is a high probability that anticipated exposures will
materialize the forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options have
been designated as cashflow hedges as of june 30 2001 these cashflow hedges
were highly effective in all material respects

as a matter of policy we only enter into contracts with counterparties that
have at least an a or equivalent credit rating the counterparties to these
contracts are major financial institutions we do not have significant exposure
to any one counterparty our exposure to credit loss in the event of
nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to only the recognized
but not realized gains attributable to the contracts management believes risk
of loss under these hedging contracts is remote and in any event would not be
material to the consolidated financial results the contracts have varying
maturities through the end of august 2002 costs associated with entering into
such contracts have not been material to our consolidated financial results we
do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative
purposes at june 30 2001 we had foreign currency contracts in the form of
forward exchange contracts in the amount of 1482 million the foreign
currencies included in these contracts notional value stated in us dollars
are principally the japanese yen 539 million swiss franc 288 million
korean won 185 million taiwan dollar 137 million british pound 132
million euro 85 million and mexican peso 68 million

interest rate risk management
we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement to exchange floating rate
for fixed rate interest payments periodically over the life of the agreement in
addition we have purchased interest rate options that offer similar interest
rate protection the interest rate swap and options have been designated as
cashflow hedges and were highly effective as of june 30 2001

                                      21
page
at june 30 2001 we had an interest rate swap and option agreements outstanding
with notional principal amounts of 670 million and 1330 million
respectively for the twelve month period ended june 30 2001 our interest rate
swap carried a weighted average pay rate of 614 and a receive rate of 632
the interest rate option agreements carried a weighted average pay rate of 614
and a receive rate of 662

market risk
we use a valueatrisk model to assess the market risk of our derivative
financial instruments valueatrisk represents the potential losses for an
instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors for a specified
time period and confidence level we estimate valueatrisk across all of our
derivative financial instruments using a model with historical volatilities and
correlations calculated over the past 250 day period the measured
valueatrisk calculated as an average for the twelve months ended june 30
2001 related to our foreign exchange contracts and interest rate contracts
using a variancecovariance model with a 95 percent confidence level and
assuming normal market conditions was 29 million and 30 million
respectively

our calculated valueatrisk exposure represents an estimate of reasonably
possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative
financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and
is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may or may not occur it
does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected loss that may
occur since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated
based upon actual fluctuations in market rates operating exposures and the
timing thereof and changes in the portfolio of derivative financial instruments
during the year

we believe however that any loss incurred would be offset by the effects of
market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the
hedge is intended

accounting standards

effective july 1 2000 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards
sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging
activities as amended by sfas no 138 accounting for certain derivative
instruments and certain hedging activities these statements established
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments including certain
derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities
sfas no 133 as amended requires the recognition of all derivative instruments
as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position measured
at fair value

in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 133 as amended we recorded a
noncash charge to earnings of 22 million after tax to reflect the change in
timevalue from the dates of the derivative instruments inception through the
date of transition july 1 2000 this charge is reflected as the cumulative
effect of a change in accounting principle in the accompanying consolidated
statements of earnings

the emerging issues task force eitf has reached consensus on issue no
0010 accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs this consensus
addresses how shipping and handling costs that are billed to a customer in a
sales transaction should be recognized this guidance became effective for our
fiscal 2001 fourth quarter generally we do not charge for shipping to our
customers that are retailers and accordingly the adoption of this rule did not
have a material impact on our consolidated financial results

the eitf has reached consensus on issue no 0014 accounting for certain sales
incentives this consensus addresses when sales incentives and discounts should
be recognized as well as where the related revenues and expenses should be
classified in a registrants financial statements currently the cost of
merchandise used in our giftwithpurchase and purchasewithpurchase
activities as well as any related revenues are reported net as operating
expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings upon
adoption we will classify revenues generated by these promotional activities as
sales resulting in an increase of approximately 10 to 20 in net sales the
cost of promotional merchandise will be reclassified as a cost of sales
although operating income will remain unchanged gross margins will decrease by
approximately 50 to 60 of sales offset by a corresponding decrease in
operating expenses due to variations in our launch calendar and the timing of
promotions we anticipate greater fluctuations in our gross margins and
operating expenses on a quarterbyquarter basis issue no 0014 will become
effective in our fiscal 2002 third quarter and will be applied retroactively for
purposes of comparability

the eitf has reached a consensus on issue no 0025 accounting for
consideration from a vendor to a retailer in connection with the purchase or
promotion of the vendors products the consensus provides guidance on the
income statement classification of consideration from a vendor to a retailer in
connection with the retailers purchase of the vendors products or to promote
sales of the vendors products issue no 0025 becomes effective for quarters
beginning after

                                      22
page
december 15 2001 we currently account for transactions eg certain of our
promotional allowances to retailers in accordance with issue no 0025 and
thus this consensus will not have an impact on our consolidated financial
results

in june 2001 the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 141
business combinations and sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible
assets these statements establish financial accounting and reporting standards
for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets specifically the standards
address how acquired intangible assets should be accounted for both at the time
of acquisition and after they have been recognized in the financial statements
the provisions of sfas no 141 apply to all business combinations initiated
after june 30 2001 sfas no 142 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
december 15 2001 however early application is permitted for entities with
fiscal years beginning after march 15 2001 we have adopted this standard
effective july 1 2001 and accordingly those intangible assets that will
continue to be classified as goodwill or as other intangibles with indefinite
lives will no longer be amortized this could result in the exclusion of
approximately 21 million in amortization expense for the fiscal year ending
june 30 2002 in accordance with sfas no 142 intangible assets including
purchased goodwill will be evaluated periodically for impairment our initial
evaluations are expected to be completed by september 30 2001

internet

our strategic goals for the internet are to enhance our brand equities to reach
new consumers to forge deeper relationships with existing consumers and to
strengthen our business with our traditional retailers the strategy includes
individual sites for our brands a planned launch of a multibrand website
offering products from our portfolio and specially designed sites which will be
available through the ecommerce sites of retailers who meet specific
requirements we currently have ten individual brand websites that educate and
inform consumers about specific brands with more in development five of the
existing sites  esteelaudercom cliniquecom originscom bobbibrowncom and
maccosmeticscom  have ecommerce capabilities our internet sales are
currently limited to consumers in the united states and canada we are currently
redeveloping the glosscom multibrand site we acquired in may 2000 and expect
to relaunch it in the first half of fiscal 2002 initially the site will
feature estee lauder clinique prescriptives origins bobbi brown mac and
stila products the site also will feature products from chanel inc and
clarins usa inc which became coventurers in glosscom in august 2000 the
impact of our overall internet strategy on earnings is expected to be initially
dilutive particularly as we redevelop the multibrand site

euro conversion

under the direction of the european economic and monetary union emu a single
currency the euro will replace the national currencies of most of the
european countries in which we conduct business the conversion rates between
the euro and the participating nations currencies were fixed irrevocably as of
january 1 1999 with the participating national currencies to be removed from
circulation between january 1 and june 30 2002 and replaced by euro notes and
coinage during the transition period from january 1 1999 through december
31 2001 public and private entities as well as individuals may pay for goods
and services using either checks drafts or wire transfers denominated in euros
or a participating countrys national currency

under the regulations governing the transition to a single currency there is a
no compulsion no prohibition rule which states that no one is obliged to use
the euro until the notes and coinage have been introduced on january 1 2002 in
keeping with this rule we were euro compliant able to receive
eurodenominated payments and able to invoice in euros as requested as of
january 1 1999 in the affected countries full conversion of all affected
country operations to the euro is expected to be completed by the time national
currencies are removed from circulation phased conversion to the euro is
currently underway and the effects on revenues costs and various business
strategies continue to be assessed the cost of software and business process
conversion is not expected to be material

recently issued accounting standards

the emerging issues task force eitf has reached consensus on issue no
0010 accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs this consensus
addresses how shipping and handling costs that are billed to a customer in a
sales transaction should be recognized this guidance became effective for the
companys fiscal 2001 fourth quarter generally the company does not charge for
shipping to its customers that are retailers and accordingly the adoption of
this rule did not have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial
results

the eitf has reached consensus on issue no 0014 accounting for certain sales
incentives this consensus addresses when sales incentives and discounts should
be recognized as well as where the related revenues and expenses should be
classified in the financial statements currently the cost of merchandise used
in the companys giftwithpurchase and purchasewithpurchase activities as
well as any related revenues are reported net as operating expenses in the
accompanying consolidated statements of earnings upon adoption the company
will classify revenues generated by these promotional activities as sales
resulting in an increase of approximately 10 to 20 in net sales the cost of
promotional merchandise will be reclassified as a cost of sales although
operating income will remain unchanged gross margins will decrease by
approximately 50 to 60 of sales offset by a corresponding decrease in
operating expenses due to variations in the companys launch calendar and the
timing of promotions the company anticipates greater fluctuations in its gross
margins and operating expenses on a quarterbyquarter basis issue no 0014
will become effective in the companys fiscal 2002 third quarter and will be
applied retroactively for purposes of comparability

the eitf has reached a consensus on issue no 0025 accounting for
consideration from a vendor to a retailer in connection with the purchase or
promotion of the vendors products the consensus provides guidance on the
income statement classification of consideration from a vendor to a retailer in
connection with the retailers purchase of the vendors products or to promote
sales of the vendors products issue no 0025 becomes effective for quarters
beginning after december 15 2001 the company currently accounts for
transactions eg certain promotional allowances to retailers in accordance
with issue no 0025 and thus this consensus will not have an impact on the

and other intangible assets were issued these statements establish financial
accounting and reporting standards for acquired goodwill and other intangible

effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2001 however early
application is permitted for entities with fiscal years beginning after march
15 2001 the company has adopted this standard effective july 1 2001 and
accordingly those intangible assets that will continue to be classified as
goodwill or as other intangibles with indefinite lives will no longer be
amortized this could result in the exclusion of approximately 21 million in
amortization expense for the fiscal year ending june 30 2002 in accordance
with sfas no 142 intangible assets including purchased goodwill will be
evaluated periodically for impairment the companys initial evaluations are
expected to be completed by september 30 2001

note 9  financial instruments

derivative financial instruments

the company addresses certain financial exposures through a controlled program
of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments
the company primarily enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts
and foreign currency options to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign
currency exchange rates the company enters into interest rate swaps and options
to manage the effects of interest rate movements on the companys aggregate
liability portfolio the company categorizes these instruments as entered into
for purposes other than trading

all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value on the
date the derivative contract is entered into the company designates the
derivative as i a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability
or of an unrecognized firm commitment fair value hedge ii a hedge of a
forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or
paid related to a recognized asset or liability cash flow hedge iii a
foreigncurrency fairvalue or cashflow hedge foreign currency hedge iv
a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation or v held for trading
trading instruments changes in the fair value of a derivative that is
highly effective as and that is designated and qualifies as a fairvalue
hedge along with the loss or gain on the hedged asset or liability that is
attributable to the hedged risk including losses or gains on firm commitments
are recorded in currentperiod earnings changes in the fair value of a
derivative that is highly effective as and that is designated and qualifies as
a cashflow hedge are recorded in other comprehensive income until earnings are
affected by the variability of cash flows eg when periodic settlements on a
variablerate asset or liability are recorded in earnings changes in the fair
value of derivatives that are highly effective as and that are designated and
qualify as foreigncurrency hedges are recorded in either currentperiod
earnings or other comprehensive income depending on whether the hedge
transaction is a fairvalue hedge eg a hedge of a firm commitment that is to
be settled in a foreign currency or a cashflow hedge eg a
foreigncurrencydenominated forecasted transaction if however a derivative
is used as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation its changes in
fair value to the extent effective as a hedge are recorded in accumulated
other comprehensive income within equity furthermore changes in the fair value
of derivative trading instruments are reported in currentperiod earnings

the company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and
hedged items as well as its riskmanagement objective and strategy for
undertaking various hedge transactions this process includes linking all
derivatives that are designated as fairvalue cashflow or foreigncurrency
hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific
firm commitments or forecasted transactions the company also formally assesses
both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing basis whether the derivatives
that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes
in fair values or cash flows of hedged items if it is determined that a
derivative is not highly effective or that it has ceased to be a highly
effective hedge the company will be required to discontinue hedge accounting
with respect to that derivative prospectively

foreign exchange risk management

the company enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge purchases
receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies for periods
consistent with the companys identified exposures the purpose of the hedging
activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on costs
and on the cash flows that the company receives from foreign subsidiaries
almost all foreign currency contracts are denominated in currencies of major
industrial countries and are with large financial institutions rated as strong
investment grade by a major rating agency the company also enters into foreign
currency options to hedge anticipated transactions where there is a high
probability that anticipated exposures will materialize the forward exchange
contracts and foreign currency options have been designated as cashflow hedges
as of june 30 2001 these cashflow hedges were highly effective in all
material respects

as a matter of policy the company only enters into contracts with
counterparties that have at least an a or equivalent credit rating the
counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions the company
does not have significant exposure to any one counterparty exposure to credit
loss in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is

limited to only the recognized but not realized gains attributable to the
contracts management believes risk of loss under these hedging contracts is
remote and in any event would not be material to the companys consolidated
financial results the contracts have varying maturities through the end of
august 2002 costs associated with entering into such contracts have not been
material to the companys consolidated financial results the company does not
utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes at
june 30 2001 we had foreign currency contracts in the form of forward exchange
contracts in the amount of 1482 million the foreign currencies included in
these contracts notional value stated in us dollars are principally the

contracts notional value stated in us dollars are principally the japanese
yen 802 million swiss franc 659 million british pound 171 million
euro 95 million danish krone 80 million and mexican peso 71
million

interest rate risk management

the company has entered into an interest rate swap agreement to exchange
floating rate for fixed rate interest payments periodically over the life of the
agreement in addition the company has purchased interest rate options that
offer similar interest rate protection the interest rate swap and options have
been designated as cashflow hedges and were highly effective as of june 30
2001 at june 30 2000 deferred unrealized gains from the interest rate swap
and options were 24 million and 26 million respectively

information regarding the interest rate swap and options is presented in the
following table

fair value of financial instruments

the following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of
each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that
value

         cash and cash equivalents
           the carrying amount approximates fair value primarily because of the
           short maturity of cash equivalent instruments

         longterm debt
           the fair value of the companys longterm debt was estimated based on
           the current rates offered to the company for debt with the same
           remaining maturities included in such amount is the fair value of
           the companys commercial paper and interest rate swap and option
           agreements such fair value has been determined based upon estimated
           termination costs

         cumulative redeemable preferred stock
           the fair value of the cumulative redeemable preferred stock is
           estimated utilizing a cash flow analysis at a discount rate equal to
           rates available for debt with terms similar to the preferred stock

         forward exchange contracts
           the fair value of forward exchange contracts is the estimated amount
           the company would receive or pay to terminate the agreements
