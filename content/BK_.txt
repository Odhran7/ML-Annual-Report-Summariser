many of our competitors with the particular exception of financial holding companies banks and trust companies are not subject to regulation as extensive as that described under the “mda — supervision and regulation” section in the annual report and as a result may have a competitive advantage over us and our subsidiaries in certain respects 

many broadbased financial services firms have the ability to offer a wide range of products from loans deposittaking and insurance to brokerage and asset management which may enhance their competitive position 

 

we also face intense competition in attracting and retaining qualified employees and must compete with institutions whose compensatory arrangements are not subject to the same regulatory and supervisory frameworks that apply to us for further discussion see “mda — risk factors – our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain employees” in the annual report which is incorporated herein by reference 

as part of our business strategy we seek to distinguish ourselves from competitors by the level of service we deliver to our clients we also believe that technological innovation is an important competitive factor and for this reason have made and continue to make substantial investments in this area 

the ability to maintain operations during unexpected events and to recover quickly from unexpected events is a competitive factor we continue to evaluate and strengthen our business continuity and operational resiliency capabilities and have increased our investments in technology to steadily enhance those capabilities including our ability to resume and sustain our operations

competition 

bny mellon is subject to intense competition in all aspects and areas of our business our investment management business competes with asset management firms hedge funds investment banking companies and other financial services companies including trust banks brokerage firms and insurance companies we may compete with these firms and companies domestically or internationally our investment services business competes with domestic and foreign financial services firms that offer custody services corporate trust services clearing services collateral services credit services securities brokerage foreign exchange services derivatives services depositary receipt services transfer agent services and cash management services and related products as well as a wide range of technology service providers such as financial service data processing firms competition is based on a number of factors including among others customer service quality and range of products and services offered price reputation 

interest rates lending limits and customer convenience 

many of our competitors with the particular exception of bank and financial holding companies banks and trust companies are not subject to regulation as extensive as that described under the “mda – supervision and regulation” section in the annual report and as a result may have a competitive advantage over us and our subsidiaries in certain respects 

in recent years there has been substantial consolidation among companies in the financial services industry many broadbased financial services firms now have the ability to offer a wide range of products from loans deposittaking and insurance to brokerage and asset management which may enhance their competitive position 

as part of our business strategy we seek to distinguish ourselves from competitors by the level of service we deliver to our clients we also believe that technological innovation is an important competitive factor and for this reason have made and continue to make substantial investments in this area the ability to recover quickly from unexpected events is a competitive factor and we have devoted significant resources to being able to implement this for additional discussion regarding competition see “mda – risk factors – we are subject to intense competition in all aspects of our business which could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability” in the annual report which is incorporated herein by reference

supervision and regulation 

bny mellon including through its subsidiaries engages in banking investment advisory and other securitiesrelated activities in the united states and 35 other countries we are subject to extensive regulation worldwide regulatory bodies around the world are generally charged with 

 

  

 they are not however generally charged with protecting the interests of our stockholders or creditors described below are the material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to bny mellon and its subsidiaries the descriptions are not intended to be complete changes in applicable law or regulation and in their application by regulatory agencies cannot be predicted but they may have a material effect on the business and results of bny mellon and its subsidiaries for additional discussion of recent and proposed regulatory initiatives that may impact our business see “recent accounting and regulatory developments” in the mda section in the annual report which is incorporated herein by reference 

regulatory reforms 

the events of the past few years have led to numerous new laws in the united states and internationally for financial institutions the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” or “doddfrank” which was enacted in july 2010 significantly restructures the financial regulatory regime in the united states and provides for enhanced supervision and prudential standards for among other things bhcs like bny mellon that have total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more the implications of the doddfrank act for our businesses will depend to a large extent on the manner in which rules adopted pursuant to the doddfrank act are implemented by the primary us financial 

regulatory agencies – the board of governors of the federal reserve system the “federal reserve” the fdic the office of the comptroller of the currency the “occ” the sec and the commodity futures trading commission the “cftc” – as well as potential changes in market practices and structures in response to the requirements of the doddfrank act and financial reforms in other jurisdictions among other things 

 

  

   

  

  

  

 comments on the proposed rules which we refer to as the “proposed sifi rules” are due by march 31 2012 the proposed sifi rules address a wide diverse array of regulatory areas each of which is highly complex in some cases they would implement financial regulatory requirements being proposed for the first time and in others overlap with other regulatory reforms the proposed sifi rules also address doddfrank’s early remediation requirements applicable to bhcs that have total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more the proposed remediation rules are modeled after the prompt corrective action regime described below but 

 

  

bny mellon 5 

are designed to require action beginning in the earlier stages of a company’s financial distress by mandating action on the basis of arranged triggers including capital and leverage stress test results liquidity and risk management we are analyzing the impact of the proposed sifi rules on our businesses however the full impact will not be known until the rules and other regulatory initiatives that overlap with the rules are finalized and their combined impacts can be assessed 

 

  

   

in addition to the foregoing matters the doddfrank act broadly affects the financial services industry by creating a resolution authority and through numerous other provisions aimed at strengthening the sound operation of the financial services sector as discussed further throughout this section many aspects of doddfrank are subject to further rulemaking and will take effect over several years making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on bny mellon or across the industry in addition to the discussion in this section see “risk factors – recent legislative and regulatory actions may have an adverse effect on our operations” in part i item 1a of this form 10k for additional discussion of proposed regulations that may impact our business see the “recent accounting and regulatory developments” in the mda section in the annual report which is incorporated herein by reference 

since the fall of 2008 regulators market participants and money market fund sponsors have focused on the risks that money market funds may pose to financial stability particularly to market liquidity in shortterm investments and on what possible consequences significant changes in the operations of such funds may have on the availability of shortterm funding to government and financial and commercial borrowers although amendments were effected in 2010 to rules governing money market funds designed to enhance their resilience to the possibility of “breaking the buck” additional proposals continue to be discussed these include capital support or reserves limitations on redemptions or a requirement that money market funds price their shares at net asset value it is premature to predict the outcome of these discussions and proposals but regulatory changes to the money market fund industry could cause significant business disruptions to and could materially impact the operations and profitability of this industry and bny mellon which both manages and provides services for these funds 

regulated entities of bny mellon 

bny mellon is regulated as a bhc and a financial holding company “fhc” under the bank holding company act of 1956 as amended by the 1999 financial modernization legislation known as the grammleachbliley act and by the doddfrank act the “bhc act” as such it is subject to the supervision of the federal reserve in general the bhc act limits the business of bhcs that are fhcs to banking managing or controlling banks performing certain servicing activities for subsidiaries engaging in activities that the federal

reserve has determined by order or regulation are so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto and as a result of the grammleachbliley act amendments to the bhc act engaging in any activity or acquiring and retaining the shares of any company engaged in any activity that is either 1 financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity as determined by the federal reserve in consultation with the secretary of the us treasury department or 2 complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally as solely determined by the federal reserve activities that are financial in nature include securities underwriting and dealing insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments in commercial companies 

our ability to maintain fhc status is dependent upon a number of factors including 

 

  

 an fhc that does not continue to meet all the requirements for fhc status will depending on which requirements it fails to meet lose the ability to undertake new activities or make acquisitions that are not generally permissible for bhcs without fhc status or to continue such activities for additional discussion of our well capitalized status see “capital” in the mda section in the annual report which is incorporated herein by reference 

the bank of new york mellon which is bny mellon’s largest bank subsidiary is a new york state chartered bank a member of the federal reserve system and subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve and the new york state department of financial services bny mellon’s national bank subsidiaries bny mellon na and the bank of new york mellon trust company national association are subject to primary regulation supervision and examination by the occ

 certain of our subsidiaries are registered investment advisors under the investment advisers act of 1940 as amended and as such are supervised by the sec they are also subject to various us federal and state laws and regulations and to the laws and regulations of any countries in which they conduct business these laws and regulations generally grant supervisory agencies broad administrative powers including the power to limit or restrict the carrying on of business if a regulated entity fails to comply with such laws and regulations our subsidiaries advise both public investment companies which are registered with the sec under the investment company act of 1940 the “‘40 act” including the dreyfus family of mutual funds and private investment

companies advised by our subsidiaries are qualified for sale in all states in the united states and the district of columbia except for investment companies that offer products only to residents of a particular state or of a foreign country and except for certain investment companies which are exempt from such registration or qualification new sec regulations will require additional data gathering and reporting to the sec about the operations and investment activities of private funds in order to provide the fsoc with additional market data to monitor the potential for systemic risk in the marketplace like most regulations they will increase the compliance burdens and costs for the businesses that manage these funds 

certain of our investment management trust and custody operations provide services to qualified retirement plans that are subject to the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended “erisa” which is under the jurisdiction of the us department of labor “dol” recently the dol proposed a number of new regulations that are designed to provide greater transparency to participants and beneficiaries of retirement plans and expand the definition of who is a “fiduciary” to these regulated plans being an erisa fiduciary imposes certain statutory duties liabilities disclosure obligations and restrictions related to the services being performed and fees being paid expansion of the definition of a fiduciary could require certain bny mellon businesses to modify their service model to conform to the regulations governing a fiduciary’s conduct which would likely impact the costs and profitability of such businesses 

certain of our financial services operations in the united kingdom are subject to regulation by and supervision of the financial services authority “fsa” the fsa has broad supervisory and disciplinary powers disciplinary powers include the power to temporarily or permanently revoke the authorization to carry on regulated business following a breach of uk financial services and markets act 2000 “fsma 2000” andor regulatory rules the suspension of registered employees and censures and fines for both regulated businesses and their registered employees the fsa imposes capital requirements on the entities it regulates the fsa regulates the bank of new york mellon international limited our ukchartered bank as well as the uk branches of the bank of new york mellon and the bank of new york mellon sanv in addition the fsa regulates our trust and depositary and certain of our corporate trust 

businesses certain of bny mellon’s uk incorporated subsidiaries are authorized to conduct investment business in the united kingdom pursuant to the fsma 2000 their investment management advisory activities and their sale and marketing of retail investment products are regulated by the fsa certain uk investment funds including bny mellon investment funds an openended investment company with variable capital advised by ukregulated subsidiaries of bny mellon are registered with the fsa and are offered for retail sale in the united kingdom 

our investment management business is subject to significant regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world relating to among other things the safeguarding of client assets and our management of client funds the uk and european regulatory framework is changing the uk government has announced that it intends to abolish the fsa and to establish three new regulatory bodies the financial policy committee the prudential regulation authority and the financial conduct authority in its place in addition there are various new european directives including a significant revision to the markets in financial instruments directive as well as the new alternative investment fund managers directive both of which will impact our operations 

the types of activities in which the foreign branches of our banking subsidiaries and our international subsidiaries may engage are subject to various restrictions imposed by the federal reserve those foreign branches and international subsidiaries are also subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the countries in which they operate and in the case of banking subsidiaries may be subject to regulatory capital requirements in the jurisdictions in which they operate as of dec 31 2011 each of bny mellon’s nonus banking subsidiaries had capital ratios above their specified minimum requirements 

in connection with our role as a clearing bank for the triparty repurchase transaction market or triparty repo market we work with dealers who use repos ie repurchase transactions to finance their securities by selling them to counterparties and agreeing to buy them back at a later date in triparty repos a clearing bank such as the bank of new york mellon acts as the intermediary between a dealer and its counterparty in settling the transaction and providing marktomarket and other services as a result of the recent financial crisis regulatory agencies worldwide have begun to reexamine systemic risks to various financial markets one of the markets that regulatory agencies are reviewing

and in which we participate as a clearing bank is the triparty repo market from 2009 until recently the federal reserve bank of new york sponsored a task force on triparty repo infrastructure reform to examine the risks in the triparty repo market and to decide what changes should be implemented so that such risks may be mitigated or avoided in future financial crises the task force issued recommendations regarding the triparty repo market bny mellon is working to implement the task force’s recommendations on its triparty repo business activities since may 2010 the federal reserve bank of new york has released monthly reports on the triparty repo market including information on aggregate volumes of collateral used in all triparty repo transactions by asset class concentrations and margin levels which is available at httpwwwnewyorkfedorgtripartyrepomargindatahtml 

federal reserve’s comprehensive capital assessment review 

in november 2011 the federal reserve published a final rule requiring bhcs including bny mellon with 50 billion or more of total consolidated assets to submit annual capital plans to their respective federal reserve bank the capital analysis and review process provided for in the rule is known as the comprehensive capital analysis and review or “ccar” the capital plans are required to be submitted on an annual basis such bhcs will also be required to collect and report certain related data on a quarterly basis to allow the federal reserve to monitor the companies’ progress against their annual capital plans the comprehensive capital plans which are prepared using basel i capital guidelines include a view of capital adequacy under four scenarios – a bhcdefined baseline scenario a baseline scenario provided by the federal reserve at least one bhcdefined stress scenario and a stress scenario provided by the federal reserve covered bhcs including bny mellon may pay dividends and repurchase stock only in accordance with a capital plan that has been reviewed by the federal reserve and as to which the federal reserve has not objected the rules provide that the federal reserve may object to a capital plan if the plan does not show that the covered bhc will meet all minimum regulatory capital ratios and maintain a ratio of basel i tier 1 common equity to riskweighted assets of at least 5 on a pro forma basis under expected and stressful conditions throughout the ninequarter planning horizon covered by the capital plan the rules also require among other 

things that a covered bhc may not make a capital distribution unless after giving effect to the distribution it will meet all minimum regulatory capital ratios and have a ratio of basel i tier 1 common equity to riskweighted assets of at least 5 as part of this process bny mellon also provides the federal reserve with projections covering the time period it will take us to fully comply with basel iii capital guidelines including the 7 tier 1 common equity 85 tier 1 capital and 3 leverage ratios as well as granular components of those elements as described further below under “capital requirements – basel iii” bny mellon’s most recent capital plan was filed with the federal reserve on jan 9 2012 

the purpose of the federal reserve’s capital plan review is to ensure that these bhcs have robust forwardlooking capital planning processes that account for each bhc’s unique risks and that permit continued operations during times of economic and financial stress the ccar rule consistent with prior federal reserve board guidance provides that capital plans contemplating dividend payout ratios exceeding 30 of projected aftertax net income will receive particularly close scrutiny 

the proposed sifi rules discussed earlier in this section under “regulatory reforms” would also include stress testing requirements that among other things stress test under a severely adverse scenario provided by the federal reserve it also would require a semiannual midyear stress analysis 

payment of dividends and stock repurchases 

dividend payments by bny mellon to its stockholders and stock repurchases by bny mellon are subject to the oversight of the federal reserve as described above in this section under “federal reserve’s comprehensive capital assessment review” under the ccar rule dividends and stock repurchases generally may only be paid or made under a capital plan as to which the federal reserve has not objected 

bny mellon is a legal entity separate and distinct from its bank subsidiaries and other subsidiaries dividends and interest from our subsidiaries are our principal sources of funds to make capital contributions or loans to our bank subsidiaries and other subsidiaries to pay service on our own debt to honor our guarantees of debt issued by our subsidiaries or of trust preferred securities issued by a trust or to pay dividends on our own equity securities various federal and state statutes and 

 

  

bny mellon 9 

regulations limit the amount of dividends that may 

be paid to us by our bank subsidiaries without regulatory consent if in the opinion of the applicable federal regulatory agency a depository institution under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice which depending on the financial condition of the bank could include the payment of dividends the regulator may require after notice and hearing that the bank cease and desist from such practice the occ the federal reserve and the fdic have indicated that the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice if the payment would reduce a depository institution’s capital to an inadequate level moreover under the federal deposit insurance act as amended the “fdi act” an insured depository institution may not pay any dividends if the institution is undercapitalized or if the payment of the dividend would cause the institution to become undercapitalized in addition the federal bank regulatory agencies have issued policy statements which provide that fdicinsured depository institutions and their holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of their current operating earnings 

in general the amount of dividends that may be paid by the bank of new york mellon or bny mellon na is limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under a “recent earnings” test and an “undivided profits” test under the recent earnings test a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared and paid by the entity in any calendar year exceeds the current year’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years unless the entity obtains prior regulatory approval under the undivided profits test a dividend may not be paid in excess of the entity’s “undivided profits” generally accumulated net profits that have not been paid out as dividends or transferred to surplus the ability of bny mellon’s bank subsidiaries to pay dividends to bny mellon may also be affected by various minimum capital requirements for banking organizations 

for a further discussion of restrictions on dividends see the “liquidity and dividends” section in the mda – results of operations section in the annual report and note 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report which are incorporated herein by reference further bny mellon’s right to participate in the assets or earnings of a subsidiary is subject to the prior claims of creditors of the subsidiary 

transactions with affiliates and insiders 

transactions between bny mellon’s bank subsidiaries on the one hand and bny mellon and its nonbank subsidiaries on the other are regulated by the federal reserve these regulations limit the types and amounts of transactions including loans due and extensions of credit from the us bank subsidiaries that may take place and generally require those transactions to be on an arm’slength basis these regulations generally do not apply to transactions between a us bank subsidiary and its subsidiaries in general these restrictions require that any extensions of credit by a bny mellon bank subsidiary to bny mellon or to a bny mellon nonbank subsidiary must be secured by designated amounts of specified collateral and are limited as to any one of bny mellon or such nonbank affiliates to 10 of the lending bank’s capital stock and surplus and as to bny mellon and all such nonbank affiliates in the aggregate to 20 of such lending bank’s capital stock and surplus 

the doddfrank act significantly expands the coverage and scope of the limitations on affiliate transactions within a banking organization for example commencing in july 2012 the doddfrank act requires that the 10 of capital limit on covered transactions begin to apply to financial subsidiaries commencing in july 2012 doddfrank also expands the definition of a “covered transaction” to include derivatives transactions and securities lending transactions with a nonbank affiliate under which a bank or its subsidiary has credit exposure with the term “credit exposure” to be defined by the federal reserve under its existing rulemaking authority collateral requirements will apply to such transactions as well as to certain repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements 

deposit insurance 

our us banking subsidiaries including the bank of new york mellon and bny mellon na accept deposits and those deposits have the benefit of fdic insurance up to the applicable limits the applicable limit for fdic insurance for most types of accounts is 250000 for each right and capacity of the depositor for noninterestbearing transaction accounts there is temporary unlimited coverage through december 31 2012 all funds held in noninterestbearing transaction accounts are fully insured without limit and this coverage is separate from and in addition to the coverage provided to depositors for other accounts at the bank of new 

 

  

10 bny mellon 

york mellon and bny mellon na under the fdi act insurance of deposits may be terminated by the fdic upon a finding that the insured depository institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law regulation rule order or condition imposed by a bank’s federal regulatory agency 

the fdic’s deposit insurance fund the “dif” is funded by assessments on insured depository institutions the fdic required all insured depository institutions to prepay estimated assessments for all of 2010 2011 and 2012 on december 30 2009 prior to the doddfrank act assessments were determined based on the risk category of an institution and the amount of insured deposits that it held the doddfrank act required the fdic to amend its assessment regulation so that assessments are based on the average consolidated total assets less the average tangible equity of the insured depository institution during the assessment period instead of the amount of insured deposits an institution holds the fdic implemented the doddfrank act’s provisions by establishing separate assessment systems for small institutions generally those with assets less than 10 billion and for large institutions those generally having 10 billion in assets or more both assessment systems use the new method for calculating the assessment base for smaller institutions assessments are determined based on the risk category of an institution and the assessment base for larger institutions such as the bank of new york mellon and bny mellon na assessments are determined based on camels ratings and forwardlooking financial measures to calculate the assessment rate which is subject to adjustments by the fdic and the assessment base the fdic may increase or decrease the assessment rate schedule on a semiannual basis following noticeandcomment rulemaking if required 

the doddfrank act requires the fdic to increase the reserve ratio for the dif from 115 percent in order to reach a minimum of 135 percent of estimated insured deposits by september 30 2020 the fdic issued a final rule in december 2011 setting the increased reserve ratio at 2 percent this increase may result in increased costs for our bank subsidiaries and bny mellon the doddfrank act also eliminates the ceiling 15 percent of insured deposits on the size of the dif and makes the payment of dividends from the dif by the fdic discretionary 

source of strength and liability of affiliates 

federal reserve policy historically has required bhcs to act as a source of strength to their bank subsidiaries and to commit capital and financial resources to support those subsidiaries the doddfrank act codified this policy as a statutory requirement such support may be required by the federal reserve at times when we might otherwise determine not to provide it in addition any loans by bny mellon to its bank subsidiaries would be subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of its banks in the event of a bhc’s bankruptcy any commitment by the bhc to a federal bank regulator to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment in addition in certain circumstances bny mellon’s insured depository institutions could be assessed for losses incurred by another bny mellon insured depository institution 

in the event of impairment of the capital stock of one of bny mellon’s national banks or the bank of new york mellon bny mellon as the banks’ stockholder could be required to pay such deficiency 

resolution planning 

as required by the doddfrank act the federal reserve and fdic have jointly issued a final rule that requires certain organizations including bhcs with consolidated assets of 50 billion or more to report periodically to regulators a resolution plan for their rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure bny mellon’s resolution plan must among other things ensure that our depository institution subsidiaries are adequately protected from risks arising from our other subsidiaries the final rule sets specific standards for the resolution plans including requiring a strategic analysis of the plan’s components a description of the range of specific actions the company proposes to take in resolution and a description of the company’s organizational structure material entities interconnections and interdependencies and management information systems among other elements 

in addition the fdic has issued a final rule that requires insured depository institutions with 50 billion or more in total assets such as the bank of new york mellon to submit to the fdic periodic plans for resolution in the event of the institution’s failure the rule requires these insured institutions 

 

  

bny mellon 11 

to submit a resolution plan that will enable the fdic as receiver to resolve the bank in a manner that ensures that depositors receive access to their insured deposits within one business day of the institution’s failure maximizes the netpresentvalue return from the sale or disposition of its assets and minimizes the amount of any loss to be realized by the institution’s creditors the final rule also sets specific standards for the resolution plans including requiring a strategic analysis of the plan’s components a description of the strategies for achieving the least costly resolution and analyses of the financial company’s organization material entities interconnections and interdependencies and management information systems among other elements 

the two resolution plan rules are complementary and we have commenced work on our initial resolution plans we expect that our initial plans will be required to be submitted to the regulators by early in the fourth quarter of 2012 

capital requirements 

as a bhc we are subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal reserve our bank subsidiaries are subject to similar capital requirements administered by the federal reserve in the case of the bank of new york mellon and by the occ in the case of our national bank subsidiaries bny mellon na and the bank of new york mellon trust company national association these requirements are intended to ensure that banking organizations have adequate capital given the risk levels of their assets and offbalance sheet financial instruments 

the riskbased capital guidelines currently applicable to bhcs are based on the 1988 capital accord “basel i” of the basel committee on banking supervision the “basel committee” the federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted riskbased capital guidelines for “core banks” including bny mellon based upon the revised framework for the international convergence of capital measurement and capital standards “basel ii” issued by the basel committee in june 2004 and updated in november 2005 in december 2010 the basel committee released its final framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation now officially identified by the basel committee as “basel iii” basel iii when implemented by the us banking agencies and fully 

phasedin will require bhcs and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital with a greater emphasis on common equity additional information on the calculation of our tier 1 capital total capital and riskweighted assets is set forth in “capital” in the mda – results of operations section in the annual report and additional information on our capital requirements is set forth in “recent accounting and regulatory developments” in the mda section in the annual report which are incorporated herein by reference 

basel i 

under the existing basel ibased regulations the riskbased capital ratio is determined by dividing the components of capital described further below by riskadjusted assets including certain offbalance sheet items such as standby letters of credit the regulatory capital rules state that voting common stockholders’ equity should be the predominant element within tier 1 capital and that banking organizations should avoid overreliance on noncommon equity elements riskadjusted assets are determined by classifying assets and certain offbalance sheet items into weighted categories the required minimum ratio of “total capital” the sum of “tier 1” and “tier 2” capital to riskadjusted assets is currently 8 the required minimum ratio of tier 1 capital to riskadjusted assets is 4 the riskbased capital rules state that the capital requirements are minimum standards based primarily on broad creditrisk considerations and do not take into account the other types of risk a banking organization may be exposed to  eg  interest rate market liquidity and operational risks even without further rulemaking the federal reserve may therefore set higher capital requirements for categories of banks or for an individual bank as situations warrant for example bhcs experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets other factors identified by the riskbased capital requirements as important in assessing an institution’s overall capital adequacy include concentration of credit risk and certain risks arising from nontraditional activities including the management of those risks at dec 31 2011 bny mellon’s basel i tier 1 capital to riskadjusted assets and total capital to riskadjusted assets ratios were 150 and 170 respectively 

 

  

12 bny mellon 

in addition the riskbased capital guidelines incorporate a measure for market risk in foreign exchange and commodity activities and in the trading of debt and equity instruments the market riskbased capital guidelines require banking organizations with large trading activities to maintain capital for market risk in an amount calculated by using the banking organizations’ own internal valueatrisk models subject to parameters set by the regulators in january 2011 certain of the federal banking agencies published proposed amendments to their market risk rules known as “basel ii5” intended to conform the federal banking agencies’ market risk rules more closely to the basel committee’s international standards in december 2011 in response to a doddfrank requirement that the federal banking agencies remove references to credit ratings in their rules the federal banking agencies published further proposed amendments to the market risk rules to implement that requirement those changes will result in increased capital requirements for market risk 

basel ii 

the federal banking agencies are mandating the adoption of basel ii for “core” banks having either total consolidated assets of 250 billion or more or foreign exposures of 10 billion or more such as bny mellon and its depository institution subsidiaries the us basel iibased rules for “core” banks require those banks to apply basel ii’s advanced internal ratings based “airb” approach for credit risk and advanced measurement approach “ama” for operational risk 

the us basel ii final rule became effective on april 1 2008 under the final rule 2009 was the first year for a bank to begin its first of three transitional floor periods during which banks subject to the final rule calculate their capital requirements under both the old regulations and new regulations the us basel ii rules originally provided that “core” banks would calculate their capital requirements only under the new basel iibased requirements after completion of the three transitional floor periods in the united states we began the parallel run of calculations under both the old and new guidelines in the second quarter of 2010 our capital models are currently with the federal reserve for their approval in response to a doddfrank requirement the federal banking agencies have amended their capital rules to 

provide that minimum capital as required under the basel ibased rules will act as a floor for minimum capital requirements calculated in accordance with the us basel ii rules accordingly the transition for “core” banks to calculations only under the basel iibased requirements is being eliminated 

beginning jan 1 2008 we implemented the basel ii standardized approach for our banks organized in the united kingdom belgium and luxembourg we maintain an active dialogue with us and international regulatory jurisdictions to facilitate a smooth basel ii reporting process we believe basel ii will not constrain our current business practices 

basel iii 

the basel iii final capital framework among other things

 the capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress banking institutions with a ratio of tier 1 common equity to riskweighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer or below the combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer when the latter is applied will face constraints on dividends equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall 

on july 19 2011 the basel committee issued a consultative document setting forth proposals to apply a new tier 1 common equity surcharge to certain global systemically important banks “gsibs” and on nov 4 2011 the basel committee issued final provisions substantially unchanged from the proposals in its proposed sifi rules discussed in this section under “regulatory reforms” the federal reserve indicated that it intends to propose in a separate rulemaking a tier 1 common equity surcharge for gsibs based on the basel committee’s proposal gsibs subject to the surcharge would be identified by application of a quantitative “indicatorbased approach” comprised of five broad categories of indicators – crossjurisdictional activity size interconnectedness substitutability and complexity each gsib would initially be assigned to one of four “buckets” with the capital surcharges for those buckets ranging from 1 to 25 there would be an additional 35 bucket that would initially be empty but that could be applied to a gsib that increases materially its global systemic importance in the future for example by increasing total assets the gsib equity surcharge provisions like the rest of basel iii and the doddfrank act provisions referenced above are subject to interpretation and implementation by us regulatory authorities in a companion release on nov 4 2011 addressing progress on a variety of 

financial regulatory reforms relating to global systemically important financial institutions the financial stability board released a list of 29 such institutions that included bny mellon and indicated that it used the gsib surcharge methodology in creating the list 

the implementation of the basel iii final framework will commence jan 1 2013 on that date banking institutions will be required to meet the following minimum capital ratios 

 

  

  

 the basel iii final framework provides for a number of new deductions from and adjustments to tier 1 common equity these include for example the requirement that mortgage servicing rights deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in nonconsolidated financial entities be deducted from tier 1 common equity to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10 of tier 1 common equity or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15 of tier 1 common equity 

implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to tier 1 common equity will begin on jan 1 2014 and will be phasedin over a fiveyear period 20 per year the implementation of the capital conservation buffer will begin on jan 1 2016 at 0625 and be phased in over a fouryear period increasing by that amount on each subsequent jan 1 until it reaches 25 on jan 1 2019 

the timing for the us banking agencies’ publication of proposed rules to implement the basel iii capital framework and the implementation schedule is uncertain the release accompanying the proposed sifi rules appears to indicate that rules implementing basel iii will be published for comment during the first quarter of 2012 the rules ultimately adopted and made applicable to us may be different from the basel iii final framework as published in december 2010 

impact on bny mellon 

because the us banking agencies’ rules implementing basel iii may differ from the basel iii final framework we cannot be certain of the impact the new regulations will have on our capital ratios at dec 31 2011 our basel iii ratio of tier 1 common equity to riskweighted assets was 71

leverage requirement 

basel i and basel ii do not include a leverage requirement as an international standard however even though a leverage requirement has not been an international standard in the past the federal banking agencies’ capital regulations do require bhcs and banks to comply with a minimum leverage ratio requirement basel iii will impose a leverage requirement as an international standard the federal reserve’s existing leverage ratio requirement for bhcs is that the bhc maintains a ratio of tier 1 capital to its total consolidated quarterly average assets as defined for regulatory purposes net of the loan loss reserve goodwill and certain other intangible assets the rules require a minimum leverage ratio of 3 for bhcs that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the federal reserve’s riskadjusted measure for market risk all other bhcs are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 4 also the rules indicate that the federal reserve will consider a “tangible tier 1 leverage ratio” in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities the tangible tier 1 leverage ratio is the ratio of a banking organization’s tier 1 capital excluding intangibles to total assets excluding intangibles at dec 31 2011 our leverage ratio was 52 and the leverage ratio of the bank of new york mellon was 53 

liquidity ratios under basel iii 

historically regulation and monitoring of bank and bhc liquidity has been addressed as a supervisory matter both in the united states and internationally without required formulaic measures the basel iii final framework requires banks and bhcs to measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests that although similar in some respects to liquidity measures historically applied by banks and regulators for management and supervisory purposes going forward will be required by regulation one test referred to as the liquidity coverage ratio “lcr” is designed to ensure that the banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered highquality liquid assets equal to the entity’s expected net cash outflow for a 30day time horizon or if greater 25 of its expected total cash outflow under an acute liquidity stress scenario the other referred to as the net stable funding ratio “nsfr” is designed to promote more medium and longterm funding of the assets and activities of 

banking entities over a oneyear time horizon these requirements will incentivize banking entities to increase their holdings of us treasury securities and other sovereign debt as a component of assets and increase the use of longterm debt as a funding source the basel iii liquidity framework contemplates that the lcr will be subject to an observation period continuing through mid2013 and subject to any revisions resulting from the analyses conducted and data collected during the observation period implemented as a minimum standard on jan 1 2015 similarly it contemplates that the nsfr will be subject to an observation period through mid2016 and subject to any revisions resulting from the analyses conducted and data collected during the observation period implemented as a minimum standard by jan 1 2018 

as discussed above in this section under “regulatory reforms” the proposed sifi rules address liquidity requirements for bhcs including bny mellon with 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets in the release accompanying those rules the federal reserve states a general intention to incorporate the basel iii liquidity framework for the bhcs covered by the proposed sifi rules or a “subset” of those bhcs although the proposed sifi rules do not include prescriptive ratios like the lcr and nsfr they do include detailed liquidityrelated requirements including requirements for cash flow projections liquidity stress testing including at a minimum over time horizons that include an overnight time horizon a 30day time horizon a 90day time horizon and a oneyear time horizon and a requirement that covered bhcs maintain a liquidity buffer of unencumbered highly liquid assets sufficient to meet projected net cash outflows and the projected loss or impairment of existing funding sources for 30 days over a range of liquidity stress scenarios 

prompt corrective action 

the fdi act as amended by the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 “fdicia” requires the federal banking agencies to take “prompt corrective action” in respect of depository institutions that do not meet specified capital requirements fdicia establishes five capital categories for fdicinsured banks well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized a depository institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if the banking institution has a total riskbased capital ratio of 100 or greater a 

 

  

bny mellon 15 

tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of 60 or greater and a leverage ratio of 50 or greater and the institution is not subject to an order written agreement capital directive or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific level for any capital measure the fdi act imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations management and capital distributions depending on the capital category in which an institution is classified 

at dec 31 2011 all of our bank subsidiaries were “well capitalized” based on the ratios and guidelines noted above a bank’s capital category however is determined solely for the purpose of applying the prompt corrective action rules and may not be an accurate representation of the bank’s overall financial condition or prospects 

insolvency of an insured depository institution or a bank holding company 

if the fdic is appointed as conservator or receiver for an insured depository institution such as the bank of new york mellon or bny mellon na upon its insolvency or in certain other events the fdic has the power 

 

  

  

 in addition under federal law the claims of holders of domestic deposit liabilities and certain claims for administrative expenses against an insured depository institution would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution including claims of debt holders of the institution in the “liquidation or other resolution” of such an institution by any receiver as a result whether or not the fdic ever sought to repudiate any debt obligations of the bank of new york mellon or bny mellon na the debt holders 

would be treated differently from and could receive if anything substantially less than the depositors of the bank 

the doddfrank act created a new resolution regime known as “orderly liquidation authority” for systemically important nonbank financial companies including bhcs and their affiliates under the orderly liquidation authority the fdic may be appointed as receiver for the systemically important institution and its failed nonbank subsidiaries for purposes of liquidating the entity if among other conditions it is determined at the time of the institution’s failure that it is in default or in danger of default and the failure poses a risk to the stability of the us financial system 

if the fdic is appointed as receiver under the orderly liquidation authority then the powers of the receiver and the rights and obligations of creditors and other parties who have dealt with the institution would be determined under the doddfrank act provisions and not under the insolvency law that would otherwise apply the powers of the receiver under the orderly liquidation authority were based on the powers of the fdic as receiver for depository institutions under the fdi act however the provisions governing the rights of creditors under the orderly liquidation authority were modified in certain respects to reduce disparities with the treatment of creditors’ claims under the us bankruptcy code as compared to the treatment of those claims under the new authority nonetheless substantial differences in the rights of creditors exist as between these two regimes including the right of the fdic to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims in some circumstances the use of an administrative claims procedure to determine creditors’ claims as opposed to the judicial procedure utilized in bankruptcy proceedings and the right of the fdic to transfer claims to a “bridge” entity 

the orderly liquidation authority provisions of the doddfrank act became effective upon enactment however a number of rulemakings are required under the terms of doddfrank and a number of provisions of the new authority require clarification the fdic has completed its initial phase of rulemaking under the orderly liquidation authority but additional rules are under consideration these rules may affect the manner in which the new authority is applied particularly with respect to brokerdealer and futures commission merchant subsidiaries of bhcs

depositor preference 

under federal law depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses and employee compensation against an insured depository institution are afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution including federal funds and letters of credit in the “liquidation or other resolution” of such an institution by any receiver 

antimoney laundering and the usa patriot act 

a major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions in recent years has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing the usa patriot act of 2001 the “usa patriot act” substantially broadened the scope of us antimoney laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations identifying new crimes and penalties and expanding the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the us the us treasury department has proposed and in some cases issued a number of implementing regulations which apply various requirements of the usa patriot act to financial institutions such as bny mellon’s bank brokerdealer and investment adviser subsidiaries and mutual funds and private investment companies advised or sponsored by our subsidiaries those regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies procedures and controls to detect prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers certain of those regulations impose specific due diligence requirements on financial institutions that maintain correspondent or private banking relationships with nonus financial institutions or persons failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution 

privacy 

the privacy provisions of the grammleachbliley act generally prohibit financial institutions including bny mellon from disclosing nonpublic personal financial information of consumer customers to third parties for certain purposes primarily marketing unless customers have the opportunity to “opt out” of the disclosure the fair credit reporting act restricts information sharing among affiliates for marketing purposes 

acquisitions 

federal and state laws impose notice and approval requirements for mergers and acquisitions involving depository institutions or bhcs the bhc act requires the prior approval of the federal reserve for the direct or indirect acquisition by a bhc of more than 5 of any class of the voting shares or all or substantially all of the assets of a commercial bank savings and loan association or bhc in reviewing bank acquisition and merger applications the bank regulatory authorities will consider among other things the competitive effect of the transaction financial and managerial issues including the capital position of the combined organization convenience and needs factors including the applicant’s record under the community reinvestment act of 1977 which requires us banks to help serve the credit needs of their communities including credit to low and moderate income individuals and geographies and the effectiveness of the subject organizations in combating money laundering activities in addition other acquisitions by bny mellon may be subject to informal notice and approval by the federal reserve or other regulatory authorities 

competition 

bny mellon is subject to intense competition in all aspects and areas of our business our investment management business competes with asset management firms hedge funds investment banking companies and other financial services companies including trust banks brokerage firms and insurance companies these firms and companies may be domiciled domestically or internationally our investment services business competes with domestic and foreign banks that offer institutional trust custody products and cash management products as well as a wide range of technologically capable service providers such as data processing and shareholder service firms and other firms that rely on automated data transfer services for institutional and retail customers competition is based on a number of factors including among others customer service quality and range of products and services offered price reputation interest rates lending limits and customer convenience 

many of our competitors with the particular exception of bank and financial holding companies banks and trust companies are not subject to regulation as extensive as that described under the “supervision and regulation” section of this form 10k and as a result may have a competitive advantage over us and our subsidiaries in certain respects 

 

  

bny mellon 17 

in recent years there has been substantial consolidation among companies in the financial services industry many broadbased financial services firms now have the ability to offer a wide range of products from loans deposittaking and insurance to brokerage and asset management which may enhance their competitive position 

as part of our business strategy we seek to distinguish ourselves from competitors by the level of service we deliver to our clients we also believe that technological innovation is an important competitive factor and for this reason have made and continue to make substantial investments in this area the ability to recover quickly from unexpected events is a competitive factor and we have devoted significant resources to being able to implement this for additional discussion regarding competition see part i item 1a of this form 10k “risk factors – competition – we are subject to intense competition in all aspects of our business which could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability” below which is incorporated herein by reference

 item 1a risk factors 

making or continuing an investment in securities issued by us including our common stock involves certain risks that you should carefully consider the following discussion sets forth the most significant risk factors that could affect our business financial condition or results of operations however other factors besides those discussed below or other of our reports filed with or furnished to the sec also could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations we cannot assure you that the risk factors described below or elsewhere in our reports address all potential risks that we may face these risk factors also serve to describe factors which may cause our results to differ materially from those described in forwardlooking statements included herein or in other documents or statements that make reference to this form 10k see “forwardlooking statements” 

market and economic risk—uncertainties in financial markets and weakness in the economy generally may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the domestic and global financial markets and the economy generally both in the united states and elsewhere around the world a variety of factors raise concern over the course and strength of the economic recovery including depressed home prices and increasing foreclosures volatile equity market values high unemployment governmental budget deficits including in the united states at the federal state and municipal level contagion risk from possible default by other countries on sovereign debt declining business and consumer confidence and the risk of increased inflation the resulting economic pressure on consumers and lack of confidence in the financial markets may adversely affect certain portions of our business financial condition and results of operations a worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on us and others in the financial services industry in particular we may 

face the following risks in connection with these events some of which are discussed at greater length in separate risk factors

 disruptions in european economies or the failure or instability of any of our significant counterparties in europe many of whom are major financial institutions could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

the financial markets remain concerned about the ability of certain european countries particularly greece ireland and portugal but also others such as spain and italy to finance their deficits and service growing debt burdens amidst difficult economic conditions this loss of confidence has led to rescue measures for greece ireland and portugal by eurozone countries and the international monetary fund as well as the european central bank’s intervention to stabilize italian and spanish bonds the actions required to be taken by those countries as a condition to rescue packages and by other countries to mitigate similar developments in their economies have resulted in increased political discord within and among eurozone countries we are primarily exposed to disruptions in european markets in two principal areas – on our balance sheet in certain interestbearing deposits with banks loans trading assets and investment securities as well as our investment management fee revenue relating to client investments in european assets additionally continued disruptions in europe could lead to increased client deposits and a larger balance sheet which could adversely impact our leverage ratio 

the interdependencies among european economies and financial institutions have contributed to concerns regarding the stability of european financial markets generally and certain institutions in particular financial services institutions are interdependent as a result of trading clearing 

counterparty or other relationships we routinely execute transactions with european counterparties including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients as a result defaults or nonperformance by or even rumors or questions about one or more european financial institutions or the financial markets generally have in the past led to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses by us or by other institutions in the future given the scope of our european operations clients and counterparties persistent disruptions in the european financial markets the attempt of a country to abandon the euro the failure of a significant european financial institution even if not an immediate counterparty to us or persistent weakness in the euro could have an adverse impact on our business or results of operations 

continued market volatility may adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations and our ability to manage risk 

the capital and credit markets experienced unprecedented volatility and disruption during the 2008 financial crisis under these extreme conditions our hedging and other risk management strategies may not be as effective at mitigating trading losses as they would be under less volatile market conditions further market volatility could produce downward pressure on our stock price and credit availability without regard to our underlying financial strength the broad decline in stock prices throughout the financial services industry which has also affected our common stock could require further goodwill impairment testing a substantial goodwill impairment charge would not have a significant impact on our financial condition but would have an adverse impact on our results of operations for a discussion of goodwill see “critical accounting estimates – goodwill and other intangibles” in the mda – results of operations section in the annual report severe market events have historically been difficult to predict however and we could realize significant losses if unprecedented extreme market events were to reoccur for a discussion of risk see “risk management” in the mda – results of operations section in the annual report if markets experience further upheavals there can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse effect which may be material on our ability to manage risk and on our business financial condition and results of operations

we may experience further writedowns of financial instruments that we own and other losses related to volatile and illiquid market conditions reducing our earnings 

we maintain an investment securities portfolio of various holdings types and maturities these securities are generally classified as availableforsale and consequently are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax our portfolio includes us treasury and agency securities nonagency us and nonus residential mortgagebacked securities sovereign debt commercial mortgagebacked securities municipal securities foreign covered bonds fdicinsured debt collateralized loan obligations and credit cards the values of which are subject to market price volatility to the extent unhedged this volatility affects the amount of our capital in addition if such investments suffer credit losses as we experienced with some of our investments in 2009 we may recognize in earnings the credit losses as an otherthantemporary impairment which could impact our revenue in the quarter in which we recognize the losses for example net securities losses totaled 48 billion in the third quarter of 2009 primarily as a result of a charge related to restructuring the investment securities portfolio which resulted in negative earnings per share that quarter the losses in 2009 reflected both credit and noncreditrelated losses on our investment securities portfolio we could experience losses related to our investment securities portfolio in the future which could ultimately adversely affect our results of operations and capital levels for information regarding our investment securities portfolio refer to “consolidated balance sheet review – investment securities” and for information regarding the sensitivity of and risks associated with the market value of portfolio investments and interest rates refer to the “risk management – market risk” sections both of which are in the mda – results of operations section in the annual report and note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

reputational legal and regulatory risk—our business may be negatively affected by adverse publicity regulatory actions or litigation with respect to us other wellknown companies and the financial services industry generally 

we are subject to reputational legal and regulatory risk in the ordinary course of our business 

the 2008 financial crisis and current political and public sentiment regarding financial institutions have resulted in a significant amount of adverse media coverage of financial institutions harm to our reputation can result from numerous sources including adverse publicity arising from events in the financial markets our perceived failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements the purported actions of our employees or alleged financial reporting irregularities involving ourselves or other large and wellknown companies additionally a failure to deliver appropriate standards of service and quality or a failure to appropriately describe our products and services can result in customer dissatisfaction lost revenue higher operating costs and litigation actions by the financial services industry generally or by other members of or individuals in the financial services industry can also negatively impact our reputation for example public perception that some consumers may have been treated unfairly by financial institutions has damaged the reputation of the financial services industry as a whole should any of these or other events or factors that can undermine our reputation occur there is no assurance that the additional costs and expenses that we may need to incur to address the issues giving rise to the reputational harm would not adversely affect our earnings and results of operations 

we are also the subject of inquiries investigations and proceedings by regulatory and other governmental agencies in the united states and abroad as well as the department of justice and state attorneys general responding to such investigations and lawsuits regardless of the ultimate outcome of the proceeding is timeconsuming and expensive and can divert the time and effort of our senior management from our business actions brought against us may result in lawsuits enforcement actions injunctions settlements damages fines or penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations additionally the outcome of such proceedings may be difficult to predict or estimate until late in the proceedings which may last several years any or all of these risks could result in increased regulatory supervision and affect our ability to attract and retain customers or maintain access to the capital markets adverse publicity governmental scrutiny and legal proceedings can also adversely impact the morale and performance of our employees see “legal proceedings” in note 24 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

 

  

bny mellon 23 

we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision including regulation and supervision in nonus jurisdictions which may limit our ability to pay dividends or make other capital distributions and violations of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to a comprehensive statutory and regulatory regime as well as oversight by governmental agencies in light of the current conditions in the global financial markets and economy the obama administration congress and regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry new or modified regulations and related regulatory guidance including under basel iii and the doddfrank act may have unforeseen or unintended adverse effects on the financial services industry we are required to submit to the federal reserve an annual capital plan outlining our planned capital actions for the following year our ability to take capital actions including our ability to make acquisitions declare dividends or repurchase our common stock is subject to federal reserve approval which is dependent on our successful demonstration that such actions would not adversely affect our regulatory capital position in the event of a stressed market environment for example any increase in quarterly dividends not contemplated in the annual capital plan will also require federal reserve approval the federal reserve’s current guidance provides that for large bhcs like us dividend payout ratios exceeding 30 of aftertax net income will receive particularly close scrutiny in addition the implementation of certain regulations with regard to regulatory capital could disproportionately affect our regulatory capital position relative to that of our competitors including those who may not be subject to the same regulatory requirements which could put further pressure on the price of our common stock 

failure to comply with laws regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies civil money penalties and reputational damage which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations although we have policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur if violations do occur they could damage our reputation and increase our legal and compliance costs and ultimately adversely impact our results of operations laws regulations or policies including 

accounting standards and interpretations currently affecting us and our subsidiaries may change at any time regulatory authorities may also change their interpretation of these statutes and regulations therefore our business may also be adversely affected by future changes in laws regulations policies or interpretations or regulatory approaches to compliance and enforcement see “supervision and regulation” in this form 10k 

some of the governmental authorities which may assert jurisdictional regulatory authority over us are located in and operate under jurisdictions outside the united states such jurisdictions may utilize legal principles and systems that differ from those encountered in the united states for example on various dates from 2004 to 2011 bny mellon subsidiary pershing llc was named as a defendant in more than 100 lawsuits filed in germany by plaintiffs who are investors with accounts at german brokerdealers see “legal proceedings” in note 24 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the annual report among other things litigation in foreign jurisdictions may be decided more quickly than in the united states trials may not involve testimony of witnesses who are in the courtroom and subject to crossexamination and trials may be based solely on submission of written materials these factors can make issues of regulatory compliance and legal proceedings more difficult to assess and therefore we may not be able to estimate potential exposure for a matter 

recent legislative and regulatory actions may have an adverse effect on our operations 

in july 2010 president obama signed into law the doddfrank act this law broadly affects the financial services industry particularly those entities considered to be “systemically important” such as bhcs with assets of over 50 billion including bny mellon by establishing a framework for systemic risk oversight creating a liquidation authority mandating higher capital and liquidity requirements requiring banks to pay increased fees to regulatory agencies and numerous other provisions aimed at strengthening the sound operation of the financial services sector further in july 2011 the basel committee issued a consultative document setting forth proposals to apply a new tier 1 common equity surcharge to certain gsibs and in november the financial stability board indicated that bny mellon is one of the 29 gsibs subject to this surcharge additionally in its proposed sifi rules the federal reserve indicated that it intends to propose in a separate rulemaking a tier 1 common equity surcharge for gsibs based on the basel committee’s proposal

among numerous other provisions of recent legislative and regulatory changes that could have an effect on bny mellon are 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 us regulatory agencies – banking securities and commodities – are steadily publishing notices of proposed regulations required by the doddfrank act and new bodies created by doddfrank including the fsoc and the cfpb are commencing operations the related findings of various regulatory and commission studies the interpretations issued as part of the rulemaking process and the final regulations that are issued with respect to various elements of the new law may cause changes that impact the profitability of our business activities and require that we change certain of our business practices and plans including those relating to crossselling our products and services these changes could also expose us to additional regulatory costs and require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes all of which could impact our profitability see “supervision and regulation” in 

this form 10k for additional information regarding the potential impact of the doddfrank act on our business 

interest rate environment—low or volatile interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 

our net interest revenue and cash flows are sensitive to interest rate changes and changes in valuations in the debt or equity markets over which we have no control our net interest revenue is the difference between the interest income earned on our interestearning assets such as the loans we make and the securities we hold in our investment portfolio and the interest expense incurred on our interestbearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed money we also earn net interest revenue on interestfree funds we hold 

the global market crisis has triggered a series of cuts in interest rates during fiscal 2010 and 2011 the federal open market committee kept the target federal funds rate between 0 and 025 the low interest rate environment has compressed our net interest spread and reduced our spreadbased revenues it has also resulted in the voluntary waiving of fees on certain money market mutual funds and related distribution fees by us and others in order to prevent the yields on such funds from becoming uneconomic which has an adverse impact on our revenue and results of operations 

changes in interest rates could affect the interest earned on assets differently than interest paid on liabilities a rising interest rate environment may result in our earning a larger net interest spread conversely a falling interest rate environment may result in our earning a smaller net interest spread if we are unable to effectively manage our interest rate risk it could have a material adverse effect on our profitability further rapid increases in interest rates could also trigger one or more of the following additional effects which could impact our business results of operations and financial condition

 a more detailed discussion of the interest rate and market risks we face is contained in the “risk management” section in the mda – results of operations in the annual report 

deposit insurance—deposit insurance premiums may continue to increase which could increase our costs 

during 2009 and 2010 due to a higher level of bank failures the fdic increased recurring deposit insurance premiums imposed a special assessment on insured financial institutions and required insured financial institutions to prepay three years of deposit premiums which increased our costs due to the continuing volume of bank failures it is possible that a continued high level of funding will be required from insured financial institutions such as the bank of new york mellon and bny mellon na additionally the failure by bny mellon’s bank subsidiaries to maintain its “well capitalized” status could also lead to higher fdic assessments 

competition—we are subject to intense competition in all aspects of our business which could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability 

many businesses in which we operate are intensely competitive around the world competitors include other banks trading firms broker dealers investment banks asset managers insurance companies and a variety of other financial services and advisory companies whose products and services span the local national and global markets in which we conduct operations in addition technological advances and the growth of internetbased commerce have made it possible for other types of institutions such as outsourcing companies and data processing companies to offer a variety of products and services competitive with certain areas of our business increased competition in any one or all of these areas may require us to make additional capital investments in our businesses in order to remain competitive 

furthermore pricing pressures as a result of the ability of competitors to offer comparable or improved products or services at a lower price and customer pricing reviews may result in a reduction 

in the price we can charge for our products and services which would likely negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability 

recently enacted and proposed legislation and regulation may impact our ability to conduct certain of our businesses in a costeffective manner or at all including legislation relating to restrictions on the types of activities in which financial institutions are permitted to engage such as seed capital investing this legislation and other regulations may not apply to all of our competitors which could adversely impact our ability to compete effectively a decline in our competitive position could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability and could impact our ability to attract and retain talent 

dependence on feebased business—we are dependent on feebased business for a substantial majority of our revenue and our feebased revenues could be adversely affected by a slowing in capital market activity weak financial markets or negative trends in savings rates or in individual investment preferences 

our principal operational focus is on feebased business which is distinct from commercial banking institutions that earn most of their revenues from loans and other traditional interestgenerating products and services we have redeployed our assets away from traditional retail banking to concentrate our resources further on feebased businesses such as investment management custody corporate trust depositary receipts clearing collateral management and treasury services 

fees for many of our products and services are based on the volume of transactions processed the market value of assets managed and administered securities lending volume and spreads and fees for other services rendered corporate actions crossborder investing global mergers and acquisitions activity new debt and equity issuances and secondary trading volumes all affect the level of our revenues if the volumes of these activities decrease our revenues will also decrease which would negatively impact our results of operations 

assetbased fees are typically determined on a sliding scale so that as the value of a client portfolio grows we receive a smaller percentage of the increasing value as fee income this is particularly important to our asset management global funds services and global custody businesses weak financial markets could result in reduced market 

 

  

26 bny mellon 

values in some of the assets that we manage and administer and result in a corresponding decrease in the amount of fees we receive and therefore would have an adverse effect on our results of operations similarly significant declines in the volume of capital markets activity would reduce the number of transactions we process and the amount of securities lending we do and therefore would also have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

our business generally benefits when individuals invest their savings in mutual funds and other collective funds in defined benefit plans unit investment trusts or exchange traded funds if there is a decline in the savings rates of individuals or if there is a change in investment preferences that leads to less investment in mutual funds other collective funds defined benefit plans or defined contribution plans our revenues could be adversely affected 

our feebased revenues could be adversely affected by a stable exchangerate environment or decreased crossborder investing activity 

the degree of volatility in foreign exchange rates can affect the amount of our foreign exchange trading revenue most of our foreign exchange revenue is derived from our securities servicing client base activity levels and spreads are generally higher when there is more volatility accordingly we benefit from currency volatility and our foreign exchange revenue is likely to decrease during times of decreased currency volatility 

our future revenue may increase or decrease depending upon the extent of increases or decreases in crossborder or other investments made by our clients economic and political uncertainties resulting from terrorist attacks military actions or other events including changes in laws or regulations governing crossborder transactions such as currency controls could result in decreased crossborder investment activity 

our ability to retain existing business and obtain new business is dependent on our consistent execution of the feebased services we perform 

we provide custody accounting daily pricing and administration master trust and master custody investment management trustee and recordkeeping foreign exchange securities lending securities execution and clearance correspondent clearing cash management trading and information services to clients worldwide assets under custody and assets under management are held by us in a 

custodial or fiduciary capacity and are not included in our assets if we fail to perform these services in a manner consistent with our fiduciary custodial and other obligations existing and potential clients may lose confidence in our ability to properly perform these services and our business may be adversely affected in addition any such failure may result in contingent liabilities that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or losses that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

from time to time our internal strategies and forecasts may assume a growing client base and increasing client usage of our services a decline in the pace at which we attract new clients and a decline in the pace at which existing and new clients use additional services and assign additional assets to us for management or custody would adversely affect our future results of operations a decline in the rate at which our clients outsource functions would also adversely affect our results of operations 

integration of acquisitions—our failure to successfully integrate strategic acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

from time to time to achieve our strategic objectives we have acquired or invested in other companies or businesses and may do so in the future for example on july 1 2010 we acquired global investment servicing “gis” which provides a comprehensive suite of products that includes subaccounting fund accountingadministration custody managed account services and alternative investment services we are in the process of integrating gis and other businesses that we have acquired but each of these acquisitions poses integration challenges including successfully retaining and assimilating clients and key employees capitalizing on certain revenue synergies integrating the acquired company’s accounting management information internal controls and other administrative systems and technology we may be required to spend a significant amount of time and resources to integrate these acquisitions and the anticipated benefits may take longer to achieve than projected moreover to the extent we enter into an agreement to buy or sell an entity there can be no guarantee that the transaction will close when anticipated or at all in particular in certain instances we must seek regulatory approvals before we can acquire another organization which can delay or disrupt such acquisitions if we fail to successfully integrate strategic acquisitions on a timely basis or in a cost 

 

  

bny mellon 27 

effective manner we may not meet our expectations regarding the profitability of such acquisitions which could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

counterparty risk—the failure or instability of any of our significant counterparties many of whom are major financial institutions and our assumption of credit and counterparty risk could expose us to loss and adversely affect our business 

our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties particularly with other financial institutions and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients as a result defaults or nonperformance by or even rumors or questions about one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally have in the past led to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions in the future for example as a result of our membership in several industry clearing or settlement exchanges we may be required to guarantee obligations and liabilities or provide financial support in the event that other members do not honor their obligations or default these obligations may be limited to members who dealt with the defaulting member or to the amount or a multiple of the amount of our contribution to a member’s guarantee fund or in a few cases the obligation may be unlimited the consolidation of financial service firms and the failures of other financial institutions have increased the concentration of our counterparty risk in addition our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us in addition disputes with counterparties as to the valuation of collateral significantly increase in times of market stress and illiquidity 

the degree of client demand for shortterm credit also tends to increase during periods of market turbulence exposing us to 

further counterpartyrelated risks for example investors in collective investment vehicles for which we act as custodian may engage in significant redemption activity due to adverse market or economic news that was not anticipated by the fund’s manager our relationship with our clients the nature of the settlement process and our systems may result in our extension of shortterm credit in such circumstances for some types of clients we provide credit to allow them to leverage their portfolios which may expose us to potential loss if the client experiences credit difficulties in addition to our exposure to financial institutions we are from time to time exposed to concentrated credit risk at the industry or country level potentially exposing us to a single market or political event or a correlated set of events as a consequence we may incur a loss in relation to one entity or product even though our exposure to one of its affiliates or across product types is overcollateralized moreover not all of our counterparty exposure is secured and when our exposure is secured the realizable market value of the collateral may have declined by the time we exercise rights against that collateral this risk may be particularly acute if we are required to sell the collateral into an illiquid or temporarily impaired market 

we act as agent for securities lending arrangements between customers and financial counterparties including brokerdealers wherein securities are sourced from our customers versus cash or securities posted by such financial counterparties we invest the proceeds from such securities lending transactions pursuant to certain instructions or guidelines from customers in certain cases we agree to indemnify our customers against defaults on the securities lending agreements and may have to buyin the securities with the cash collateral or the proceeds from the liquidation of the collateral in those instances we rather than our customers are exposed to the risks of the defaulting counterparty on the securities lending transaction 

although our overall business is subject to these interdependencies several of our business units are particularly sensitive to them including our currency and other trading activities our securities lending business and our investment management business there is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations

credit ratings—any material reduction in our credit ratings or the credit ratings of our subsidiaries the bank of new york mellon or bny mellon na could increase the cost of funding and borrowing to us and our rated subsidiaries and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our debt and trust preferred securities and the debt and deposits of our subsidiaries the bank of new york mellon and bny mellon na are currently rated investment grade by the major rating agencies these rating agencies regularly evaluate us and our rated subsidiaries and their outlook on us and our rated subsidiaries their credit ratings are based on a number of factors including our financial strength as well as factors not entirely within our control including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally in addition rating agencies employ different models and formulas to assess the financial strength of a rated company and from time to time rating agencies have in their discretion altered these models changes to rating agency models general economic conditions or other circumstances outside of our control could impact a rating agency’s judgment of the rating or outlook it assigns us or our rated subsidiaries in view of the difficulties experienced in recent years by many financial institutions we believe that the rating agencies may heighten their level of scrutiny may increase the frequency and scope of their credit reviews may request additional information and may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in their models for maintenance of rating levels for example in november 2011 sp revised its ratings methodology for banks which resulted in a downgrade of the debt ratings of bny mellon and our rated subsidiaries similarly in december 2011 moody’s placed the longterm ratings of bny mellon and its rated subsidiaries on review for possible downgrade and indicated that it would review bny mellon’s risk profile capital plans and earnings prospects in light of an operating environment characterized by lower interest rates greater capital markets volatility and heightened litigation risks 

moreover moody’s has indicated that regulatory changes in the doddfrank act could result in lower debt and deposit ratings for us banks and other financial institutions including us whose ratings currently benefit from assumed government support currently our ratings benefit from one notch of “lift” and the bank of new york mellon and bny mellon na benefit from two notches of “lift” as a 

result of the rating agency’s government support assumptions moody’s continues to evaluate whether to reduce its support assumptions to below prefinancial crisis levels for banks that currently benefit from ratings uplift in this context in june 2011 the rating outlook on the deposit senior debt and senior subordinated debt ratings of bny mellon and its rated subsidiaries changed to negative from stable similarly in november 2011 sp’s outlook on the debt ratings of bny mellon and its rated subsidiaries changed to negative from stable reflecting sp’s outlook on the us government rating and its assumption that our ratings enjoy one notch of “uplift” from assumed government support there can be no assurance that we or our rated subsidiaries will maintain our respective credit ratings or outlook on our securities 

a material reduction in our credit ratings or the credit ratings of our rated subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our access to credit markets the related cost of funding our credit spreads our liquidity and on certain trading revenues particularly in those businesses where counterparty creditworthiness is critical 

a material reduction in our credit ratings or the credit ratings of the bank of new york mellon or bny mellon na could affect the cost of and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding and borrowing our credit spreads which is the amount in excess of the interest rate of us treasury securities or other benchmark securities of the same maturity that we need to pay our debt investors may be impacted by our credit ratings and market perceptions of our creditworthiness in addition in connection with certain overthecounter derivatives contracts and other trading agreements counterparties may require us to provide additional collateral or to terminate these contracts and agreements and collateral financing arrangements in the event of a material credit ratings downgrade below certain ratings levels termination of these contracts and agreements could impair our liquidity by requiring us to find other sources of financing or to make significant cash payments or securities movements an increase in the costs of our funding and borrowing or an impairment of our liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take or what actions we may be required to take in response to the actions of rating agencies which may adversely affect us

supervisory standards—failure to satisfy regulatory standards including “wellcapitalized” and “wellmanaged” status or capital adequacy guidelines more generally could result in limitations on our activities and adversely affect our financial condition 

under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines and other regulatory requirements bny mellon and our subsidiary banks and brokerdealers must meet guidelines that include quantitative measures of assets liabilities and certain offbalance sheet items subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components risk weightings and other factors as discussed under “supervision and regulation” in this form 10k bny mellon is regulated as a bhc and an fhc our ability to maintain our status as an fhc is dependent upon a number of factors including our us depository institution subsidiaries qualifying on an ongoing basis as “well capitalized” and “well managed” under the banking agencies’ prompt corrective action regulations and upon bny mellon qualifying on an ongoing basis as “well capitalized” and “well managed” under applicable federal reserve regulations failure by bny mellon or one of our us bank subsidiaries to qualify as “well capitalized” and “well managed” if unremedied over a period of time would cause us to lose our status as an fhc and could affect the confidence of clients in us thus also compromising our competitive position additionally an fhc that does not continue to meet all the requirements for fhc status could lose the ability to undertake new activities or make acquisitions that are not generally permissible for bhcs without fhc status or to continue such activities during periods of market uncertainty custody customers may choose to hold cash balances instead of securities with those cash balances customarily invested in deposits of our bank subsidiaries such inflows of cash deposits could adversely impact our leverage ratio as a bhc we are subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal reserve our bank subsidiaries are subject to similar capital requirements administered by the federal reserve in the case of the bank of new york mellon and by the occ in the case of our national bank subsidiaries bny mellon na and the bank of new york mellon trust company national association failure by bny mellon or one of our us bank subsidiaries to maintain its status as “adequately capitalized” would lead to regulatory sanctions and limitations and could lead the federal banking agencies to take “prompt corrective action” furthermore failure by one of our bank subsidiaries to maintain its status as “well 

capitalized” could lead to higher fdic assessments if our company our subsidiary banks or brokerdealers failed to meet these minimum capital guidelines and other regulatory requirements we may not be able to deploy capital in the operation of our business or distribute capital to stockholders which may adversely affect our business the capital requirements applicable to us as well as to our subsidiary banks are in the process of being substantially revised in connection with basel iii and the requirements of the doddfrank act and bny mellon and our subsidiary banks will be required to satisfy additional more stringent capital adequacy standards we cannot fully predict the final form of or the effects of these regulations see “supervision and regulation” in this form 10k and the “liquidity and dividends” and “capital – capital adequacy” sections in the mda – results of operations section and the “recent accounting and regulatory developments” section in the mda section in the annual report 

access to capital markets—if our ability to access the capital markets is diminished our liquidity financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

our business is dependent in part on our ability to access successfully the capital markets on a regular basis we rely on access to both shortterm money markets and longterm capital markets as significant sources of liquidity to the extent liquidity requirements are not satisfied by the cash flow from our consolidated operations events or circumstances such as market disruptions or loss of confidence of debt purchasers or counterparties in us or in the funds markets could limit our access to capital markets increase our cost of borrowing adversely affect our liquidity or impair our ability to execute our business plan in addition our ability to raise funding could be impaired if lenders develop a negative perception of our longterm or shortterm financial prospects such negative perceptions could be developed if we incur large trading losses we are downgraded or put on or remain on negative watch by the rating agencies we suffer a decline in the level of our business activity regulatory authorities take significant action against us or we discover significant employee misconduct or illegal activity among other reasons if we are unable to raise funding using the methods described above we would likely need to finance or liquidate unencumbered assets such as our investment and trading portfolios to meet maturing liabilities we may be unable to sell some of our assets or we may have to sell assets at a discount from market value either of which could adversely affect our results of operations

monetary and other governmental policies—change or uncertainty in monetary and other governmental policies may impact our profitability and ability to compete 

the monetary tax and other policies of the government and its agencies including the federal reserve have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance for example the federal reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states and its policies determine in large part our cost of funds for lending investing and capital raising activities and the return we earn on those loans and investments both of which affect our net interest margin the actions of the federal reserve also can materially affect the value of financial instruments we hold and its policies also can affect our borrowers potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans due to current market conditions we anticipate that tax and other government policies will become more rigorous heightened regulatory scrutiny and increased sanctions changes or potential changes in domestic and international legislation and regulation as well as domestic or international regulatory investigations impose compliance legal review and response costs that may impact our profitability and may allow additional competition facilitate consolidation of competitors or attract new competitors into our businesses the cost of geographically diversifying and maintaining our facilities to comply with regulatory mandates necessarily results in additional costs our business and earnings are also affected by the fiscal or other policies that are adopted by various us regulatory authorities nonus governments and international agencies changes in domestic and international fiscal and monetary policies are beyond our control and difficult to predict and we cannot determine the ultimate effect that any such changes would have upon our financial condition or operations see “supervision and regulation” in this form 10k 

operational risk—our business may be adversely affected by operational risk 

we are exposed to operational risk as a result of conducting various feebased services including certain securities servicing global payment services private banking and asset management services examples of operational risk include the risk of loss resulting from errors related to transaction 

processing breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements fraud by employees or persons outside bny mellon business interruption due to system failures natural disasters or other unforeseeable events or other risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes people and systems or from external events operational risk may also include breaches of our technology and information systems resulting from unauthorized access to confidential information or from internal or external threats such as cyber attacks operational risk also includes potential legal or regulatory actions that could arise as a result of noncompliance with applicable laws regulatory requirements or contracts which could have an adverse effect on our reputation we regularly assess and monitor operational risk in our business and provide for disaster and business recovery planning including geographical diversification of our facilities however the occurrence of various events including unforeseeable and unpreventable events such as systems failures or natural disasters could damage our physical facilities or our computer systems or software cause delay or disruptions to operational functions impair our clients vendors and counterparties and ultimately negatively impact our results of operations due to potentially higher expenses and lower revenues for a discussion of operational risk see “risk management – operational risk” in the mda – results of operations section in the annual report 

a failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures any system of controls however well designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system are met any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition if we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are otherwise required to restate our financial statements we could be required to implement expensive and timeconsuming remedial measures and could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports 

 

  

bny mellon 31 

if our information systems experience a disruption or breach in security that results in a loss of confidential client information or impacts our ability to provide services to our clients our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 

we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business the security of our computer systems software and networks and those functions that we may outsource may be vulnerable to breaches hacker attacks unauthorized access and misuse computer viruses and other cybersecurity risks and events that could result in failures or disruptions in our business customer relationship management general ledger deposit and loan systems our businesses that rely heavily on technology such as our investment services business are particularly vulnerable to security breaches and technology disruptions breaches of security may occur through intentional or unintentional acts by those having authorized or unauthorized access to our or our clients’ or counterparties’ confidential information including employees and customers as well as hackers a breach of security that results in the loss of confidential client information may require us to reimburse clients for data and credit monitoring efforts and would be costly and timeconsuming and may negatively impact our results of operations and reputation additionally security breaches or disruptions of our information system could impact our ability to provide services to our clients which could expose us to liability for damages result in the loss of customer business damage our reputation subject us to regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition the failure to upgrade or maintain our computer systems software and networks as necessary could also make us susceptible to breaches and unauthorized access and misuse there can be no assurance that any such failures interruptions or security breaches will not occur or if they do occur that they will be adequately addressed we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify investigate or remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures arising from information systems security risks for a discussion of operational risk see “risk management – operational risk” in the mda – results of operations section in the annual report 

technology—we depend on our technology and intellectual property if third parties misappropriate our intellectual property our business may be adversely affected 

we are dependent on technology because many of our products and services involve processing large volumes of data our technology platforms must therefore provide global capabilities and scale rapid technological changes require significant and ongoing investments in technology to develop competitive new products and services or adopt new technologies technological advances which result in lower transaction costs may adversely impact our revenues in addition unsuccessful implementation of technological upgrades and new products may adversely impact our ability to service and retain customers 

developments in the securities processing industry including shortened settlement cycles and straightthroughprocessing will necessitate ongoing changes to our business and operations and will likely require additional investment in technology our financial performance depends in part on our ability to develop and market new and innovative services to adopt or develop new technologies that differentiate our products or provide cost efficiencies and to deliver these products and services to the market in a timely manner at a competitive price 

rapid technological change in the financial services industry together with competitive pressures require us to make significant and ongoing investments we cannot provide any assurance that our technology spending will achieve gains in competitiveness or profitability and the costs we incur in product development could be substantial accordingly we could incur substantial development costs without achieving corresponding gains in profitability 

furthermore if a third party were to assert a claim of infringement or misappropriation of its proprietary rights obtained through patents or otherwise against us with respect to one or more of our methods of doing business or conducting our operations we could be required to spend significant amounts to defend such claims develop alternative methods of operations pay substantial money damages or obtain a license from the third party

global operations—we are subject to political economic legal operational and other risks that are inherent in operating globally and which may materially adversely affect our business 

in conducting our business and maintaining and supporting our global operations we are subject to risks of loss from the outbreak of hostilities and various unfavorable political economic legal or other developments including social or political instability changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks expropriation nationalization confiscation of assets price controls capital controls exchange controls and changes in laws and regulations our international businesses are regulated in the jurisdictions in which they are located or operate these regulations may apply heightened scrutiny to nondomestic companies which can reduce our flexibility as to intercompany transactions investments and other aspects of business operations and adversely affect our liquidity profitability and regulatory capital the failure of our systems of internal control to properly mitigate such risks or of its operating infrastructure to support such international activities could result in operational failures and regulatory fines or sanctions which could cause our earnings or stock price to decline further our businesses and operations from time to time enter into new regions throughout the world including emerging markets various emerging market countries have experienced severe economic and financial disruptions including significant devaluations of their currencies defaults or threatened defaults on sovereign debt capital and currency exchange controls and low or negative growth rates in their economies crime corruption war or military actions and a lack of an established legal and regulatory framework are additional challenges in certain emerging markets revenue from international operations and trading in nonus securities and other obligations may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above considerations the possible effects of any of these conditions may adversely affect our business and increase volatility in global financial markets generally 

acts of terrorism and global conflicts—acts of terrorism and global conflicts may have a negative impact on our business and operations 

acts of terrorism and global conflicts could have a significant impact on our business and operations while we have in place business continuity and disaster recovery plans acts of terrorism and global 

conflicts could still damage our facilities disrupt or delay the normal operations of our business including communications and technology result in harm or cause travel limitations on our employees and have a similar impact on our clients suppliers and counterparties acts of terrorism and global conflicts could also negatively impact the purchase of our products and services to the extent that those acts or conflicts result in reduced capital markets activity lower asset price levels or disruptions in general economic activity in the united states or abroad or in financial market settlement functions war terror attacks political unrest global conflicts the national and global efforts to combat terrorism and other potential military activities and outbreaks of hostilities have affected and may further negatively impact economic growth which could have an adverse effect on our business and operations and may have other adverse effects on us in ways that we are unable to predict 

new business—new lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks 

from time to time we may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business there are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts in developing and marketing new lines of business andor new products and services we may invest significant time and resources initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business andor new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible as we develop new lines of business or new products or services our revenues and costs may fluctuate because generally new businesses require startup expenses but take time for revenues to develop as a result of the uncertainties associated with the entry into new businesses our business may be adversely impacted 

attraction and retention of employees—our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain employees 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract new employees retain and motivate our existing employees and continue to compensate our employees competitively amid intense public and regulatory scrutiny of the compensation practices of large financial institutions competition for the best employees in most activities in which we engage can be intense and there can be no assurance that we 

 

  

bny mellon 33 

will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain key personnel factors that affect our ability to attract and retain key employees include our compensation and benefits programs and our reputation for rewarding and promoting qualified employees our ability to attract and retain key executives and other employees may be hindered as a result of regulations applicable to incentive compensation and other aspects of our compensation programs promulgated by the federal reserve and other regulators in the united states and worldwide regulations on incentive compensation to be promulgated by various us regulators pursuant to the doddfrank act and other existing and potential regulations these regulations which include and are expected to include mandatory deferral and clawback requirements do not and will not apply to some of our competitors and to other institutions with which we compete for talent our ability to recruit and retain key talent may be adversely affected by these regulations 

tax laws and regulations—tax law changes or challenges to our tax positions with respect to historical transactions may adversely affect our net income effective tax rate and our overall results of operations and financial condition 

in the course of our business we receive inquiries from both us and nonus tax authorities on the amount of taxes we owe such as those matters discussed in notes 13 and 24 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report if we are not successful in defending these inquiries we may be required to adjust the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions all of which can require a greater provision for taxes or otherwise negatively affect earnings probabilities and outcomes are reviewed as events unfold and adjustments to the reserves are made when necessary but the reserves may prove inadequate because we cannot necessarily accurately predict the outcome of any challenge settlement or litigation or to what extent it will negatively affect us or our business in addition changes in tax legislation or the interpretation of existing tax laws worldwide could have a material impact on our net income 

accounting principles—changes in accounting standards could have a material impact on our financial statements 

from time to time the financial accounting standards board the international accounting standards board the sec and bank regulators 

change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of our financial statements such as the potential adoption of international financial reporting standards in some cases we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in our restating prior period financial statements see “recent accounting and regulatory developments” in the mda section in the annual report these changes are difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations and other financial data 

credit reserves—we could incur income statement charges if our reserves for credit losses including loan reserves are inadequate 

we have credit exposure to residential mortgages the financial airline and automotive industries monoline financial guaranty insurers and many other industries we cannot provide any assurance as to whether chargeoffs related to these sectors or to different credit risks may occur in the future though credit risk is inherent in lending activities our revenues and profitability are adversely affected when our borrowers default in whole or in part on their loan obligations to us we rely on statistical models and our business experience to estimate future defaults which we use to create loan loss reserves against our loan portfolio in addition current market developments may increase default and delinquency rates which may impact our chargeoffs we cannot provide any assurance that these reserves based on management estimates will not be required to be augmented due to an unexpectedly high level of defaults if reserves for credit losses are not sufficient we would be required to record a larger credit loss reserve against current earnings 

holding company risks—we are a nonoperating holding company and as a result are dependent on dividends from our subsidiaries including our subsidiary banks to meet our obligations including our obligations with respect to our debt securities and to provide funds for payment of dividends to our stockholders 

we are a nonoperating holding company whose principal assets and sources of income are our principal bank subsidiaries – the bank of new york mellon and bny mellon na – and our other subsidiaries we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our banks and other subsidiaries and therefore we rely primarily on dividends and 

 

  

34 bny mellon 

interest from these banking and other subsidiaries to meet our obligations including our obligations with respect to our debt securities and to provide funds for payment of dividends to our stockholders to the extent declared by our board of directors there are various legal limitations on the extent to which these banking and other subsidiaries can finance or otherwise supply funds to us by dividend or otherwise and certain of our affiliates 

although we maintain cash positions for liquidity at the holding company level if these banking subsidiaries or other of our subsidiaries were unable to supply us with cash over time we could be unable to meet our obligations including our obligations with respect to our debt securities or declare or pay dividends in respect of our capital stock see “supervision and regulation – payment of dividends and stock repurchases” in this form 10k the “liquidity and dividends” section in the mda – results of operations section and note 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

because we are a holding company our rights and the rights of our creditors including the holders of our debt securities to a share of the assets of any subsidiary upon the liquidation or recapitalization of the subsidiary will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors including in the case of our banking subsidiaries their depositors except to the extent that we may ourselves be a creditor with recognized claims against the subsidiary the rights of holders of our debt securities to benefit from those distributions will also be junior to those prior claims consequently our debt securities will be effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries a holder of our debt securities should look only to our assets for payments in respect of those debt securities 

our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and may be limited by the federal reserve or applicable provisions of delaware law 

holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock we are not required to do so any increase in bny mellon’s ongoing quarterly dividend would require approval from the federal reserve any reduction of or the elimination of our common stock dividend in the 

future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

delaware law—antitakeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage a change of control that our stockholders may favor which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

provisions of delaware law and provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or have the effect of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire control of us additionally our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue additional series of preferred stock and such preferred stock could be issued as a defensive measure in response to a takeover proposal these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if an acquisition might be in the best interest of our stockholders these provisions could also potentially deprive stockholders of an opportunity to sell their shares of common stock at a premium over prevailing market prices as a result of a takeover bid or merger

approximately 35 other countries we are subject to extensive regulation worldwide regulatory bodies around the world are generally charged with protecting the interests of customers including depositors in banking entities and investors in mutual funds and other vehicles our subsidiaries may advise and safeguarding the integrity of securities and other financial markets they are not however generally charged with protecting the interests of our shareholders or creditors described below are the material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to bny mellon and its subsidiaries the descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described changes in applicable law or regulation and in their application by regulatory agencies cannot be predicted but they may have a material effect on the business and results of bny mellon and its subsidiaries for additional discussion of recent and proposed regulatory initiatives that may impact our business see “recent accounting and regulatory developments” in the mda section of the annual report which is incorporated herein by reference 

the events of the past few years have led to numerous new laws in the united states and internationally for financial institutions the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” or “doddfrank” which was enacted in july 2010 significantly restructures the financial regulatory regime in the united states including through the creation of a new systemic risk oversight body the financial stability oversight council “fsoc” the fsoc will coordinate the efforts of the primary us financial regulatory agencies including the board of governors of the federal reserve system the “federal reserve board” the office of the comptroller of the currency the “occ” the sec the commodity futures trading commission the “cftc” and the fdic in establishing regulations to address financial stability concerns the doddfrank act directs the fsoc to make recommendations to the federal reserve board as to supervisory requirements and heightened prudential standards applicable to large interconnected bank holding companies and nonbank financial companies supervised by the federal reserve board under doddfrank often referred to as “systemically important financial institutions” including capital leverage liquidity and riskmanagement requirements the doddfrank act mandates that the requirements applicable to systemically important financial institutions be more stringent than those applicable to other financial companies although the criteria for treatment as a systemically important financial institution have not yet been determined it is probable that they will apply to bny mellon 

in addition to the framework for systemic risk oversight implemented through the fsoc the doddfrank act broadly affects the financial services industry by creating a resolution authority and through numerous other provisions aimed at strengthening the sound operation of the financial services sector as discussed further throughout this section many aspects of doddfrank are subject to further rulemaking and will take effect over several years making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on bny mellon or across the industry in addition to the discussion in this section see “risk factors – recent legislative actions may have an adverse effect on the company’s operations” in part i item 1a of this form 10k 

regulated entities of bny mellon

our ability to maintain fhc status is dependent upon a number of factors including our us depository institution subsidiaries continuing to qualify as “well capitalized” as described under “prompt corrective action” below beginning in july 2011 our fhc status will also depend upon bny mellon 

 

  

bny mellon 5 

maintaining its status as “well capitalized” and “well managed” under applicable federal reserve board regulations an fhc that does not continue to meet all the requirements for fhc status will depending on which requirements it fails to meet lose the ability to undertake new activities or make acquisitions that are not generally permissible for bank holding companies without fhc status or to continue such activities currently we meet these requirements

dividend restrictions 

dividend payments by bny mellon to its shareholders are subject to the oversight of the federal reserve board on nov 17 2010 the federal reserve board issued revised temporary addendum to sr letter 094 the letter described the process the federal reserve board will follow to assess comprehensive capital plans of the 19 supervisory capital assessment program bank holding companies including any request to take capital

actions such as increased dividends or stock buybacks the federal reserve board indicated that the capital plans will be assessed against among other things the bank holding company’s ability to achieve the basel iii capital ratio requirements referred to below as they are phased in by us regulators and any potential impact of the doddfrank act on the company’s risk profile business strategy corporate structure or capital adequacy our comprehensive capital plans which were prepared using basel i capital guidelines included bank developed baseline and stress projections as well as a supervisory stress projection using adverse macroeconomic assumptions provided by the federal reserve board any increase in bny mellon’s ongoing quarterly dividends would require consultation with the federal reserve board the federal reserve board’s current guidance provides that for large bank holding companies like us dividend payout ratios exceeding 30 of aftertax net income will receive particularly close scrutiny 

bny mellon is a legal entity separate and distinct from its bank subsidiaries and other subsidiaries dividends and interest from our subsidiaries are our principal sources of funds to make capital contributions or loans to our bank subsidiaries and other subsidiaries to pay service on our own debt to honor our guarantees of debt issued by our subsidiaries or of trust preferred securities issued by a trust or to pay dividends on our own equity securities various federal and state statutes and regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid to us by our bank subsidiaries without regulatory 

consent if in the opinion of the applicable federal regulatory agency a depository institution under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice which depending on the financial condition of the bank could include the payment of dividends the regulator may require after notice and hearing that the bank cease and desist from such practice the occ the federal reserve board and the fdic have indicated that the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice if the payment would reduce a depository institution’s capital to an inadequate level moreover under the federal deposit insurance act as amended the “fdi act” an insured depository institution may not pay any dividends if the institution is under capitalized or if the payment of the dividend would cause the institution to become undercapitalized in addition the federal bank regulatory agencies have issued policy statements which 

provide that fdicinsured depository institutions and their holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of their current operating earnings 

in general the amount of dividends that may be paid by the bank of new york mellon or bny mellon na is limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under a “recent earnings” test and an “undivided profits” test under the recent earnings test a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared and paid by the entity in any calendar year exceeds the current year’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years unless the entity obtains prior regulatory approval under the undivided profits test a dividend may not be paid in excess of the entity’s “undivided profits” generally accumulated net profits that have not been paid out as dividends or transferred to surplus as a result of charges related to the restructuring of bny mellon’s securities portfolio in 2009 the bank of new york mellon and bny mellon na will require regulatory consent prior to paying a dividend the ability of bny mellon’s bank subsidiaries to pay dividends to bny mellon may also be affected by various minimum capital requirements for banking organizations 

for a further discussion of restrictions on dividends see the “liquidity and dividends” section in the mda – results of operations section in the annual report and the first five paragraphs of note 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report which are incorporated herein by reference further bny mellon’s right to participate in the assets or earnings of a subsidiary is subject to the prior claims of creditors of the subsidiary 

transactions with affiliates and insiders 

transactions between bny mellon’s bank subsidiaries and bny mellon and its nonbank subsidiaries are regulated by the federal reserve board these regulations limit the types and amounts of transactions including loans due and extensions of credit from the us bank subsidiaries that may take place and generally require those transactions to be on an arm’slength basis these regulations generally do not apply to transactions between a us bank subsidiary and its subsidiaries in general these restrictions require that any extensions of credit must be secured by designated amounts of specified

collateral and are limited as to any one of bny mellon or such nonbank affiliates to 10 of the lending bank’s capital stock and surplus and as to bny mellon and all such nonbank affiliates in the aggregate to 20 of such lending bank’s capital stock and surplus these restrictions other than the 10 of capital limit on covered transactions with any one affiliate are also applied to transactions between banks and their financial subsidiaries the doddfrank act significantly expands the coverage and scope of the limitations on affiliate transactions within a banking organization for example commencing in july 2012 the doddfrank act will require that the 10 of capital limit on covered transactions begin to apply to financial subsidiaries commencing in july 2012 doddfrank has also expanded the definition of a “covered transaction” to include derivatives transactions under which a bank or a subsidiary has credit exposure with the term “credit exposure” to be defined by the federal reserve board under its existing rulemaking authority as well as repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements 

deposit insurance 

our us banking subsidiaries including the bank of new york mellon and bny mellon na accept deposits and those deposits have the benefit of fdic insurance up to the applicable limits the fdic’s deposit insurance fund the “dif” is funded by assessments on insured depository institutions which depend on the risk category of an institution and the amount of insured deposits that it holds the fdic required all insured depository institutions to prepay estimated assessments for all of 2010 2011 and 2012 on december 30 2009 the fdic may increase or decrease the assessment rate schedule on a semiannual basis under the fdi act insurance of deposits may be terminated by the fdic upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law regulation rule order or condition imposed by a bank’s federal regulatory agency 

on feb 7 2011 the fdic adopted regulations required under the doddfrank act which set forth a new method of calculating assessments paid by large insured depository institutions including bny mellon the new regulations base insurance assessments on the average consolidated assets less the average tangible equity of the insured depository institution during the assessment period with adjustments for custody banks including bny mellon we expect the fdic assessment rule to have a minimal impact in 2011 for additional discussion about fdic assessments see “recent accounting and regulatory developments” in the mda section of the annual report which is incorporated herein by reference

federal reserve board policy historically has required bank holding companies to act as a source of strength to their bank subsidiaries and to commit capital and financial resources to support those subsidiaries the doddfrank act codifies this policy as a statutory requirement such support may be required by the federal reserve board at times when we might otherwise determine not to provide it in addition any loans by bny mellon to its bank subsidiaries would be subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of its banks in the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulator to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment in addition in certain circumstances bny mellon’s insured depository institutions could be assessed for losses incurred by another bny mellon insured depository institution in the event of impairment of capital stock of one of bny mellon’s national banks or the bank of new york mellon the bank’s stockholders could be required to pay such deficiency 

capital requirements 

as a bank holding company we are subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal reserve board our bank subsidiaries are subject to similar capital requirements administered by the federal reserve board in the case of the bank of new york mellon and by the occ in the case of our national bank subsidiaries bny mellon na and the bank of new york mellon trust company national association these requirements are intended to ensure that banking organizations have adequate capital given the risk levels of their assets and offbalance sheet financial instruments 

the riskbased capital guidelines currently applicable to bank holding companies are based on the 1988 capital accord “basel i” of the basel committee on banking supervision the “basel committee” the federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted new riskbased capital guidelines for “core banks” including bny mellon based upon the revised framework for the international convergence of capital measurement and capital standards “basel ii” issued by the basel committee in june 2004 and updated in november 2005 in december 2010 the basel committee released its final framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity 

 

  

8 bny mellon 

regulation now officially identified by the basel committee as “basel iii” basel iii when implemented by the us banking agencies and fully phasedin will require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital with a greater emphasis on common equity additional information on the calculation of our tier 1 capital total capital and riskweighted assets is set forth in “capital” in the mda – results of operations section in the annual report and additional information on our capital requirements is set forth in “recent accounting and regulatory developments” in the mda section in the annual report which are incorporated herein by reference 

basel i 

under the existing basel ibased regulations the riskbased capital ratio is determined by dividing the components of capital described further below by riskadjusted assets including certain offbalance sheet items such as standby letters of credit the regulatory capital rules state that voting common stockholders’ equity should be the predominant element within tier 1 capital and that banking organizations should avoid overreliance on noncommon equity elements riskadjusted assets are determined by classifying assets and certain offbalance sheet items into weighted categories the required minimum ratio of “total capital” the sum of “tier 1” and “tier 2” capital to riskadjusted assets is currently 8 the required minimum ratio of tier 1 capital to riskadjusted assets is 4 the riskbased capital rules state that the capital requirements are minimum standards based primarily on broad creditrisk considerations and do not take into account the other types of risk a banking organization may be exposed to  eg  interest rate market liquidity and operational risks the federal reserve board may therefore set higher capital requirements for categories of banks  eg systematically important financial institutions or for an individual bank as situations warrant for example holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets other factors identified by the riskbased capital requirements as important in assessing an institution’s overall capital adequacy include concentration of credit risk and certain risks arising from nontraditional activities including the management of those risks at dec 31 2010 bny mellon’s tier 1 capital to riskadjusted assets and total capital ratios were 134 and 163 respectively 

in addition the riskbased capital guidelines incorporate a measure for market risk in foreign exchange and commodity activities and in the trading of debt and equity instruments the market riskbased capital guidelines require banking organizations with large trading activities to maintain capital for market risk in an amount calculated by using the banking organizations’ own internal valueatrisk models subject to parameters set by the regulators in january 2011 the federal banking agencies published proposed amendments to their market risk rules known as “basel ii5” those changes will result in increased capital requirements for market risk 

basel ii 

the federal bank regulatory agencies are mandating the adoption of basel ii for “core” banks bny mellon and its depository institution subsidiaries are “core” banks the only approach available to “core” banks is the advanced internal ratings based “airb” approach for credit risk and the advanced measurement approach “ama” for operational risk 

the us basel ii final rule became effective on april 1 2008 under the final rule in its current form 2009 was the first year for a bank to begin its first of three transitional floor periods during which banks subject to the final rule calculate their capital requirements under both the old regulations and new regulations the us basel ii rules currently provide that “core” banks would calculate their capital requirements only under the new basel iibased requirements after completion of the three transitional floor periods in the us we began the parallel run of calculations under both the old and new guidelines in the second quarter of 2010 doddfrank requires the us banking agencies to amend their capital rules to provide that minimum capital as required under the basel ibased rules will act as a floor for minimum capital requirements calculated in accordance with the us basel ii rules accordingly the transition for “core” banks to calculations only under the basel iibased requirements is being eliminated beginning jan 1 2008 we implemented the basel ii standardized approach for our banks organized in the united kingdom belgium and luxembourg we maintain an active dialogue with us and international regulatory jurisdictions to facilitate a smooth basel ii reporting process we believe basel ii will not constrain our current business practices 

basel iii 

the basel iii final capital framework among other things 

 

  

bny mellon 9 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress banking institutions with a ratio of cet1 to riskweighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer or below the combined capital 

conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer when the latter is applied will face constraints on dividends equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall 

the implementation of the basel iii final framework will commence jan 1 2013 on that date banking institutions will be required to meet the following minimum capital ratios 

 

  

  

 the basel iii final framework provides for a number of new deductions from and adjustments to cet1 these include for example the requirement that mortgage servicing rights deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in nonconsolidated financial entities be deducted from cet1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10 of cet1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15 of cet1 

implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to cet1 will begin on jan 1 2014 and will be phasedin over a fiveyear period 20 per year the implementation of the capital conservation buffer will begin on jan 1 2016 at 0625 and be phased in over a fouryear period increasing by that amount on each subsequent jan 1 until it reaches 25 on jan 1 2019 

the us banking agencies have indicated informally that they expect to propose regulations implementing basel iii in mid2011 with final adoption of implementing regulations in mid2012 notwithstanding its release of the basel iii framework as a final framework the basel committee is considering further amendments to basel iii including the imposition of additional capital surcharges on globally systemically important financial institutions which could include bny mellon in addition to basel iii doddfrank requires the federal banking agencies to adopt regulations affecting banking institutions’ capital requirements in a number of respects including potentially more stringent capital requirements for systemically important financial institutions accordingly the regulations ultimately applicable to us may be substantially different from the basel iii final framework as published in december 2010

impact on bny mellon 

given that the basel iii rules are subject to change and the scope and content of capital regulations that the us banking agencies may adopt under doddfrank is uncertain we cannot be certain of the impact new capital regulations will have on our capital ratios however given our balance sheet strength and ongoing internal capital generation we currently estimate that our tier 1 common ratio under basel iii guidelines will be above 7 by dec 31 2011 this estimated ratio includes an anticipated dividend increase and potential share repurchases in 2011 assuming federal reserve board approval 

leverage requirement 

basel i and basel ii do not include a leverage requirement as an international standard however even though a leverage requirement has not been an international standard in the past the us banking agencies’ capital regulations do require bank holding companies and banks to comply with a minimum leverage ratio requirement basel iii will impose a leverage requirement as an international standard the federal reserve board’s existing leverage ratio for bank holding companies is that the bank holding company maintain a ratio of tier 1 capital to its total consolidated quarterly average assets as defined for regulatory purposes net of the loan loss reserve goodwill and certain other intangible assets the rules require a minimum leverage ratio of 3 for bank holding companies that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the federal reserve board’s riskadjusted measure for market risk all other bank holding companies are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 4 the federal reserve board has not advised us of any specific minimum leverage ratio applicable to us at dec 31 2010 our leverage ratio was 58 also the rules indicate that the federal reserve board will consider a “tangible tier 1 leverage ratio” in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities the tangible tier 1 leverage ratio is the ratio of a banking organization’s tier 1 capital excluding intangibles to total assets excluding intangibles 

liquidity ratios under basel iii 

historically regulation and monitoring of bank and bank holding company liquidity has been addressed as a supervisory matter both in the us and internationally without required formulaic measures the basel iii final framework requires banks and bank holding companies to measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests that although similar in some respects to liquidity measures historically applied by banks and 

regulators for management and supervisory purposes going forward will be required by regulation one test referred to as the liquidity coverage ratio is designed to ensure that the banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered highquality liquid assets equal to the entity’s expected net cash outflow for a 30day time horizon or if greater 25 of its expected total cash outflow under an acute liquidity stress scenario the other referred to as the net stable funding ratio is designed to promote more medium and longterm funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a oneyear time horizon these requirements will incentivize banking entities to increase their holdings of us treasury securities and other sovereign debt as a component of assets and increase the use of longterm debt as a funding source the liquidity coverage ratio would be implemented subject to an observation period beginning in 2011 but would not be introduced as a requirement until jan 1 2015 and the net stable funding ratio would not be introduced as a requirement until jan 1 2018 these new standards are subject to further rulemaking and their terms may well change before implementation 

prompt corrective action 

the fdi act as amended by the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 “fdicia” requires the federal banking agencies to take “prompt corrective action” in respect of depository institutions that do not meet specified capital requirements fdicia establishes five capital categories for fdicinsured banks wellcapitalized adequatelycapitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized a depository institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if the banking institution has a total riskbased capital ratio of 100 or greater a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of 60 or greater and a leverage ratio of 50 or greater and the institution is not subject to an order written agreement capital directive or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific level for any capital measure the fdi act imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations management and capital distributions depending on the capital category in which an institution is classified 

at dec 31 2010 all of our bank subsidiaries were “well capitalized” based on the ratios and guidelines noted above a bank’s capital category however is determined solely for the purpose of applying the prompt corrective action rules and may not be an accurate representation of the bank’s overall financial condition or prospects

depositor preference 

under federal law depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses and employee compensation against an insured depository institution are afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution including federal funds and letters of credit in the “liquidation or other resolution” of such an institution by any receiver 

antimoney laundering and the usa patriot act 

a major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions in recent years has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing the usa patriot act of 2001 the “usa patriot act” substantially broadened the scope of us antimoney laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the us the us treasury department has proposed and in some cases issued a number of implementing regulations which apply various requirements of the usa patriot act to financial institutions such as bny mellon’s bank brokerdealer and investment adviser subsidiaries and mutual funds and private investment companies advised or sponsored by our subsidiaries those regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies procedures and controls to detect prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers certain of those regulations impose specific due diligence requirements on financial institutions that maintain correspondent or private banking relationships with nonus financial institutions or persons failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution 

privacy 

the privacy provisions of the grammleachbliley act generally prohibit financial institutions including bny mellon from disclosing nonpublic personal financial information of consumer customers to third parties for certain purposes primarily marketing unless customers have the opportunity to “opt out” of the disclosure the fair credit reporting act restricts information sharing among affiliates for marketing purposes 

acquisitions 

federal and state laws impose notice and approval requirements for mergers and acquisitions involving depository institutions or bank holding companies the bhc act requires the prior approval of the federal reserve board for the direct or indirect acquisition of more than 50 of any class of the voting shares or all or substantially all of the assets of a commercial bank savings and loan association or bank holding company in reviewing bank acquisition and merger applications the bank regulatory authorities will consider among other things the competitive effect of the transaction financial and managerial issues including the capital position of the combined organization convenience and needs factors including the applicant’s record under the community reinvestment act of 1977 which requires us banks to help serve the credit needs of their communities including credit to low and moderate income individuals and geographies and the effectiveness of the subject organizations in combating money laundering activities in addition other acquisitions by bny mellon may be subject to informal notice and approval by the federal reserve board or other regulatory authorities 

competition 

bny mellon is subject to intense competition in all aspects and areas of our business our asset management and wealth management businesses experience competition from asset management firms hedge funds investment banking companies and other financial services companies including trust banks brokerage firms and insurance companies these firms and companies may be domiciled domestically or internationally our asset servicing issuer services clearing services and treasury services businesses compete with domestic and foreign banks that offer institutional trust custody products and cash management products as well as a wide range of technologically capable service providers such as data processing and shareholder service firms and other firms that rely on automated data transfer services for institutional and retail customers 

many of our competitors with the particular exception of bank and financial holding companies banks and trust companies are not subject to regulation as extensive as that described under the “supervision and regulation” section of this form 10k and as a result may have a competitive advantage over us and our subsidiaries in certain respects 

 

  

12 bny mellon 

in recent years there has been substantial consolidation among companies in the financial services industry many broadbased financial services firms now have the ability to offer a wide range of products from loans deposittaking and insurance to brokerage and asset management which may enhance their competitive position as a result of current conditions in the global financial markets and the economy in general competition could continue to intensify and consolidation of financial service companies could continue to increase 

as part of our business strategy we seek to distinguish ourselves from competitors by the level of service we deliver to our clients we also believe that technological innovation is an important competitive factor and for this reason have made and continue to make substantial investments in this area the ability to recover quickly from unexpected events is a competitive factor and we have devoted significant resources to being able to implement this for additional discussion regarding competition see part i item 1a of this form 10k “risk factors – competition – we are subject to intense competition in all aspects of our business which could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability” below which is incorporated herein by reference

 item 1a risk factors 

making or continuing an investment in securities issued by us including our common stock involves certain risks that you should carefully consider the following discussion sets forth some of the more important risk factors that could affect our business financial condition or results of operations however other factors besides those discussed below or elsewhere in this form 10k or other of our reports filed with or furnished to the sec also could adversely affect our business or results we cannot assure you that the risk factors described below or elsewhere in this document address all potential risks that we may face these risk factors also serve to describe factors which may cause our results to differ materially from those described in forwardlooking statements included herein or in other documents or statements that make reference to this form 10k see “forwardlooking statements” 

uncertainties in global financial markets and the economy generally may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the domestic and global financial markets and the economy generally both in the us and elsewhere around the world while there are indications that both the financial markets and the economy are recovering from the recent worldwide recession a variety of factors raise concern over the course and strength of the recovery including low interest rates depressed home prices and increasing foreclosures volatile equity market values high unemployment governmental budget deficits including in the us at the federal state and municipal level contagion risk from possible default by other countries on sovereign debt declining business and consumer confidence and the risk of increased inflation these factors continue to have a significant effect on both the global economy and our business the resulting economic pressure on consumers and lack of confidence in the financial markets may adversely affect certain portions of our business and our financial condition and results of 

operations a worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on us and others in the financial institutions industry in particular we may face the following risks in connection with these events

 concerns over market volatility continue 

the capital and credit markets experienced unprecedented volatility and disruption during the financial crisis while markets stabilized in 2010 further upheaval could produce downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers’ underlying financial strength under these extreme conditions hedging and other risk management strategies may not be as effective at mitigating trading losses as they would be under less volatile market conditions moreover under these conditions market participants are particularly exposed to trading strategies employed by many market participants simultaneously and on a large scale such as crowded trades severe market events have historically been difficult to predict however and we could realize significant losses if unprecedented extreme market events were to continue such as the recent conditions in the global financial markets and global economy for a discussion of risk see “risk management” in the mda – results of operations section in the annual report 

if markets experience further upheavals there can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse effect which may be material on our ability to access capital and on our business financial condition and results of operations 

reputational legal and regulatory risk—our business may be negatively affected by adverse publicity regulatory actions or litigation with respect to us other wellknown companies and the financial services industry generally 

we are subject to reputational legal and regulatory risk in the ordinary course of our business these risks could include adverse publicity and damage to our reputation arising from events in the financial markets our failure or perceived failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements the purported actions of our employees alleged financial reporting irregularities involving ourselves or other large and wellknown companies increasing regulatory scrutiny of “know your customer” antimoney laundering and antiterrorist procedures and their 

effectiveness and litigation that may arise from our failure or perceived failure to comply with policies and procedures any or all of these risks could result in increased regulatory supervision affect our ability to attract and retain customers or maintain access to the capital markets result in lawsuits enforcement actions damages fines and penalties or have other adverse effects on us customers of our subsidiaries may make claims pertaining to the performance of fiduciary responsibilities which may result in material financial liability and materially impair our reputation if not resolved in a manner favorable to the subsidiary investigations by various federal and state regulatory agencies the department of justice and state attorneys general and any related litigation could have an adverse effect on us see ”legal proceedings” in note 25 of the consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision including regulation and supervision in nonus jurisdictions 

we operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to a comprehensive statutory regulatory regime as well as oversight by governmental agencies in light of the current conditions in the global financial markets and economy the obama administration congress and regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry new or modified regulations and related regulatory guidance including under basel iii and the doddfrank act may have unforeseen or unintended adverse effects on the financial services industry the regulatory perspective particularly that of the federal reserve board on regulatory capital requirements may affect our ability to make acquisitions declare dividends or repurchase our common stock unless we can demonstrate to the satisfaction of our regulators that such actions would not adversely affect our regulatory capital position in the event of a severely stressed market environment in addition the implementation of certain of the regulations with regard to regulatory capital could disproportionately affect our regulatory capital position relative to that of our competitors failure to comply with laws regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies civil money penalties and reputational damage which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations although we have policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur laws regulations or policies including accounting standards and

interpretations currently affecting us and our subsidiaries may change at any time regulatory authorities may also change their interpretation of these statutes and regulations therefore our business may be adversely affected by future changes in laws regulations policies or interpretations or regulatory approaches to compliance and enforcement see “supervision and regulation” in this form 10k some of the governmental authorities which may assert jurisdictional regulatory authority over us are located in and operate under jurisdictions outside the united states such jurisdictions may utilize legal principles and systems that differ materially from those encountered in the united states among other things litigation in foreign jurisdictions may be decided much more quickly than in the us trials may not involve testimony of witnesses who are in the courtroom and subject to crossexamination and trials may be based solely on submission of written materials these factors can make issues of regulatory compliance and legal proceedings more difficult to assess 

we may experience further writedowns of our financial instruments and other losses related to volatile and illiquid market conditions  impairment of our instruments could harm our earnings 

we maintain an investment securities portfolio of various holdings types and maturities these securities are generally classified as availableforsale and consequently are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax our portfolio includes nonagency us and nonus residential mortgagebacked securities commercial mortgagebacked securities and credit cards the values of which are subject to market price volatility to the extent unhedged if such investments suffer credit losses as we experienced with some of our investments in 2009 we may recognize in earnings the credit losses as an otherthantemporary impairment for information regarding the sensitivity of and risks associated with the market value of portfolio investments and interest rates refer to the “risk management—market risk” section in the mda – results of operations section in the annual report 

recent legislative actions may have an adverse effect on the company’s operations 

in july 2010 president obama signed into law the doddfrank act this new law broadly affects the financial services industry particularly those entities 

considered to be “systemically important” such as bank holding companies with assets of over 50 billion including bny mellon by establishing a framework for systemic risk oversight creating a liquidation authority mandating higher capital and liquidity requirements requiring banks to pay increased fees to regulatory agencies and numerous other provisions aimed at strengthening the sound operation of the financial services sector 

us regulatory agencies – banking securities and commodities – have begun to publish notices of proposed regulations required by doddfrank during the past several months and new bodies created by doddfrank including the fsoc and the bureau of consumer financial protection are commencing operations the related findings of various regulatory and commission studies the interpretations issued as part of the rulemaking process and the final regulations that are issued with respect to various elements of the new law may cause changes that impact the profitability of our business activities and require that we change certain of our business practices and plans including those relating to crossselling our products and services these changes could also expose us to additional costs including increased legal and compliance costs and require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes 

interest rate environment—our revenues and profits are sensitive to changes in interest rates 

our net interest revenue and cash flows are sensitive to interest rate changes and changes in valuations in the debt or equity markets over which we have no control our net interest revenue is the difference between the interest income earned on our interestearning assets such as the loans we make and the securities we hold in our investment portfolio and the interest expense incurred on our interestbearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed money we also earn net interest revenue on interestfree funds we hold 

the global market crisis has triggered a series of cuts in interest rates during fiscal 2010 the federal open market committee kept the target federal funds rate between 0 and 025 the low interest rate environment has compressed our net interest spread and reduced our spreadbased revenues it has also resulted in our voluntarily waiving fees on certain money market mutual funds and related distribution fees in order to prevent our clients’ yields on such funds from becoming negative changes in interest

rates could affect the interest earned on assets differently than interest paid on liabilities a rising interest rate environment generally results in our earning a larger net interest spread conversely a falling interest rate environment generally results in our earning a smaller net interest spread if we are unable to effectively manage our interest rate risk changes in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our profitability further volatility in interest rates could trigger one or more of the following additional effects 

 

  

  

  

  

 a more detailed discussion of the interest rate and market risks we face is contained in the “risk management” section in the mda – results of operations in the annual report 

deposit insurance premiums may continue to increase 

during 2009 and 2010 due to a higher level of bank failures the fdic increased recurring deposit insurance premiums imposed a special assessment on insured financial institutions and required insured financial institutions to prepay three years of deposit premiums due to the continuing volume of bank failures it is possible that a continued high level of funding will be required from insured financial institutions such as bny mellon 

competition—we are subject to intense competition in all aspects of our business which could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability 

many businesses in which we operate are intensely competitive around the world other domestic and international banks and financial service companies such as trading firms broker dealers investment banks specialized processing companies outsourcing companies data processing companies and asset managers aggressively compete with us for feebased business we also face competition from both unregulated and regulated financial services organizations such as mutual funds insurance companies credit unions money market funds and investment counseling firms whose products and services span the local national and global markets in which we conduct operations in addition insurance companies investment counseling firms brokerage houses and other business firms and individuals offer active competition for personal trust services and investment counseling services 

furthermore pricing pressures as a result of the ability of competitors to offer comparable or improved products or services at a lower price and customer pricing reviews may result in a reduction in the price we can charge for our products and services which would likely negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability 

recently enacted and proposed legislation and regulation may impact our ability to conduct certain of our businesses in a costeffective manner or at all including legislation relating to restrictions on the type of activities in which financial institutions are permitted to engage these or other similar proposals which may not apply to all of our competitors could adversely impact our ability to compete effectively a decline in our competitive position could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability 

dependence on feebased business—we are dependent on feebased business for a substantial majority of our revenue and our feebased revenues could be adversely affected by a slowing in capital market activity significant declines in market values or negative trends in savings rates or in individual investment preferences 

our principal operational focus is on feebased business as distinct from commercial banking 

 

  

bny mellon 19 

institutions that earn most of their revenues from loans and other traditional interestgenerating products and services we have redeployed our assets away from traditional retail banking to concentrate our resources further on feebased businesses including cash management custody mutual fund services unit investment trusts corporate trust depositary receipts stock transfer securities execution and clearance collateral management and asset management 

fees for many of our products and services are based on the volume of transactions processed the market value of assets managed and administered securities lending volume and spreads and fees for other services rendered corporate actions crossborder investing global mergers and acquisitions activity new debt and equity issuances and secondary trading volumes all affect the level of our revenues 

assetbased fees are typically determined on a sliding scale so that as the value of a client portfolio grows we receive a smaller percentage of the increasing value as fee income this is particularly important to our asset management global funds services and global custody businesses significant declines in the values of capital assets would reduce the market value of some of the assets that we manage and administer and result in a corresponding decrease in the amount of fees we receive and therefore would have an adverse effect on our results of operations similarly significant declines in the volume of capital markets activity would reduce the number of transactions we process and the amount of securities lending we do and therefore would also have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

our business generally benefits when individuals invest their savings in mutual funds and other collective funds in defined benefit plans unit investment trusts or exchange traded funds if there is a decline in the savings rates of individuals or if there is a change in investment preferences that leads to less investment in mutual funds other collective funds and defined contribution plans our revenues could be adversely affected 

our feebased revenues could be adversely affected by a stable exchangerate environment or decreased crossborder investing activity 

the degree of volatility in foreign exchange rates can affect the amount of our foreign exchange trading revenue most of our foreign exchange revenue is derived from our securities servicing client base activity levels and spreads are generally higher when 

there is more volatility accordingly we benefit from currency volatility and our foreign exchange revenue is likely to decrease during times of decreased currency volatility 

our future revenue may increase or decrease depending upon the extent of increases or decreases in crossborder or other investments made by our clients economic and political uncertainties resulting from terrorist attacks military actions or other events including changes in laws or regulations governing crossborder transactions such as currency controls could result in decreased crossborder investment activity decreased crossborder investing could lead to decreased demand for investor services that we provide 

the trend towards use of electronic trade networks instead of traditional modes of exchange may result in unfavorable pressure on our foreign exchange business which could adversely impact our foreign exchange revenue 

our ability to retain existing business and obtain new business is dependent on our consistent execution of the feebased services we perform 

we provide custody accounting daily pricing and administration master trust and master custody investment management trustee and recordkeeping foreign exchange securities lending securities execution and clearance correspondent clearing stock transfer cash management trading and information services to clients worldwide assets under custody and assets under management are held by us in a custodial or fiduciary capacity and are not included in our assets if we fail to perform these services in a manner consistent with our fiduciary custodial and other obligations existing and potential clients may lose confidence in our ability to properly perform these services and our business may be adversely affected in addition any such failure may result in contingent liabilities that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or losses that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

our internal strategies and forecasts assume a growing client base and increasing client usage of our services a decline in the pace at which we attract new clients and a decline of the pace at which existing and new clients use additional services and assign additional assets to us for management or custody would adversely affect our future results of operations a decline in the rate at which our clients 

 

  

20 bny mellon 

outsource functions such as their internal accounts payable activities would also adversely affect our results of operations 

strategic acquisitions may pose integration risks 

from time to time to achieve our strategic objectives we have acquired or invested in other companies or businesses and may do so in the future each of these poses integration challenges including successfully retaining clients and key employees of both businesses and capitalizing on certain revenue synergies we cannot assure you that we will realize when anticipated or at all the positive benefits expected as a result of our acquisitions or that any businesses acquired will be successfully integrated 

the soundness of financial institutions and other counterparties could adversely affect us 

our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients as a result defaults by or even rumors or questions about one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally have in the past led to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions in the future many transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparties or clients in addition our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us there is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

any material reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets 

our longterm debt is currently rated investment grade by the major rating agencies these rating agencies regularly evaluate us and their ratings of our longterm debt are based on a number of factors including our financial strength as well as factors not 

entirely within our control including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally 

in addition rating agencies employ different models and formulas to assess the financial strength of a rated company and from time to time rating agencies have in their discretion altered these models changes to the models general economic conditions or other circumstances outside our control could impact a rating agency’s judgment of its rating and the rating it assigns us in view of the difficulties experienced recently by many financial institutions we believe that the rating agencies may heighten the level of scrutiny that they apply to such institutions may increase the frequency and scope of their credit reviews may request additional information from the companies that they rate and may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels 

the outcome of such a review may have adverse ratings consequences which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding and increase our cost of capital we cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take or what actions we may be required to take in response to the actions of rating agencies which may adversely affect us 

capital adequacy—we are subject to capital adequacy guidelines and if we fail to meet these guidelines our financial condition would be adversely affected 

under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines and other regulatory requirements bny mellon and our subsidiary banks and brokerdealers must meet guidelines that include quantitative measures of assets liabilities and certain offbalance sheet items subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components risk weightings and other factors as discussed under “supervision and regulation – capital requirements” in this form 10k the capital requirements applicable to us as a bank holding company as well as to our subsidiary banks are in the process of being substantially revised in connection with basel iii and the requirements of the doddfrank act if our company our subsidiary banks or brokerdealers failed to meet these minimum capital guidelines and other regulatory requirements their respective financial conditions would be materially and adversely affected in light of recent market events doddfrank and basel iii bny mellon and 

 

  

bny mellon 21 

our subsidiary banks will be required to satisfy additional more stringent capital adequacy standards we cannot fully predict the final form of or the effects of these regulations failure by bny mellon or one of our us bank subsidiaries to maintain its status as “wellcapitalized” and “well managed” if unremedied over a period of time would cause us to lose our status as a fhc and could affect the confidence of clients in us thus also compromising our competitive position see “supervision and regulation” in this form 10k and the “liquidity and dividends” and “capital – capital adequacy” sections in the mda – results of operations section and the “recent accounting and regulatory developments” section in the mda section in the annual report 

access to capital markets—if our ability to access the capital markets is diminished our business may be adversely affected 

our business is dependent in part on our ability to access successfully the capital markets on a regular basis we rely on access to both shortterm money markets and longterm capital markets as significant sources of liquidity to the extent liquidity requirements are not satisfied by the cash flow from our consolidated operations events or circumstances such as rising interest rates market disruptions or loss of confidence of debt purchasers or counterparties in us or in the funds markets could limit our access to capital markets increase our cost of borrowing adversely affect our liquidity or impair our ability to execute our business plan in addition our ability to raise funding could be impaired if lenders develop a negative perception of our longterm or shortterm financial prospects such negative perceptions could be developed if we incur large trading losses we are downgraded or put on or remain on negative watch by the rating agencies we suffer a decline in the level of our business activity regulatory authorities take significant action against us or we discover significant employee misconduct or illegal activity among other reasons if we are unable to raise funding using the methods described above we would likely need to finance or liquidate unencumbered assets such as our investment and trading portfolios to meet maturing liabilities we may be unable to sell some of our assets or we may have to sell assets at a discount from market value either of which could adversely affect our results of operations 

monetary and other governmental policies—our business is influenced by monetary and other governmental policies 

the monetary tax and other policies of the government and its agencies including the federal reserve board have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance due to current market conditions we anticipate that monetary tax and other government policies will become more rigorous heightened regulatory scrutiny and increased sanctions changes or potential changes in domestic and international legislation and regulation as well as domestic or international regulatory investigations impose compliance legal review and response costs that may impact our profitability and may allow additional competition facilitate consolidation of competitors or attract new competitors into our businesses the cost of geographically diversifying and maintaining our facilities to comply with regulatory mandates necessarily results in additional costs various legislative initiatives are from time to time introduced in congress or relevant state legislatures we cannot determine the ultimate effect that any such potential legislation if enacted would have upon our financial condition or operations see “supervision and regulation” in this form 10k 

operational risk—we are exposed to operational risk as a result of providing certain services which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we are exposed to operational risk as a result of providing various feebased services including certain securities servicing global payment services private banking and asset management services operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from errors related to transaction processing breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements fraud by employees or persons outside the company business interruption due to system failures or other events or other risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes people and systems or from external events including legal risk we regularly assess and monitor operational risk in our business and provide for disaster and business recovery planning including geographical diversification of our facilities however the occurrence of various events including unforeseeable and unpreventable events such as hurricanes or other natural disasters could still damage our physical facilities or our computer systems or software cause delay or disruptions to operational functions impair our clients vendors and counterparties and negatively 

 

  

22 bny mellon 

impact our results of operations operational risk also includes potential legal or regulatory actions that could arise as a result of noncompliance with applicable laws and regulatory requirements which could have an adverse effect on our reputation for a discussion of risk see “risk management” in the mda – results of operations section in the annual report 

our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented 

management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures any system of controls however well designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system are met any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition if we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are otherwise required to restate our financial statements we could be required to implement expensive and timeconsuming remedial measures and could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports 

our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 

we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business any failure interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management general ledger deposit loan and other systems while we have policies procedures and technical safeguards designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure interruption or security breach of our information systems there can be no assurance that any such failures interruptions or security breaches will not occur or if they do occur that they will be adequately addressed the occurrence of any failures interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation result in a loss of customer business subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of risk see “risk 

management” in the mda – results of operations section in the annual report 

technology—we depend on our technology and intellectual property if third parties misappropriate our intellectual property our business may be adversely affected 

we are dependent on technology because many of our products and services involve processing large volumes of data our technology platforms must therefore provide global capabilities and scale rapid technological changes require significant and ongoing investments in technology to develop competitive new products and services or adopt new technologies technological advances which result in lower transaction costs may adversely impact our revenues in addition unsuccessful implementation of technological upgrades and new products may adversely impact our ability to service and retain customers 

developments in the securities processing industry including shortened settlement cycles and straightthroughprocessing will necessitate ongoing changes to our business and operations and will likely require additional investment in technology our financial performance depends in part on our ability to develop and market new and innovative services to adopt or develop new technologies that differentiate our products or provide cost efficiencies and to deliver these products and services to the market in a timely manner at a competitive price 

rapid technological change in the financial services industry together with competitive pressures require us to make significant and ongoing investments we cannot provide any assurance that our technology spending will achieve gains in competitiveness or profitability and the costs we incur in product development could be substantial accordingly we could incur substantial development costs without achieving corresponding gains in profitability 

furthermore if a third party were to assert a claim of infringement or misappropriation of its proprietary rights obtained through patents or otherwise against us with respect to one or more of our methods of doing business or conducting our operations we could be required to spend significant amounts to defend such claims develop alternative methods of operations pay substantial money damages or obtain a license from the third party 

 

  

bny mellon 23 

global operations—we are subject to political economic legal operational and other risks that are inherent in operating globally 

in conducting our businesses and maintaining and supporting our global operations we are subject to risks of loss from the outbreak of hostilities or acts of terrorism and various unfavorable political economic legal or other developments including social or political instability changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks expropriation nationalization confiscation of assets price controls capital controls exchange controls and changes in laws and regulations further our businesses and operations are increasingly expanding into new regions throughout the world including emerging markets various emerging market countries have experienced severe economic and financial disruptions including significant devaluations of their currencies defaults or threatened defaults on sovereign debt capital and currency exchange controls and low or negative growth rates in their economies as well as military activity or acts of terrorism the possible effects of any of these conditions may adversely affect our business and increase volatility in global financial markets generally 

acts of terrorism—acts of terrorism and global conflicts may have a negative impact on our business 

acts of terrorism and global conflicts could have a significant impact on our business and operations while we have in place business continuity and disaster recovery plans acts of terrorism could still damage our facilities and disrupt or delay normal operations and have a similar impact on our clients suppliers and counterparties acts of terrorism and global conflicts could also negatively impact the purchase of our products and services to the extent they resulted in reduced capital markets activity lower asset price levels or disruptions in general economic activity in the united states or abroad or in financial market settlement functions the wars in iraq and afghanistan terror attacks political unrest global conflicts the national and global efforts to combat terrorism and other potential military activities and outbreaks of hostilities have affected and may further adversely affect economic growth and may have other adverse effects on us in ways that we are unable to predict 

new lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks 

from time to time we may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business there are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed in developing and marketing new lines of business andor new products and services we may invest significant time and resources initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business andor new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible 

we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract new employees retain and motivate our existing employees and continue to compensate employees competitively amid intense public and regulatory scrutiny on the compensation practices of large financial institutions competition for the best people in most activities engaged in by us can be intense and we may not be able to hire people or to retain them our ability to attract and retain key executives andor other key employees may be hindered as a result of executive compensation limits and requirements set forth in regulations that may be issued under recently proposed and enacted legislation 

tax laws and regulations—tax law changes or challenges to our tax positions with respect to historical transactions may adversely affect our net income effective tax rate and our overall results of operations and financial condition 

in the course of our business we receive inquiries from both us and nonus tax authorities on the amount of taxes we owe such as those matters discussed in note 25 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report if we are not successful in defending these inquiries we may be required to adjust the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions all of which can require a greater provision for taxes or otherwise negatively affect earnings probabilities and outcomes are reviewed as events unfold and adjustments to the reserves are made when necessary but the reserves may prove inadequate because we cannot necessarily accurately predict the outcome of any challenge settlement or litigation or to what extent it will 

 

  

24 bny mellon 

negatively affect us or our business in addition changes in tax legislation or the interpretation of existing tax laws worldwide could have a material impact on our net income 

accounting principles—changes in accounting standards could have a material impact on our financial statements 

from time to time the financial accounting standards board the international accounting standards board the sec and bank regulators change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of our financial statements such as the potential adoption of international financial reporting standards in some cases we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in our restating prior period financial statements see “recent accounting and regulatory developments” in the mda section in the annual report these changes are difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations and other financial data although in certain instances these changes may not have an economic impact on our business 

credit reserves—we could incur income statement charges if our reserves for credit losses including loan reserves are inadequate 

we have credit exposure to residential mortgages the financial airline and automotive industries monoline financial guaranty insurers and many other industries we cannot provide any assurance as to whether chargeoffs related to these sectors or to different credit risks may occur in the future though credit risk is inherent in lending activities our revenues and profitability are adversely affected when our borrowers default in whole or in part on their loan obligations to us we rely on our business experience to estimate future defaults which we use to create loan loss reserves against our loan portfolio in addition current market developments may increase default and delinquency rates which may impact our chargeoffs we cannot provide any assurance that these reserves based on management estimates will not be required to be augmented due to an unexpectedly high level of defaults if reserves for credit losses are not sufficient we would be required to record a larger credit loss reserve against current earnings 

holding company—we are a holding company and as a result are dependent on dividends from our subsidiaries including our subsidiary banks to meet our obligations including our obligations with respect to our debt securities and to provide funds for payment of dividends to our shareholders 

we are a nonoperating holding company whose principal assets and sources of income are our principal bank subsidiaries – the bank of new york mellon and bny mellon na – and our other subsidiaries we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our banks and other subsidiaries and therefore we rely primarily on dividends and interest from these banking and other subsidiaries to meet our obligations including our obligations with respect to our debt securities and to provide funds for payment of dividends to our shareholders to the extent declared by our board of directors there are various legal limitations on the extent to which these banking and other subsidiaries can finance or otherwise supply funds to us by dividend or otherwise and certain of our affiliates 

for example as a result of charges related to the restructuring of our securities portfolio in the third quarter of 2009 the bank of new york mellon and bny mellon na currently require regulatory consent prior to paying a dividend to us 

although we maintain cash positions for liquidity at the holding company level if these banking subsidiaries or other of our subsidiaries were unable to supply us with cash over time we could be unable to meet our obligations including our obligations with respect to our debt securities or declare or pay dividends in respect of our capital stock see “supervision and regulation – dividend restrictions” in this form 10k the “liquidity and dividends” section in the mda – results of operations section and note 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report 

because we are a holding company our rights and the rights of our creditors including the holders of our debt securities to a share of the assets of any subsidiary upon the liquidation or recapitalization of the subsidiary will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors including in the case of our banking subsidiaries their depositors except to the extent that we may ourselves be a creditor with recognized claims against the subsidiary the rights of holders of our debt securities to benefit from those distributions will also be junior to those prior claims consequently our debt securities will be effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of 

 

  

bny mellon 25 

our subsidiaries a holder of our debt securities should look only to our assets for payments in respect of those debt securities 

limits on common stock dividends 

holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock we are not required to do so any increase in bny mellon’s ongoing quarterly dividend would require consultation with the federal reserve board any reduction of or the elimination of our common stock dividend in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

antitakeover provisions could negatively impact our stockholders 

provisions of delaware law and provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or have the effect of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire control of us additionally our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue additional series of preferred stock and such preferred stock could be issued as a defensive measure in response to a takeover proposal these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if an acquisition might be in the best interest of our stockholders

supervision and regulation 

bny mellon and its bank subsidiaries are subject to an extensive system of banking laws and regulations in the united states and the other countries in which we operate that are intended primarily for the protection of the customers and depositors of bny mellon’s bank subsidiaries rather than holders of bny mellon’s securities these laws and regulations govern such areas as levels of capital permissible activities reserves loans and investments and rates of interest that can be charged on loans similarly our subsidiaries engaged in investment advisory and other securities related activities are subject to various us federal and state laws and regulations that are intended to benefit clients of investment advisors and shareholders in mutual funds rather than holders of bny mellon’s securities in addition bny mellon and its subsidiaries are subject to general us federal laws and regulations and to the laws and regulations of the states or countries in which bny mellon and its subsidiaries are organized or conduct businesses described below are the material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to bny mellon and its subsidiaries the descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described changes in applicable law or regulation and in their application by regulatory agencies cannot be predicted but they may have a material effect on the business and results of bny mellon and its subsidiaries 

market disruptions have led to numerous proposals in the united states and internationally for potentially significant changes in the regulation of the financial services industry and their potential impact on us see “risk factors – recent legislative and regulatory initiatives may significantly impact our financial condition operations capital position and ability to pursue business opportunities” in part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

regulated entities of bny mellon 

bny mellon is regulated as a bank holding company and a financial holding company “fhc” under the bank holding company act of 1956 as amended by the 1999 financial modernization legislation known as the grammleachbliley act the “bhc act” as such it is subject to the supervision of the board of governors of the federal reserve system the “federal reserve board” in general the bhc act limits the business of bank holding 

companies that are fhcs to banking managing or controlling banks performing certain servicing activities for subsidiaries engaging in activities that the federal reserve board has determined by order or regulation are so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto and as a result of the grammleachbliley act amendments to the bhc act engaging in any activity or acquiring and retaining the shares of any company engaged in any activity that is either 1 financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity as determined by the federal reserve board in consultation with the secretary of the treasury or 2 complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally as solely determined by the federal reserve board activities that are financial in nature include securities underwriting and dealing insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments in commercial companies 

our ability to maintain fhc status is dependent upon a number of factors including our us depository institution subsidiaries continuing to qualify as “well capitalized” as described under “prompt corrective action” below 

an fhc that does not continue to meet all the requirements for fhc status will depending on which requirements it fails to meet lose the ability to undertake new activities or make acquisitions that are not generally permissible for bank holding companies without fhc status or to continue such activities currently we meet these requirements the bank of new york mellon which is bny mellon’s largest bank subsidiary is a new york state chartered bank is a member of the federal reserve system and is subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve board and the new york state banking department the “nysbd” bny mellon’s national bank subsidiaries bny mellon na and the bank of new york mellon trust company national association are subject to primary supervision regulation and examination by the office of the comptroller of the currency the “occ” 

we operate a number of brokerdealers that engage in securities underwriting and other brokerdealer activities these companies are sec registered brokerdealers and members of financial industry regulatory authority inc “finra” a securities industry selfregulatory organization bny mellon’s us nonbank subsidiaries engaged in securitiesrelated activities are regulated by the sec

certain of our subsidiaries are registered investment advisors under the investment advisers act of 1940 as amended and as such are supervised by the sec they are also subject to various us federal and state laws and regulations and to the laws and regulations of any countries in which they conduct business these laws and regulations generally grant supervisory agencies broad administrative powers including the power to limit or restrict the carrying on of business for failure to comply with such laws and regulations our subsidiaries advise both public investment companies which are registered with the sec under the investment company act of 1940 the “‘40 act” including the dreyfus family of mutual funds and private investment companies which are not registered under the ‘40 act the shares of most investment companies advised by our subsidiaries are qualified for sale in all states in the us and the district of columbia except for investment companies that offer products only to residents of a particular state or of a foreign country and except for certain investment companies which are exempt from such registration or qualification 

certain of bny mellon’s united kingdom incorporated subsidiaries are authorized to conduct investment business in the uk pursuant to the uk financial services and markets act 2000 “fsma 2000” their investment management advisory activities and their sale and marketing of retail investment products are regulated by the financial services authority “fsa” the fsa has broad supervisory and disciplinary powers disciplinary powers include the power to temporarily or permanently revoke the authorization to carry on regulated business following a breach of fsma 2000 andor regulatory rules the suspension of registered employees and censures and fines for both regulated businesses and their registered employees certain uk investment funds including mellon investment funds an openended investment company with variable capital advised by uk regulated subsidiaries of bny mellon are registered with the fsa and are offered for retail sale in the uk 

certain of bny mellon’s public finance activities are regulated by the municipal securities rulemaking board certain of bny mellon’s subsidiaries are registered with the commodity futures trading commission the “cftc” as commodity pool operators or commodity trading advisors and as such are subject to cftc regulation 

  

the types of activities in which the foreign branches of our banking subsidiaries and our international subsidiaries may engage are subject to various restrictions imposed by the federal reserve board those foreign branches and international subsidiaries are also subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the countries in which they operate 

dividend restrictions 

bny mellon is a legal entity separate and distinct from its bank subsidiaries and other subsidiaries dividends and interest from our subsidiaries are our principal sources of funds to make capital contributions or loans to our bank subsidiaries and other subsidiaries to pay service on our own debt to honor our guarantees of debt issued by our subsidiaries or of trust preferred securities issued by a trust or to pay dividends on our own equity securities various federal and state statutes and regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid to us by our bank subsidiaries without regulatory consent if in the opinion of the applicable federal regulatory agency a depository institution under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice which depending on the financial condition of the bank could include the payment of dividends the regulator may require after notice and hearing that the bank cease and desist from such practice the occ the federal reserve board and the fdic have indicated that the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice if the payment would deplete a depository institution’s capital to an inadequate level moreover under the federal deposit insurance act as amended the “fdi act” an insured depository institution may not pay any dividends if the institution is under capitalized or if the payment of the dividend would cause the institution to become undercapitalized in addition the federal bank regulatory agencies have issued policy statements which provide that fdicinsured depository institutions and their holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of their current operating earnings 

the federal reserve board has issued a policy statement with respect to the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies the policy statement provides that as a matter of prudent banking a bank holding company should not maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net income available to common shareholders has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the holding company’s capital needs asset quality and overall financial condition 

  

bny mellon 5 

part i continued 

 

  

the ability of bny mellon’s bank subsidiaries to pay dividends to bny mellon may also be affected by various minimum capital requirements for banking organizations for example as a result of charges related to the restructuring of bny mellon’s securities portfolio in 2009 the bank of new york mellon and bny mellon na will require regulatory consent prior to paying a dividend in addition any increase in the ongoing quarterly dividend to our common stockholders would require consultation with the federal reserve for a further discussion of restrictions on dividends see the “liquidity and dividends” section in the mda section in the annual report and the first five paragraphs of note 22 of notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report which are incorporated herein by reference further bny mellon’s right to participate in the assets or earnings of a subsidiary is subject to the prior claims of creditors of the subsidiary 

transactions with affiliates 

there are certain restrictions on the ability of bny mellon and its nonbank affiliates to borrow from and engage in other transactions with its bank subsidiaries in general these restrictions require that any extensions of credit must be secured by designated amounts of specified collateral and are limited as to any one of bny mellon or such nonbank affiliates to 10 of the lending bank’s capital stock and surplus and as to bny mellon and all such nonbank affiliates in the aggregate to 20 of such lending bank’s capital stock and surplus these restrictions other than the 10 of capital limit on covered transactions with any one affiliate are also applied to transactions between banks and their financial subsidiaries in addition certain bank transactions with affiliates must be on terms and conditions including credit standards that are substantially the same or at least as favorable to the bank as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions involving other nonaffiliated companies or in the absence of comparable transactions on terms and conditions including credit standards that in good faith would be offered to or would apply to nonaffiliated companies 

unsafe and unsound practices 

the federal banking agencies have authority to prohibit the banks they supervise from engaging in any activity which in the appropriate agency’s opinion constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting the bank’s business the federal reserve 

board has similar authority with respect to bny mellon and our nonbank subsidiaries in addition the nysbd also has similar authority with respect to the bank of new york mellon 

deposit insurance 

our us banking subsidiaries including the bank of new york mellon and bny mellon na accept deposits and those deposits have the benefit of fdic insurance up to the applicable limits the fdic’s deposit insurance fund the “dif” is funded by assessments on insured depository institutions which depend on the risk category of an institution and the amount of insured deposits that it holds the fdic may increase or decrease the assessment rate schedule on a semiannual basis 

as part of its efforts to rebuild the dif the fdic adopted a rule imposing a special assessment of five basis points on each fdicinsured depository institution’s assets minus its tier 1 capital as of june 30 2009 subject to a cap of 10 basis points of average assessable domestic deposits for the second quarter of 2009 this special assessment totaled approximately 61 million for our bank subsidiaries additionally as part of its efforts to rebuild the dif the fdic also required insured depository institutions including our bank subsidiaries to prepay their estimated assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009 and all of 2010 2011 and 2012 on dec 30 2009 the bank of new york mellon and bny mellon na our two principal banks prepaid an aggregate of 295 million for their estimated quarterly riskbased assessments for these periods 

we also participated in the fdic’s temporary liquidity guarantee program see page 12 for a discussion of deposit insurance related to that program 

source of strength 

under the bhc act and federal reserve board policy bny mellon is expected to act as a source of financial strength to its bank subsidiaries and to commit capital and financial resources to those subsidiaries such support may be required by the federal reserve board at times when we might otherwise determine not to provide it in addition any loans by bny mellon to its bank subsidiaries would be subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of its banks in the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulator to maintain the

capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment 

liability of commonly controlled institutions and related matters 

the fdi act contains a “crossguarantee” provision that could result in any insured depository institution owned by bny mellon being assessed for losses incurred by the fdic in connection with assistance provided to or the failure of any other insured depository institution owned by bny mellon 

in addition under the national bank act if the capital stock of a national bank such as bny mellon na or the bank of new york mellon trust company national association is impaired by losses or otherwise the occ is authorized to require payment of the deficiency by assessment upon the bank’s shareholders pro rata  and to the extent necessary if any such assessment is not paid by any shareholder after three months notice to sell the stock of such shareholder to make good the deficiency 

regulatory capital 

the federal bank regulatory authorities have substantially similar riskbased capital and leverage ratio guidelines for banking organizations the guidelines are intended to ensure that banking organizations have adequate capital given the risk levels of their assets and offbalance sheet financial instruments 

the riskbased capital guidelines currently applicable to bank holding companies are based on the 1988 capital accord “basel i” of the basel committee on banking supervision the “basel committee” as discussed further below the federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted new riskbased capital guidelines for “core banks” including bny mellon based upon the revised framework for the international convergence of capital measurement and capital standards “basel ii” issued by the basel committee in june 2004 and updated in november 2005 

under the existing basel ibased guidelines the riskbased capital ratio is determined by dividing the components of capital described further below by riskadjusted assets including certain offbalance sheet items such as standby letters of credit riskadjusted assets are determined by classifying assets and certain offbalance sheet items into weighted 

categories the required minimum ratio of “total capital” the sum of tier 1 and tier 2 to riskadjusted assets including certain offbalance sheet items such as standby letters of credit is currently 8 the required minimum ratio of tier 1 capital to riskadjusted assets is 4 at dec 31 2009 bny mellon’s total capital and tier 1 capital to riskadjusted assets ratios were 160 and 121 respectively additional information on the calculation of our tier 1 capital total capital and riskweighted assets is set forth in “capital” in the mda section in the annual report which portion of the annual report is incorporated herein by reference 

the riskbased capital requirements identify concentration of credit risk and certain risks arising from nontraditional activities and the management of those risks as important factors to consider in assessing an institution’s overall capital adequacy in addition the riskbased capital guidelines incorporate a measure for market risk in foreign exchange and commodity activities and in the trading of debt and equity instruments the market riskbased capital guidelines require banking organizations with large trading activities to maintain capital for market risk in an amount calculated by using the banking organizations’ own internal valueatrisk models subject to parameters set by the regulators 

the federal bank regulatory agencies are mandating the adoption of basel ii for “core” banks bny mellon and its depository institution subsidiaries are “core” banks the only approach available to “core” banks is the advanced internal ratings based “airb” approach for credit risk and the advanced measurement approach “ama” for operational risk 

the us basel ii final rule published by the us regulatory agencies became effective on april 1 2008 under the final rule 2009 was the first year for a bank to begin its first of three transitional floor periods during which banks subject to the final rule calculate their capital requirements under both the old guidelines and new guidelines 

in the us we will begin the parallel run of calculations under both the old and new guidelines in the second quarter of 2010 beginning jan 1 2008 we implemented the basel ii standardized approach for our banks organized in the united kingdom belgium and luxembourg we 

  

bny mellon 7 

part i continued 

 

  

maintain an active dialogue with us and international regulatory jurisdictions to facilitate a smooth basel ii reporting process we believe basel ii will not constrain our current business practices 

the federal reserve board requires bank holding companies to comply with minimum leverage ratio guidelines the leverage ratio is the ratio of a bank holding company’s tier 1 capital to its total consolidated quarterly average assets as defined for regulatory purposes net of the loan loss reserve goodwill and certain other intangible assets the guidelines require a minimum leverage ratio of 3 for bank holding companies that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the federal reserve board’s riskadjusted measure for market risk all other bank holding companies are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 4 the federal reserve board has not advised us of any specific minimum leverage ratio applicable to us at dec 31 2009 our leverage ratio was 65 

the federal reserve board’s capital guidelines provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets also the guidelines indicate that the federal reserve board will consider a “tangible tier 1 leverage ratio” in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities the tangible tier 1 leverage ratio is the ratio of a banking organization’s tier 1 capital excluding intangibles to total assets excluding intangibles 

basel proposed capital and liquidity requirements 

on dec 17 2009 the basel committee issued two consultative documents proposing reforms to bank capital and liquidity regulation which are intended to address lessons learned from the financial crisis that began in 2007 the document titled “ strengthening the resilience of the banking sector ” which proposes reforms to bank capital and the document titled “ international framework for liquidity risk management standards and monitoring ” are discussed below the proposal included in the document titled “ strengthening the resilience of the banking sector ” would significantly revise the definitions of tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital with the most significant changes being to tier 1 capital among other things the proposal would disqualify 

certain capital instruments – including usstyle trust preferred securities and other instruments that effectively pay cumulative distributions – from tier 1 capital status 

the liquidity proposals included in the document titled “ international framework for liquidity risk management standards and monitoring ” would impose two measures of liquidity risk exposure one based on a 30day time horizon and the other addressing longerterm structural liquidity mismatches over a oneyear time period 

the basel committee indicated that it expects final provisions responsive to the proposals to be implemented by dec 31 2012 ultimate implementation in individual countries including the united states is subject to the discretion of the bank regulators in those countries the basel committee’s final proposals may differ from the proposals released in december 2009 and the regulations and guidelines adopted by regulatory authorities having jurisdiction over bny mellon and its subsidiaries may differ from the final accord of the basel committee moreover although some aspects of the basel committee proposals were quite specific for example the definition of the components of capital others were merely conceptual for example the description of the leverage test and others not specifically addressed for example the minimum percentages for required capital ratios we are not able to predict at this time the content of guidelines or regulations that will ultimately be adopted by regulatory agencies having authority over bny mellon and its subsidiaries or the impact of changes in capital and liquidity regulation upon us however if current requirements are revised to mandate that bny mellon and its bank subsidiaries maintain more capital with common equity as a more predominant component or manage the configuration of their assets and liabilities in order to comply with formulaic liquidity requirements it could significantly impact our financial condition operations capital position and ability to pursue business opportunities 

us treasury proposed capital requirements 

in september 2009 the us department of the treasury issued a policy statement “principles for reforming the us and international regulatory capital framework for banking firms” this statement sets forth core principles that the treasury believes would shape a new international capital accord to better protect the safety and soundness of

part i continued 

 

  

individual banking firms and the stability of the global financial system and economy these core principles include a capital requirements should be designed to protect the stability of the financial system not just the solvency of individual banking firms b capital requirements for all banks should be increased and those that could pose a threat to overall financial stability should be higher than others c there should be a greater emphasis on higher quality forms of capital common equity should constitute a “large majority” of a bank’s tier 1 capital d riskbased capital requirements should be a function of the relative risk e the procyclicality of the regulatory capital and accounting regimes should be reduced hold a larger buffer over banks’ minimum capital requirements during good times f banks should be subject to a simple nonriskbased leverage constraint g banks should be subject to a conservative explicit liquidity standard and h stricter capital and liquidity requirements for the banking system should not be allowed to result in the reemergence of an underregulated nonbank financial sector that poses a threat to financial stability 

the us department of the treasury issued this statement to facilitate the process of reaching a domestic and then international consensus on a new regulatory capital and liquidity regime for global banking firms the department of the treasury seeks to reach a comprehensive international agreement on the new global framework by dec 31 2010 with implementation of the reforms effective dec 31 2012 

prompt corrective action 

the fdi act as amended by the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 “fdicia” requires the federal banking agencies to take “prompt corrective action” in respect of depository institutions that do not meet specified capital requirements fdicia establishes five capital categories for fdicinsured banks wellcapitalized adequatelycapitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized a depository institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if the banking institution has a total riskbased capital ratio of 100 or greater a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of 60 or greater and a leverage ratio of 50 or greater and the institution is not subject to an order written agreement capital directive or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific level for any capital measure the fdi act imposes progressively more 

restrictive constraints on operations management and capital distributions depending on the capital category in which an institution is classified 

at dec 31 2009 all of our bank subsidiaries were wellcapitalized based on the ratios and guidelines noted above a bank’s capital category however is determined solely for the purpose of applying the prompt corrective action rules and may not be an accurate representation of the bank’s overall financial condition or prospects 

the appropriate federal banking agency may under certain circumstances reclassify a wellcapitalized insured depository institution as adequately capitalized the fdi act provides that an institution may be reclassified if the appropriate federal banking agency determines after notice and opportunity for hearing that the institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition or deems the institution to be engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice 

the appropriate agency is also permitted to require an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution to comply with the supervisory provisions as if the institution were in the next lower category but not treat a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized based on supervisory information other than the capital levels of the institution 

compensation practices 

our compensation practices are subject to oversight by the federal reserve board in october 2009 the federal reserve board issued a comprehensive proposal on incentive compensation policies that applies to all banking organizations supervised by the federal reserve board including bank holding companies such as bny mellon the proposal sets forth three key principles for incentive compensation arrangements that are designed to help ensure that incentive compensation plans do not encourage excessive risktaking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of banking organizations the three principles provide that a banking organization’s incentive compensation arrangements should provide incentives that do not encourage risktaking beyond the organization’s ability to effectively identify and manage risks be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management and be supported by strong corporate governance the proposal also contemplates a detailed review by the federal reserve board of the incentive compensation policies and practices of a number of “large complex banking

organizations” including us any deficiencies in compensation practices that are identified may be incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions the proposal provides that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related riskmanagement control or governance processes pose a risk to the organization’s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies the scope and content of the federal reserve board’s policies on executive compensation are continuing to develop and we expect that these policies will evolve over a number of years 

in september 2009 the financial stability board established by the leaders of the group of 20 released standards for implementing certain compensation principles for banks and other financial companies designed to encourage sound compensation practices these standards are to be implemented by local regulators thus far regulators in a number of countries including the united kingdom france and germany have proposed or adopted policies related to compensation at financial institutions these policies are in addition to the proposals made by the federal reserve board in october 2009 the united kingdom has announced a 50 tax on certain financial institutions in respect of discretionary bonuses in excess of £25000 awarded to “relevant banking employees” at such institutions between dec 9 2009 and april 5 2010 or awarded under arrangements made between those dates separately the fdic has solicited comments on whether to amend its riskbased deposit insurance assessment system to potentially increase assessment rates on financial institutions with compensation programs that put the dif at risk 

insolvency of an insured depository institution 

if the fdic is appointed the conservator or receiver of an insured depository institution such as the bank of new york mellon or bny mellon na upon its insolvency or in certain other events the fdic has the power 

 

  

 in addition under federal law the claims of holders of deposit liabilities and certain claims for administrative expenses against an insured depository institution would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution including claims of debt holders of the institution in the “liquidation or other resolution” of such an institution by any receiver as a result whether or not the fdic ever sought to repudiate any debt obligations of the bank of new york mellon or bny mellon na the debt holders would be treated differently from and could receive if anything substantially less than the depositors of the depository institution 

depositor preference 

under federal law depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses and employee compensation against an insured depository institution are afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution including federal funds and letters of credit in the “liquidation or other resolution” of such an institution by any receiver 

antimoney laundering and the usa patriot act 

a major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions in recent years has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing the usa patriot act of 2001 the “usa patriot act” substantially broadened the scope of us antimoney laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the us the us treasury department has proposed and in some cases issued a number of implementing regulations which apply various requirements of the usa patriot act to financial institutions such as bny mellon’s bank brokerdealer and investment adviser subsidiaries and mutual funds and private investment companies advised or sponsored by our subsidiaries those regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies procedures and controls to detect prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing

and to verify the identity of their customers certain of those regulations impose specific due diligence requirements on financial institutions that maintain correspondent or private banking relationships with nonus financial institutions or persons failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution 

assetbacked commercial paper liquidity facility program 

in september 2008 the federal reserve announced an asset backed commercial paper “abcp” money market mutual fund “mmmf” liquidity facility program the “abcp program” 

eligible borrowers under the abcp program include all us depository institutions us bank holding companies us branches and agencies of foreign banks and brokerdealers eligible borrowers were permitted to borrow funds under the abcp program in order to fund the purchase of eligible abcp from an mmmf the mmmf must be a fund that qualifies as a money market mutual fund under rule 2a7 of the ‘40 act abcp used for collateral in the abcp program must be rated no lower than a1 f1 or p1 us dollar denominated and from a us issuer the abcp program ended on feb 1 2010 

borrowings under the abcp program are nonrecourse further the abcp pledged under the abcp program receives a 0 risk weight for riskbased capital purposes and is excluded from average total consolidated assets for leverage capital purposes 

bny mellon repaid all borrowings related to this program in early 2009 

temporary guarantee program for money market mutual funds 

in september 2008 the us treasury department opened its temporary guarantee program for money market mutual funds the “temporary guarantee program” under which the us treasury guaranteed the share price of any publicly offered eligible money market fund that applied for and paid a fee to participate in the temporary guarantee program all money market funds that are 

structured within the confines of rule 2a7 of the ‘40 act that maintain a stable share price of 100 are publicly offered and are registered with the sec were eligible to participate in the temporary guarantee program 

the temporary guarantee program provided coverage to shareholders for amounts that they held in participating money market funds at the close of business on sept 19 2008 the guarantee was triggered if the market value of assets held in a participating fund fell below 0995 per share the fund’s sponsor chose not to maintain the 100 share price and the fund’s board determined to liquidate the fund each dreyfus and bny mellon funds trust money market fund entered into a guarantee agreement with the department of the treasury which permitted these funds to participate in the temporary guarantee program 

the temporary guarantee program was designed to address temporary dislocations in credit markets and initially was scheduled to run through dec 18 2008 the department of the treasury extended the temporary guarantee program until sept 18 2009 but chose not to further extend the program accordingly as of sept 18 2009 the program no longer provides any guarantee against loss to money market fund shareholders with respect to fund shares held 

us treasury program – investment in us financial institutions 

in october 2008 the us government announced the troubled asset relief program “tarp” capital purchase program “cpp” authorized under the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 “eesa” the intention of this program is to encourage us financial institutions to build capital to increase the flow of financing to us businesses and consumers and to support the us economy in connection with the cpp bny mellon issued 3 billion of fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock series b and a warrant for common stock to the us treasury in june 2009 we repurchased the series b preferred stock for 30 billion which reflects the liquidation value of the preferred stock bny mellon paid the us treasury an aggregate of approximately 95 million in dividends on the series b preferred shares from oct 28 2008 through the repurchase date in august 2009 we repurchased the warrant issued to the us treasury for 136 million

  money market investor funding facility 

in october 2008 the federal reserve board announced the creation of the money market investor funding facility “mmiff” which supports a privatesector initiative designed to provide liquidity to us money market investors 

under the mmiff the federal reserve bank of new york provided senior secured financing to a series of special purpose vehicles “spvs” that purchase high 

quality money market instruments maturing in 90 days or less from us money market funds eligible assets include us dollardenominated certificates of deposit and commercial paper issued by highly rated financial institutions and having remaining maturities of 90 days or less eligible investors include us money market mutual funds and over time may include other us money market investors in january 2009 the federal reserve board expanded the set of institutions eligible to participate in the mmiff from us money market mutual funds to also include usbased securities lending cash collateral reinvestment funds portfolios and accounts securities lenders and usbased investment funds that operate in a manner similar to money market mutual funds such as certain local government investment pools common trust funds and collective investment funds 

the mmiff became operational on nov 24 2008 with spvs becoming eligible to begin purchasing assets on that date the mmiff expired on oct 30 2009 

sec adopts money market fund reforms 

in february 2010 the sec adopted new rules intended to increase the resilience of money market funds to economic stresses and reduce the risks of runs on the funds by tightening maturity and credit quality standards and imposing new minimum liquidity requirements in part these rules a limit fund purchases of second tier securities securities of other than the highest credit quality to 3 of total net assets b establish minimum daily and weekly liquidity standards for funds 10 of a fund’s assets must be invested in “daily liquid assets” and 30 in “weekly liquid assets” which generally include cash us government securities or securities readily convertible to cash within one or five business days respectively c establish a general liquidity requirement and for funds to adopt related “know your investor” procedures d require funds to limit purchases of securities that are not “liquid assets” to 5 of total net assets e reduce maximum portfolio weighted average maturity from 90 days to 60 days f establish a maximum “weighted average life to maturity” of 120 days to reduce spread risk g require that funds

perform periodic stress tests of fund portfolios h enhance fund portfolio holdings disclosure requirements i mandate the ability to process investor redemption orders at a price of less than 1 and j empower fund boards to suspend redemptions if a fund is about to “break” the 1 share price and the board decides to liquidate the fund 

the sec commissioners in voting to approve these reforms indicated publicly that they anticipate a second round of rulemaking with additional reforms in the foreseeable future issues mentioned for consideration include a private liquidity facility for money market funds a floating net asset value “nav” money market fund to replace the fixed nav money market fund that is prevalent today a possible twotiered regulatory system for fixed and floating nav money market funds and other matters raised in president obama’s working group report once issued 

we believe that the reforms adopted by the sec in february 2010 will have a minimal impact on our money market mutual fund business however if further reforms of the type being contemplated by the sec commissioners are implemented they may have a greater effect on altering money market mutual funds industrywide 

privacy 

the privacy provisions of the grammleachbliley act generally prohibit financial institutions including bny mellon from disclosing nonpublic personal financial information of consumer customers to third parties for certain purposes primarily marketing unless customers have the opportunity to “opt out” of the disclosure the fair credit reporting act restricts information sharing among affiliates for marketing purposes 

community reinvestment act 

the community reinvestment act of 1977 requires us banks to help serve the credit needs of their communities including credit to low and moderate income individuals and geographies should bny mellon or its us bank subsidiaries fail to adequately serve these communities potential penalties could be imposed including regulatory denials to expand branches relocate add subsidiaries and affiliates expand into new financial activities and merge with or purchase other financial institutions 

  

acquisitions 

federal and state laws impose notice and approval requirements for mergers and acquisitions involving depository institutions or bank holding companies the bhc act requires the prior approval of the federal reserve board for the direct or indirect acquisition of more than 50 of any class of the voting shares or all or substantially all of the assets of a commercial bank savings and loan association or bank holding company in reviewing bank acquisition and merger applications the bank regulatory authorities will consider among other things the competitive effect of the transaction financial and managerial issues including the capital position of the combined organization convenience and needs factors including the applicant’s record under the community reinvestment act and the effectiveness of the subject organizations in combating money laundering activities in addition other acquisitions by bny mellon may be subject to informal notice and approval by the federal reserve board or other regulatory authorities 

legislative initiatives 

various legislative initiatives such as those discussed in this section are from time to time introduced in congress or relevant state legislatures we cannot determine the ultimate effect that any such potential legislation if enacted would have upon our financial condition or operations 

proposals to limit activities and size of financial institutions and tax large financial firms 

in january 2010 president obama announced two initiatives aimed at us financial institutions the first proposes to limit both the size and scope of us financial institutions the “volcker rule” the volcker rule would prohibit us banks bank holding companies and other depository institution holding companies from owning investing in or sponsoring hedge funds private equity funds and proprietary trading operations that are unrelated to serving client needs in addition the volcker rule seeks to limit the consolidation of the financial sector by restricting the growth of the market share of liabilities including nondeposit funding at the largest financial firms this limit would supplement existing caps on the market share of deposits 

the second proposal is a “financial crisis responsibility fee” a tax that would be levied on bank thrift and insurance companies and broker 

  

bny mellon 13

dealers with more than 50 billion in consolidated assets as currently proposed the fee would go into effect on june 30 2010 and would remain in force for 10 years or longer the fee would be calculated on total assets excluding tier 1 capital and assessed deposits based on the amounts of assets on its balance sheet at dec 31 2009 bny mellon estimates that it would be responsible for paying approximately 200 million annually under this proposal if enacted as currently proposed 

financial regulatory reform continues to be a top priority for the obama administration the us house of representatives the “house” passed the “wall street reform and consumer protection act” on dec 11 2009 the us senate has not yet enacted legislation in this area the senate banking committee draft bill “restoring american financial stability act of 2009” is still in draft form and currently under discussion both legislative products focus on measures to improve financial stability provide for more effective bank supervision enhance the regulation of consumer financial products and services through the establishment of a consumer financial protection agency and allow for better coordination between regulatory agencies the house’s bill would establish a systemic dissolution fund to help wind down financial institutions when necessary the fund would be prefunded by fdic assessments on large financial companies with assets exceeding 50 billion to pay for the resolution of a bank holding company a systemically important financial company an insurance company or any other financial company the senate banking committee’s draft proposal has a similar resolution mechanism and sets the threshold at 10 billion or more 

competition 

bny mellon is subject to intense competition in all aspects and areas of our business our asset management and wealth management business segments experience competition from asset management firms hedge funds investment banking companies bank and financial holding companies banks including trust banks brokerage firms and insurance companies these firms and companies may be domiciled domestically or internationally our asset servicing clearing and treasury services business segments compete with domestic and foreign banks that offer institutional trust custody products and cash management products as well as a wide range of technologically capable service providers such as data processing and shareholder 

service firms and other firms that rely on automated data transfer services for institutional and retail customers 

many of our competitors with the particular exception of bank and financial holding companies banks and trust companies are not subject to regulation as extensive as that described under the “supervision and regulation” section and as a result may have a competitive advantage over us and our subsidiaries in certain respects 

as a result of current conditions in the global financial markets and the economy in general competition could intensify and consolidation of financial service companies could increase 

as part of our business strategy we seek to distinguish ourselves from competitors by the level of service we deliver to our clients we also believe that technological innovation is an important competitive factor and for this reason have made and continue to make substantial investments in this area the ability to recover quickly from unexpected events is a competitive factor and we have devoted significant resources to this see item 1a “risk factors – competition” below which is incorporated into this item by reference

 item 1a risk factors 

making or continuing an investment in securities issued by us including our common stock involves certain risks that you should carefully consider the following discussion sets forth some of the more 

important risk factors that could affect our business financial condition or results of operations however other factors besides those discussed below or elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k or other of our reports filed with or furnished to the sec also could adversely affect our business or results we cannot assure you that the risk factors described below or elsewhere in this document are a complete set of all potential risks that we may face these risk factors also serve to describe factors which may cause our results to differ materially from those described in forwardlooking statements included herein or in other documents or statements that make reference to this annual report on form 10k see “forwardlooking statements” 

current uncertainties in the global financial markets and the economy generally may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the domestic and global financial markets and the economy generally both in the us and elsewhere around the world while there are indications that both the financial markets and the economy have recovered somewhat from the recent worldwide recession there appear to remain depressed home prices and increasing foreclosures volatile equity market values high unemployment declining business and consumer confidence and the risk of increased inflation these factors continue to have a significant effect on both the global economy and our business the resulting economic pressure on consumers and lack of confidence in the financial markets may adversely affect certain portions of our business and our financial condition and results of operations a worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on us and others in the financial institutions industry in particular we may face the following risks in connection with these events 

 

   

  

bny mellon 17

       levels of market volatility have been unprecedented 

the capital and credit markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption for more than two years while markets have stabilized in recent months further upheaval could produce downward 

pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers’ underlying financial strength under these extreme conditions hedging and other risk management strategies may not be as effective at mitigating trading losses as they would be under less volatile market conditions moreover under these conditions market participants are particularly exposed to trading strategies employed by many market participants simultaneously and on a large scale such as crowded trades our risk management and monitoring processes seek to quantify and mitigate risk to more extreme market moves severe market events have historically been difficult to predict however and we could realize significant losses if unprecedented extreme market events were to continue such as the recent conditions in the global financial markets and global economy see the “risk management” section of the annual report which is incorporated herein by reference 

if markets experience further upheavals there can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse effect which may be material on our ability to access capital and on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may experience further writedowns of our financial instruments and other losses related to volatile and illiquid market conditions  impairment of our instruments could harm our earnings 

we maintain an investment securities portfolio of various holdings types and maturities these securities are generally classified as availableforsale and consequently are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax our portfolio consists of nonagency residential mortgagebacked securities commercial mortgagebacked securities and credit cards the values of which are subject to market price volatility to the extent unhedged if such investments suffer credit losses as we experienced with some of our investments in fiscal 2009 we may recognize in earnings the credit losses as an otherthantemporary impairment for information regarding the sensitivity of and risks associated with the market value of portfolio investments and interest rates refer to the section titled “market risk” in our annual report which section is incorporated herein by reference 

competition—we are subject to intense competition in all aspects of our business which could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability

part i continued 

 

  

many businesses in which we operate are intensely competitive around the world other domestic and international banks and financial service companies such as trading firms broker dealers investment banks specialized processing companies outsourcing companies data processing companies and asset managers aggressively compete with us for feebased business we also face competition from both unregulated and regulated financial services organizations such as mutual funds insurance companies credit unions money market funds and investment counseling firms whose products and services span the local national and global markets in which we conduct operations in addition insurance companies investment counseling firms brokerage houses and other business firms and individuals offer active competition for personal trust services and investment counseling services 

regulators have recently put forward various proposals that may impact our ability to conduct certain of our businesses in a costeffective manner or at all including proposals relating to restrictions on the type of activities in which financial institutions are permitted to engage and the size of financial institutions and proposals to impose additional taxes on certain financial institutions these or other similar proposals which may not apply to all of our competitors could adversely impact our ability to compete effectively 

dependence on feebased business—we are dependent on feebased business for a substantial majority of our revenue and our feebased revenues could be adversely affected by a slowing in capital market activity significant declines in market values or negative trends in savings rates or in individual investment preferences 

our principal operational focus is on feebased business as distinct from commercial banking institutions that earn most of their revenues from traditional interestgenerating products and services we have redeployed our assets away from traditional retail banking to concentrate our resources further on feebased businesses including cash management custody mutual fund services unit investment trusts corporate trust depositary receipts stock transfer securities execution and clearance collateral management and asset management 

fees for many of our products and services are based on the volume of transactions processed the market value of assets managed and administered securities lending 

volume and spreads and fees for other services rendered corporate actions crossborder investing global mergers and acquisitions activity new debt and equity issuances and secondary trading volumes all affect the level of our revenues 

assetbased fees are typically determined on a sliding scale so that as the value of a client portfolio grows we receive a smaller percentage of the increasing value as fee income this is particularly important to our asset management global funds services and global custody businesses significant declines in the values of capital assets would reduce the market value of some of the assets that we manage and administer and result in a corresponding decrease in the amount of fees we receive and therefore would have an adverse effect on our results of operations similarly significant declines in the volume of capital markets activity would reduce the number of transactions we process and the amount of securities lending we do and therefore would also have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

pricing pressures as a result of the ability of competitors to offer comparable or improved products or services at a lower price and customer pricing reviews may result in a reduction in the price we can charge for our products and services which would likely negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability 

our business generally benefits when individuals invest their savings in mutual funds and other collective funds in defined benefit plans unit investment trusts or exchange traded funds if there is a decline in the savings rates of individuals or if there is a change in investment preferences that leads to less investment in mutual funds other collective funds and defined contribution plans our revenues could be adversely affected 

our feebased revenues could be adversely affected by a stable exchangerate environment or decreased crossborder investing activity 

the degree of volatility in foreign exchange rates can affect the amount of our foreign exchange trading revenue most of our foreign exchange revenue is derived from our securities servicing client base activity levels and spreads are generally higher when there is more volatility accordingly we benefit from currency volatility and our foreign exchange revenue is likely to decrease during times of decreased currency volatility 

  

bny mellon 19 

part i continued 

 

  

our future revenue may increase or decrease depending upon the extent of increases or decreases in crossborder or other investments made by our clients economic and political uncertainties resulting from terrorist attacks military actions or other events including changes in laws or regulations governing crossborder transactions such as currency controls could result in decreased crossborder investment activity decreased crossborder investing could lead to decreased demand for investor services that we provide 

the trend towards use of electronic trade networks instead of traditional modes of exchange may result in unfavorable pressure on our foreign exchange business which could adversely impact our foreign exchange revenue 

our ability to retain existing business and obtain new business is dependent on our consistent execution of the feebased services we perform 

we provide custody accounting daily pricing and administration master trust and master custody investment management trustee and recordkeeping foreign exchange securities lending securities execution and clearance correspondent clearing stock transfer cash management trading and information services to clients worldwide assets under custody and assets under management are held by us in a custodial or fiduciary capacity and are not included in our assets if we fail to perform these services in a manner consistent with our fiduciary custodial and other obligations existing and potential clients may lose confidence in our ability to properly perform these services and our business may be adversely affected in addition any such failure may result in contingent liabilities that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or losses that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

our internal strategies and forecasts assume a growing client base and increasing client usage of our services a decline in the pace at which we attract new clients and a decline of the pace at which existing and new clients use additional services and assign additional assets to us for management or custody would adversely affect our future results of operations a decline in the rate at which our clients outsource functions such as their internal accounts payable activities would also adversely affect our results of operations 

  

strategic acquisitions may pose integration risks 

from time to time to achieve our strategic objectives we have acquired or invested in other companies or businesses and may do so in the future each of these poses integration challenges including successfully retaining clients and key employees of both businesses and capitalizing on certain revenue synergies we cannot assure you that we will realize when anticipated or at all the positive benefits expected as a result of our acquisitions or that any businesses acquired will be successfully integrated 

the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us 

our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients as a result defaults by or even rumors or questions about one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally have led to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparties or clients in addition our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us there is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

any material reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets 

our longterm debt is currently rated investment grade by the major rating agencies these rating agencies regularly evaluate us and their ratings of our longterm debt are based on a number of factors including our financial strength as well as factors not entirely within our control including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally 

in addition rating agencies may employ different models and formulas to assess the financial strength 

  

20 bny mellon 

part i continued 

 

  

of a rated company and from time to time rating agencies have in their discretion altered these models changes to the models general economic conditions or other circumstances outside our control could impact a rating agency’s judgment of its rating and the rating it assigns us in view of the difficulties experienced recently by many financial institutions we believe that the rating agencies may heighten the level of scrutiny that they apply to such institutions may increase the frequency and scope of their credit reviews may request additional information from the companies that they rate and may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels 

the outcome of such a review may have adverse ratings consequences which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding and increase our cost of capital we cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take or what actions we may be required to take in response to the actions of rating agencies which may adversely affect us 

interest rate environment—our revenues and profits are sensitive to changes in interest rates 

our net interest revenue and cash flows are sensitive to interest rate changes and changes in valuations in the debt or equity markets over which we have no control our net interest revenue is the difference between the interest income earned on our interestearning assets such as the loans we make and the securities we hold in our investment portfolio and the interest expense incurred on our interestbearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed money we also earn net interest revenue on interestfree funds we hold 

the global market crisis has triggered a series of cuts in interest rates during fiscal 2009 the federal open market committee kept the target federal funds rate between 0 and 025 the low interest rate environment has compressed our net interest spread and reduced our spreadbased revenues it has also resulted in our voluntarily waiving fees on certain money market mutual funds and related distribution fees in order to prevent our clients’ yields on such funds from becoming negative changes in interest rates could affect the interest earned on assets differently than interest paid on liabilities a rising interest rate environment generally results in our earning a larger net interest spread conversely a falling interest rate environment generally 

results in our earning a smaller net interest spread if we are unable to effectively manage our interest rate risk changes in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our profitability further volatility in interest rates could trigger one or more of the following additional effects 

 

     a more detailed discussion of the interest rate and market risks we face is contained in the “risk management” section of the annual report which is incorporated herein by reference 

capital adequacy—we are subject to capital adequacy guidelines and if we fail to meet these guidelines our financial condition would be adversely affected 

under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines and other regulatory requirements bny mellon and our subsidiary banks and brokerdealers must meet guidelines that include quantitative measures of assets liabilities and certain offbalance sheet items subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components risk weightings and other factors from time to time the regulators implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy guidelines if our company our subsidiary banks or brokerdealers failed to meet these minimum capital guidelines and other regulatory requirements their respective financial conditions would be materially and adversely affected in light of recent market events proposed regulations including president obama’s recent proposal to limit the market share of liabilities

at large financial firms and proposed changes in regulatory accords on international banking institutions formulated by the basel committee on banking supervision and implemented by the federal reserve board bny mellon and our subsidiary banks may be required to satisfy additional more stringent capital adequacy standards we cannot fully predict the final form of or the effects of these regulations failure by our largest subsidiary to maintain its status as “wellcapitalized” and “well managed” if unremedied over a period of time would cause us to lose our status as a fhc and could affect the confidence of clients in us thus also compromising our competitive position see “supervision and regulation” above and “liquidity and dividends” “capital — capital framework” and “— capital adequacy” in the annual report which portions are incorporated herein by reference 

access to capital markets—if our ability to access the capital markets is diminished our business may be adversely affected 

our business is dependent in part on our ability to access successfully the capital markets on a regular basis we rely on access to both shortterm money markets and longterm capital markets as significant sources of liquidity to the extent liquidity requirements are not satisfied by the cash flow from our consolidated operations events or circumstances such as rising interest rates market disruptions or loss of confidence of debt purchasers or counterparties in us or in the funds markets could limit our access to capital markets increase our cost of borrowing adversely affect our liquidity or impair our ability to execute our business plan in addition our ability to raise funding could be impaired if lenders develop a negative perception of our longterm or shortterm financial prospects such negative perceptions could be developed if we incur large trading losses we are downgraded or put on or remain on negative watch by the rating agencies we suffer a decline in the level of our business activity regulatory authorities take significant action against us or we discover significant employee misconduct or illegal activity among other reasons if we are unable to raise funding using the methods described above we would likely need to finance or liquidate unencumbered assets such as our investment and trading portfolios to meet maturing liabilities we may be unable to sell some of our assets or we may have to sell assets at a discount from market value either of which could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision including regulation and supervision in nonus jurisdictions 

we operate in a highly regulated environment being subject to a comprehensive statutory regulatory regime as well as oversight by governmental agencies in light of the current conditions in the global financial markets and economy the obama administration congress and regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry failure to comply with laws regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies civil money penalties and reputational damage which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations although we have policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur laws regulations or policies including accounting standards and interpretations currently affecting us and our subsidiaries may change at any time regulatory authorities may also change their interpretation of these statutes and regulations therefore our business may be adversely affected by future changes in laws regulations policies or interpretations or regulatory approaches to compliance and enforcement see “supervision and regulation” above some of the governmental authorities which may assert jurisdictional regulatory authority over us are located in and operate under jurisdictions outside the united states such jurisdictions may utilize legal principles and systems that differ materially from those encountered in the united states among other things litigation in foreign jurisdictions may be decided much more quickly than in the us trials may not involve testimony of witnesses who are in the courtroom and subject to crossexamination and trials may be based solely on submission of written materials these factors can make issues of regulatory compliance and legal proceedings more difficult to assess 

recent legislative and regulatory initiatives may significantly impact our financial condition operations capital position and ability to pursue business opportunities 

the recent economic and political environment has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives both enacted and proposed that could substantially intensify the regulation of the financial services industry and may significantly impact us for example the obama administration congress and our

regulators are currently considering a variety of proposals that would make far reaching changes to the financial regulatory system and significantly affect the financial services industry including the volcker rule which would prohibit banks and financial institutions from owning investing or sponsoring a hedge fund or private equity fund or engaging in proprietary trading operations for their own profit unrelated to serving customers increased capital requirements for banks and other financial institutions and even higher capital requirements for systemically important financial firms such as bny mellon and the imposition of formulaic liquidity requirements as proposed by the basel committee and discussed above under “supervision and regulation” limitations on the size of large banking institutions including allowing regulators to dismantle large or systemically important banks and financial institutions even healthy ones if they are considered a grave risk to the economy limits on the growth of market share of liabilities a “financial crisis responsibility fee” proposed by the obama administration on covered liabilities of the largest us financial institutions including bny mellon that would be assessed for at least the next ten years heightened standards for and increased scrutiny of the compensation practices of financial institutions a new financial services oversight council chaired by the us treasury secretary a consumer financial protection agency potential limits on the scope of federal preemption of state laws as applied to national banks greater powers to regulate risk across the financial system new requirements for the securitizations market changes in the regulatory agencies and rules to more closely regulate credit default swaps and other derivative transactions the proposals generally call for increased scrutiny and regulation for financial firms whose combination of size leverage and interconnectedness could pose a threat to financial stability if they were to fail additionally substantial regulatory and legislative initiatives including a comprehensive overhaul of the regulatory system in the us are possible in the years ahead 

these legislative and regulatory initiatives could require us to change certain of our business practices impose additional costs on us limit the products that we offer result in a loss of revenue limit our competitiveness or our ability to pursue business opportunities cause business disruptions impact the value of assets that we hold or otherwise adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition the longterm impact of these initiatives on our business practices and revenues 

will depend upon the successful implementation of our strategies and competitors’ responses to such initiatives all of which are difficult to predict for more information regarding the regulatory environment in which we operate see “supervision and regulation” above 

monetary and other governmental policies—our business is influenced by monetary and other governmental policies 

the monetary tax and other policies of the government and its agencies including the federal reserve have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance due to current market conditions we anticipate that monetary tax and other government policies will become more rigorous heightened regulatory scrutiny and increased sanctions changes or potential changes in domestic and international legislation and regulation as well as domestic or international regulatory investigations impose compliance legal review and response costs that may impact our profitability and may allow additional competition facilitate consolidation of competitors or attract new competitors into our businesses the cost of geographically diversifying and maintaining our facilities to comply with regulatory mandates necessarily results in additional costs various legislative initiatives are from time to time introduced in congress or relevant state legislatures we cannot determine the ultimate effect that any such potential legislation if enacted would have upon our financial condition or operations see “supervision and regulation” above 

operational risk—we are exposed to operational risk as a result of providing certain services which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we are exposed to operational risk as a result of providing various feebased services including certain securities servicing global payment services private banking and asset management services operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from errors related to transaction processing breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements fraud by employees or persons outside the company business interruption due to system failures or other events or other risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes people and systems or from external events including legal risk we regularly assess and monitor operational risk in our business and provide for disaster and business recovery planning including geographical diversification of our facilities however the 

  

bny mellon 23 

part i continued 

 

  

occurrence of various events including unforeseeable and unpreventable events such as hurricanes or other natural disasters could still damage our physical facilities or our computer systems or software cause delay or disruptions to operational functions impair our clients vendors and counterparties and negatively impact our results of operations operational risk also includes potential legal or regulatory actions that could arise as a result of noncompliance with applicable laws and regulatory requirements which could have an adverse effect on our reputation see “risk management” in the annual report which portion is incorporated herein by reference 

reputational and legal risk—our business may be negatively affected by adverse publicity regulatory actions or litigation with respect to us other wellknown companies and the financial services industry generally 

adverse publicity and damage to our reputation arising from the recent events in the financial markets our failure or perceived failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements actions of errant employees financial reporting irregularities involving ourselves or other large and well known companies increasing regulatory scrutiny of “know your customer” antimoney laundering and antiterrorist procedures and their effectiveness regulatory investigations of the mutual fund industry including mutual funds advised by us and litigation that arises from the failure or perceived failure of us to comply with compliance policies and procedures could result in increased regulatory supervision affect our ability to attract and retain customers or maintain access to the capital markets result in suits enforcement actions fines and penalties or have adverse effects on us in ways that are not predictable investigations by various federal and state regulatory agencies the department of justice and state attorneys general and any related litigation could have an adverse effect on investment activity generally and on us such investigations also may be initiated by and other compliance requirements may be asserted by jurisdictions outside the united states utilizing legal principles and systems that differ materially from those encountered in the united states see item 3 of this form 10k 

our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented 

management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls disclosure controls and procedures and 

corporate governance policies and procedures any system of controls however well designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system are met any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 

we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business any failure interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management general ledger deposit loan and other systems while we have policies procedures and technical safeguards designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure interruption or security breach of our information systems there can be no assurance that any such failures interruptions or security breaches will not occur or if they do occur that they will be adequately addressed the occurrence of any failures interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation result in a loss of customer business subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations see “risk management” in the annual report which portion of the annual report is incorporated herein by reference 

technology—we depend on our technology and intellectual property if third parties misappropriate our intellectual property our business may be adversely affected 

we are dependent on technology because many of our products and services involve processing large volumes of data our technology platforms must therefore provide global capabilities and scale rapid technological changes require significant and ongoing investments in technology to develop competitive new products and services or adopt new technologies technological advances which result in lower transaction costs may adversely impact our revenues in addition unsuccessful implementation of technological upgrades and new products may adversely impact our ability to service and retain customers

part i continued 

 

  

developments in the securities processing industry including shortened settlement cycles and straightthroughprocessing will necessitate ongoing changes to our business and operations and will likely require additional investment in technology our financial performance depends in part on our ability to develop and market new and innovative services to adopt or develop new technologies that differentiate our products or provide cost efficiencies and to deliver these products and services to the market in a timely manner at a competitive price 

rapid technological change in the financial services industry together with competitive pressures require us to make significant and ongoing investments we cannot provide any assurance that our technology spending will achieve gains in competitiveness or profitability and the costs we incur in product development could be substantial accordingly we could incur substantial development costs without achieving corresponding gains in profitability 

we use trademark trade secret copyright and other proprietary rights and procedures to protect our intellectual property and technology resources despite our efforts we cannot be certain that the steps we take to prevent unauthorized use of our proprietary rights are sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our technology particularly in foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states in addition we cannot be sure that courts will adequately enforce contractual arrangements we have entered into to protect our proprietary technologies if any of our proprietary information were misappropriated by or otherwise disclosed to our competitors our competitive position could be adversely affected we may incur substantial costs to defend ownership of our intellectual property or to replace misappropriated proprietary technology if a third party were to assert a claim of infringement of our proprietary rights obtained through patents or otherwise against us with respect to one or more of our methods of doing business or conducting our operations we could be required to spend significant amounts to defend such claims develop alternative methods of operations pay substantial money damages or obtain a license from the third party 

acts of terrorism—acts of terrorism may have a negative impact on our business 

acts of terrorism could have a significant impact on our business and operations while we have in place business 

continuity and disaster recovery plans acts of terrorism could still damage our facilities and disrupt or delay normal operations and have a similar impact on our clients suppliers and counterparties acts of terrorism and global conflicts could also negatively impact the purchase of our products and services to the extent they resulted in reduced capital markets activity lower asset price levels or disruptions in general economic activity in the united states or abroad or in financial market settlement functions the wars in iraq and afghanistan the recent terror attacks in pune and mumbai india global conflicts the national and global efforts to combat terrorism and other potential military activities and outbreaks of hostilities have affected and may further adversely affect economic growth and may have other adverse effects on us in ways that we are necessarily unable to predict 

our subsidiaries are subject to claims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibility 

from time to time customers of our subsidiaries may make claims and take legal action pertaining to performance of fiduciary responsibilities whether customer claims and legal action related to the subsidiary’s performance of its fiduciary responsibilities are founded or unfounded if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to the subsidiary they may result in material financial liability and materially impair the market perception of us and our products and services in addition in the performance of fiduciary duties or other contractual responsibilities our subsidiaries may be required to withhold applicable taxes on income distributions to foreign and domestic persons in the event such withholding were to be determined to have not been conducted in a manner supported by appropriate documentation we could be subject to liability 

new lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks 

from time to time we may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business there are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed in developing and marketing new lines of business andor new products and services we may invest significant time and resources initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business andor new products or services

may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible 

we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract new employees retain and motivate our existing employees and continue to compensate employees competitively amid intense public and regulatory scrutiny on the compensation practices of large financial institutions competition for the best people in most activities engaged in by us can be intense and we may not be able to hire people or to retain them 

tax laws and regulations—tax law changes or challenges to our tax positions with respect to historical transactions may adversely affect our net income effective tax rate and our overall results of operations and financial condition 

in the course of our business we receive inquiries from both us and nonus tax authorities on the amount of taxes we owe such as those matters discussed in note 26 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report which is incorporated herein by reference if we are not successful in defending these inquiries we may be required to adjust the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions all of which can require a greater provision for taxes or otherwise negatively affect earnings probabilities and outcomes are reviewed as events unfold and adjustments to the reserves are made when necessary but the reserves may prove inadequate because we cannot necessarily accurately predict the outcome of any challenge settlement or litigation or to what extent it will negatively affect us or our business in addition changes in tax legislation or the interpretation of existing tax laws worldwide could have a material impact on our net income 

accounting principles—changes in accounting standards could have a material impact on our financial statements 

from time to time the financial accounting standards board the sec and bank regulators change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of our financial statements in some cases we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in our restating prior period financial statements these changes are difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations and other 

financial data although in certain instances these changes may not have an economic impact on our business 

for example the financial accounting standards board “fasb” recently issued sfas no 167 “amendments to fasb interpretation no 46 r” effective january 2010 sfas no 167 requires certain of our variable interest entities to be consolidated which will increase our balance sheet and subject us to additional capital requirements see “recent accounting and regulatory developments” in the annual report which portion is incorporated herein by reference further revisions to sfas no 167 may have an additional impact on us which cannot be predicted at this time 

credit reserves—we could incur income statement charges if our reserves for credit losses including loan reserves are inadequate 

we have credit exposure to residential mortgages the airline automotive and telecommunications industries monoline financial guaranty insurers and many other industries we cannot provide any assurance as to whether chargeoffs related to these sectors or to different credit risks may occur in the future though credit risk is inherent in lending activities our revenues and profitability are adversely affected when our borrowers default in whole or in part on their loan obligations to us we rely on our business experience to estimate future defaults which we use to create loan loss reserves against our loan portfolio in addition current market developments may increase default and delinquency rates which may impact our chargeoffs we cannot provide any assurance that these reserves based on management estimates will not be required to be augmented due to an unexpectedly high level of defaults if reserves for credit losses are not sufficient we would be required to record a larger credit loss reserve against current earnings 

holding company—we are a holding company and as a result are dependent on dividends from our subsidiaries including our subsidiary banks to meet our obligations including our obligations with respect to our debt securities and to provide funds for payment of dividends to our shareholders 

we are a nonoperating holding company whose principal assets and sources of income are our 

  

26 bny mellon 

part i continued 

 

  

principal bank subsidiaries – the bank of new york mellon and bny mellon na – and our other subsidiaries we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our banks and other subsidiaries and therefore we rely primarily on dividends and interest from these banking and other subsidiaries to meet our obligations including our obligations with respect to our debt securities and to provide funds for payment of dividends to our shareholders to the extent declared by our board of directors there are various legal limitations on the extent to which these banking and other subsidiaries can finance or otherwise supply funds to us by dividend or otherwise and certain of our affiliates for example as a result of charges related to the restructuring of our securities portfolio in the third quarter of 2009 the bank of new york mellon and bny mellon na will require regulatory consent prior to paying a dividend to us although we maintain cash positions for liquidity at the holding company level if these banking subsidiaries or other of our subsidiaries were unable to supply us with cash over time we could be unable to meet our obligations including our obligations with respect to our debt securities or declare or pay dividends in respect of our capital stock see “supervision and regulation” above and “liquidity and dividends” in the annual report which portions are incorporated herein by reference 

because we are a holding company our rights and the rights of our creditors including the holders of our debt securities to a share of the assets of any subsidiary upon the liquidation or recapitalization of the subsidiary will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors including in the case of our banking subsidiaries their depositors except to the extent that we may ourselves be a creditor with recognized claims against the subsidiary the rights of holders of our debt securities to benefit from those distributions will also be junior to those prior claims consequently our debt securities will be effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries a holder of our debt securities should look only to our assets for payments in respect of those debt securities 

limits on common stock dividends 

holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock we are not required to do so as a result of charges relating to the restructuring of the securities portfolio any 

increase in bny mellon’s ongoing quarterly dividend would require consultation with the federal reserve any reduction of or the elimination of our common stock dividend in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

antitakeover provisions could negatively impact our stockholders 

provisions of delaware law and provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or have the effect of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire control of us additionally our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue additional series of preferred stock and such preferred stock could be issued as a defensive measure in response to a takeover proposal these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if an acquisition might be in the best interest of our stockholders

the bank of new york mellon corporation nyse symbol bk is a global financial services company headquartered in new york new york with approximately 928 billion in assets under management and 202 trillion in assets under custody and administration for a further discussion of the company’s products and services see the “overview” and “business segments review” sections in the “management’s discussion and analysis of the company’s financial condition and results of operations” “mda” section in the annual report which portions of the annual report are incorporated herein by reference see “available information” on page 1 of this form 10k for a description of how to access financial and other information regarding the company which is incorporated herein by reference 

we were originally formed as a holding company for the bank of new york mellon which has its executive offices in new york with its predecessors the company has been in business since 1784 

on july 1 2008 we completed the process of consolidating and renaming our principal us bank and trust company subsidiaries into two principal banks this consolidation effort was an essential part of our overall merger and integration process 

the two principal banks resulting from the consolidation of the entities which mainly were us banks and trust companies are

the ability of the company’s bank subsidiaries to pay dividends to the company may also be affected by various minimum capital requirements for banking organizations as described below in addition the company’s right to participate in the assets or earnings of a subsidiary is subject to the prior claims of creditors of the subsidiary 

transactions with affiliates 

there are certain restrictions on the ability of the company and certain of its nonbank affiliates to borrow from and engage in other transactions with its bank subsidiaries in general these restrictions require that any extensions of credit must be secured by designated amounts of specified collateral and are limited as to any one of the company or such nonbank affiliates to 10 of the lending bank’s capital stock and surplus and as to the company and all such nonbank affiliates in the aggregate to 20 of such lending bank’s capital stock and surplus these restrictions other than the 10 of capital limit on covered transactions with any one affiliate are also applied to transactions between banks and their financial subsidiaries in addition certain bank transactions with affiliates must be on terms and conditions including credit standards that are substantially the same or at least as favorable to the bank as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions involving other nonaffiliated companies or in the absence of comparable transactions on terms and conditions including credit standards that in good faith would be offered to or would apply to nonaffiliated companies 

unsafe and unsound practices 

the federal banking agencies have authority to prohibit the national banks they supervise from engaging in any activity which in the appropriate agency’s opinion constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting the bank’s business the federal reserve board has similar authority with respect to the company and our nonbank subsidiaries in addition the nysbd also has similar authority with respect to the bank of new york mellon 

deposit insurance 

the deposits of our bank subsidiaries have the benefit of fdic insurance up to the applicable limits the fdic’s deposit insurance fund the “dif” is funded by assessments on insured depository 

institutions which depend on the risk category of an institution and the amount of insured deposits that it holds the fdic may increase or decrease the assessment rate during 2008 the assessment rates ranged from 005 per 100 of domestic deposits in the lower risk category to 043 per 100 of domestic deposits for banks in the highest risk category our banks were assessed approximately 005 per 100 of domestic deposits for 2008 the fdic increased the dif assessment rates for the first quarter of 2009 with the new rates ranging from 012 per 100 of domestic deposits in the lower risk category to 050 per 100 of domestic deposits for banks in the highest risk category an fdic credit available to our bank subsidiaries for prior contributions offset the entire assessment for the first quarter of 2008 and 90 of the assessment for the remaining quarters of 2008 and will offset some of the assessment for 2009 significant increases in the insurance assessments of our bank subsidiaries will increase our costs once the credit is fully utilized or otherwise disposed of 

see page 11 for a discussion of deposit insurance related to the fdic’s temporary liquidity guarantee program 

in addition the deposit insurance fund act of 1996 authorizes the financing corporation “fico” to impose assessments on dif assessable deposits in order to service the interest on fico’s bond obligations the amount assessed on individual institutions by fico is in addition to the amount if any paid for deposit insurance under the fdic’s riskrelated assessment rate schedule fico assessment rates may be adjusted quarterly to reflect a change in assessment base the fico annual assessment rate for the fourth quarter of 2008 was 00110 per 100 of domestic deposits and will be 00114 for the first quarter of 2009 

under the fdi act insurance of deposits may be terminated by the fdic upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law regulation rule order or condition imposed by a bank’s federal regulatory agency 

source of strength 

under the bhc act and federal reserve board policy the company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to its bank subsidiaries and to commit capital

part i continued 

 

 

and financial resources to those subsidiaries the required support may be needed at times when absent that federal reserve board policy we may not find ourselves able to provide it in addition any loans by the company to its bank subsidiaries would be subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of its banks the company’s us nonbank subsidiaries engaged in securitiesrelated activities are regulated by the securities and exchange commission “sec” 

liability of commonly controlled institutions and related matters 

the fdi act contains a “crossguarantee” provision that could result in any insured depository institution owned by the company being assessed for losses incurred by the fdic in connection with assistance provided to or the failure of any other insured depository institution owned by the company 

any loans by a bank holding company to a bank subsidiary that qualify as regulatory capital of the bank subsidiary are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the bank subsidiary in the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment 

in addition under the national bank act if the capital stock of a national bank is impaired by losses or otherwise the occ is authorized to require payment of the deficiency by assessment upon the bank’s shareholders pro rata  and to the extent necessary if any such assessment is not paid by any shareholder after three months notice to sell the stock of such shareholder to make good the deficiency 

regulatory capital 

the federal bank regulatory authorities have substantially similar riskbased capital and leverage ratio guidelines for banking organizations the guidelines are intended to ensure that banking organizations have adequate capital given the risk levels of their assets and offbalance sheet financial instruments 

the riskbased capital guidelines currently applicable to bank holding companies are based on the 1988 capital accord “basel i” of the basel committee on banking supervision the “basel committee” as discussed further below the federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted new riskbased capital guidelines for “core banks” including the company based upon the revised framework for the international convergence of capital measurement and capital standards “basel ii” issued by the basel committee in june 2004 and updated in november 2005 

under the existing basel ibased guidelines the riskbased capital ratio is determined by dividing the components of capital described further below by riskadjusted assets including certain offbalance sheet items such as standby letters of credit riskadjusted assets are determined by classifying assets and certain offbalance sheet items into weighted categories the required minimum ratio of “total capital” the sum of tier i tier ii and tier iii capital to riskadjusted assets including certain offbalance sheet items such as standby letters of credit is currently 8 the required minimum ratio of tier i capital to riskadjusted assets is 4 at dec 31 2008 the company’s total capital and tier i capital to riskadjusted assets ratios were 171 and 133 respectively under both the existing basel ibased guidelines and the basel iibased guidelines that are coming into effect a banking organization’s total capital is divided into tiers “tier i capital” consists of 1 common equity 2 qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock 3 for bank holding companies but not banks a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock 4 minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries and 5 for banking holding companies but not banks a limited amount of trust preferred securities less goodwill and certain other intangible assets not more than 25 of qualifying tier i capital may consist of cumulative perpetual preferred stock trustpreferred securities and other socalled “restricted core capital elements” effective march 31 2009 not more than 15 of our qualifying tier i capital may consist of trustpreferred securities we expect all of our trustpreferred securities to qualify as tier i capital at march 31 2009 the series b preferred stock that we issued to the us treasury counts as tier i capital and is not a restricted core capital element notwithstanding that it has a step up in dividends and bears dividends cumulatively see “us treasury program – investment in us financial institutions” below 

  

the bank of new york mellon corporation 7

“ tier ii capital” consists of hybrid capital instruments perpetual debt mandatory convertible debt securities a limited amount of subordinated debt preferred stock that does not qualify as tier i capital a limited amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses and a limited amount of unrealized gains on equity securities “ tier iii capital” consists of qualifying unsecured subordinated debt the sum of tier ii and tier iii capital may not exceed the amount of tier i capital 

the riskbased capital requirements identify concentration of credit risk and certain risks arising from nontraditional activities and the management of those risks as important factors to consider in assessing an institution’s overall capital adequacy in addition the riskbased capital guidelines incorporate a measure for market risk in foreign exchange and commodity activities and in the trading of debt and equity instruments the market riskbased capital guidelines require banking organizations with large trading activities to maintain capital for market risk in an amount calculated by using the banking organizations’ own internal valueatrisk models subject to parameters set by the regulators 

the federal bank regulatory agencies adopted the basel ii capital guidelines effective april 1 2008 the new guidelines are mandatory for “core” banks the company and its depository institution subsidiaries are “core” banks the only approach available to “core” banks is the advanced internal ratings based “airb” approach for credit risk and the advanced measurement approach “ama” for operational risk the new guidelines provide for transitional periods during which banks subject to the new guidelines calculate their capital requirements under both the old guidelines and the new guidelines with the minimum capital requirements being the greater of required capital as calculated under the new guidelines and designated percentages of required capital as calculated under the old guidelines under the guidelines as finally adopted 2008 was the first possible year for a bank to begin its parallel run and 2009 is the first possible year for a bank to begin its first of three transitional floor periods 

in the us we are currently working towards implementing the basel iibased airb and ama approaches required by the new guidelines within the required deadlines beginning jan 1 2008 we implemented the basel ii standardized approach in the united kingdom belgium and luxembourg we 

maintain an active dialogue with us and international regulatory jurisdictions to facilitate a smooth basel ii reporting process 

we believe basel ii will not constrain our current business practices and that using the advanced approaches in the us given our portfolio could result in a reduction of riskweighted assets notwithstanding the leverage ratio requirement 

the federal reserve board requires bank holding companies to comply with minimum leverage ratio guidelines the leverage ratio is the ratio of a bank holding company’s tier i capital to its total consolidated quarterly average assets as defined for regulatory purposes net of the loan loss reserve goodwill and certain other intangible assets the guidelines require a minimum leverage ratio of 3 for bank holding companies that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the federal reserve board’s riskadjusted measure for market risk all other bank holding companies are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 4 the federal reserve board has not advised us of any specific minimum leverage ratio applicable to us at dec 31 2008 our leverage ratio was 69 

the federal reserve board’s capital guidelines provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets also the guidelines indicate that the federal reserve board will consider a “tangible tier i leverage ratio” in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities the tangible tier i leverage ratio is the ratio of a banking organization’s tier i capital excluding intangibles to total assets excluding intangibles 

prompt corrective action 

the fdi act as amended by the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 “fdicia” requires the federal banking agencies to take “prompt correction action” in respect of depository institutions that do not meet specified capital requirements fdicia establishes five capital categories for fdicinsured banks wellcapitalized adequatelycapitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized a depository institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if the banking institution has a total riskbased capital ratio of 100 or greater a

tier i riskbased capital ratio of 60 or greater and a leverage ratio of 50 or greater and the institution is not subject to an order written agreement capital directive or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific level for any capital measure the fdi act imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations management and capital distributions depending on the capital category in which an institution is classified 

at dec 31 2008 all of our bank subsidiaries were well capitalized based on the ratios and guidelines noted above a bank’s capital category however is determined solely for the purpose of applying the prompt corrective action rules and may not be an accurate representation of the bank’s overall financial condition or prospects 

the appropriate federal banking agency may under certain circumstances reclassify a well capitalized insured depository institution as adequately capitalized the fdi act provides that an institution may be reclassified if the appropriate federal banking agency determines after notice and opportunity for hearing that the institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition or deems the institution to be engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice 

the appropriate agency is also permitted to require an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution to comply with the supervisory provisions as if the institution were in the next lower category but not treat a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized based on supervisory information other than the capital levels of the institution 

antimoney laundering and the usa patriot act 

a major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions in recent years has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing the usa patriot act of 2001 the “usa patriot act” substantially broadened the scope of us antimoney laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the us the us treasury department has proposed and in some cases issued a number of implementing regulations which apply various requirements of the usa patriot act to financial institutions such as the company’s bank brokerdealer and investment adviser subsidiaries and mutual funds and private 

investment companies advised or sponsored by our subsidiaries those regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies procedures and controls to detect prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers certain of those regulations impose specific due diligence requirements on financial institutions that maintain correspondent or private banking relationships with nonus financial institutions or persons failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution 

depositor preference 

under federal law depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses and employee compensation against an insured depository institution are afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution including federal funds and letters of credit in the “liquidation or other resolution” of such an institution by any receiver 

assetbacked commercial paper liquidity facility program 

in september 2008 the federal reserve announced an asset backed commercial paper “abcp” money market mutual fund “mmmf” liquidity facility program the “abcp program” 

eligible borrowers under the abcp program include all us depository institutions us bank holding companies us branches and agencies of foreign banks and brokerdealers eligible borrowers may borrow funds under the abcp program in order to fund the purchase of eligible abcp from an mmmf the mmmf must be a fund that qualifies as a money market mutual fund under rule 2a7 of the investment company act of 1940 as amended the “investment company act” abcp used for collateral in the abcp program must be rated no lower than a1 f1 or p1 us dollar denominated and from a us issuer the abcp program which began on sept 19 2008 was initially scheduled to run through jan 30 2009 the federal reserve has extended this program through oct 30 2009 

borrowings under the abcp program are nonrecourse further the abcp pledged under the abcp program receives a 0 risk weight for riskbased capital purposes and is excluded from average total consolidated assets for leverage capital purposes

subsidiaries of the company purchased abcp under the abcp program from mmmfs managed by the company’s subsidiaries as well as funds managed by third parties at dec 31 2008 we held 56 billion of assets and liabilities under the abcp program the abcp program increased average assets by 23 billion in 2008 these assets are recorded on the balance sheet as other shortterm investments – us governmentbacked commercial paper the liabilities are recorded as borrowings from federal reserve related to assetbacked commercial paper in january 2009 45 billion of these assets and borrowings were repaid without credit losses 

temporary guarantee program for money market mutual funds 

in september 2008 the us treasury department opened its temporary guarantee program for money market mutual funds the “temporary guarantee program” the us treasury will guarantee the share price of any publicly offered eligible money market fund that applies for and pays a fee to participate in the temporary guarantee program all money market funds that are structured within the confines of rule 2a7 of the investment company act maintain a stable share price of 100 are publicly offered and are registered with the sec are eligible to participate in the temporary guarantee program 

the temporary guarantee program provides coverage to shareholders for amounts that they held in participating money market funds at the close of business on sept 19 2008 the guarantee will be triggered if the market value of assets held in a participating fund falls below 0995 the fund’s sponsor chooses not to maintain the 100 share price and the fund’s board determines to liquidate the fund the temporary guarantee program is designed to address temporary dislocations in credit markets and initially was scheduled to run through dec 18 2008 in november 2008 the department of the treasury announced an extension of the temporary guarantee program until april 30 2009 to support ongoing stability in this market continued protection is contingent upon funds renewing their coverage and paying any additional required fee the secretary of the treasury may further extend the program until sept 18 2009 however no decision has been made to extend the program beyond april 30 2009 

each dreyfus and bny mellon funds trust money market fund has entered into a guarantee agreement 

with the department of the treasury which permits these funds to participate in the temporary guarantee program on dec 12 2008 the funds renewed their coverage via the extension discussed above to ensure continued protection

community reinvestment act 

the community reinvestment act of 1977 requires banks to help serve the credit needs of their communities including credit to low and moderate income individuals and geographies should the company or its bank subsidiaries fail to adequately serve these communities potential penalties could be imposed including regulatory denials to expand branches relocate add subsidiaries and affiliates expand into new financial activities and merge with or purchase other financial institutions 

legislative initiatives

acquisitions 

federal and state laws impose approval requirements for mergers and acquisitions involving depository institutions or bank holding companies the bhc act requires the prior approval of the federal reserve board for the direct or indirect acquisition of 

more than 50 of any class of the voting shares or all or substantially all of the assets of a commercial bank savings and loan association or bank holding company in reviewing bank acquisition and merger applications the bank regulatory authorities will consider among other things the competitive effect of the transaction financial and managerial issues including the capital position of the combined organization convenience and needs factors including the applicant’s record under the community reinvestment act and the effectiveness of the subject organizations in combating money laundering activities in addition other acquisitions by the company may be subject to informal approval by the federal reserve board or other regulatory authorities 

competition 

the company is subject to intense competition in all aspects and areas of our business our asset management and wealth management business segments experience competition from asset management firms hedge funds investment banking companies bank and financial holding companies banks including trust banks brokerage firms and insurance companies these firmscompanies can be domiciled domestically or internationally our asset servicing clearing and treasury services business segments compete with domestic and foreign banks offering institutional trust and custody products and cash management products and a wide range of technologically capable service providers such as data processing and shareholder service firms and other firms that rely on automated data transfer and capture services for institutional and retail customers 

many of our competitors with the particular exception of bank and financial holding companies and banks are not subject to regulation as extensive as that described under the “supervision and regulation” section and as a result may have a competitive advantage over us and our subsidiaries in certain respects 

as a result of current conditions in the global financial markets and the economy in general competition could intensify and consolidation of financial service companies could increase 

as part of our business strategy we seek to distinguish ourselves from competitors by the level of service we deliver to clients we also believe that technological innovation is an important competitive

 item 1a risk factors 

making or continuing an investment in securities issued by us including our common stock involves certain risks that you should carefully consider the following discussion sets forth some of the more important risk factors that could affect our business financial condition or results of operations however other factors besides those discussed below or elsewhere in this or other of our reports filed with or furnished to the sec also could adversely affect our business or results we cannot assure you that the risk factors described below or elsewhere in this document are a complete set of all potential risks that we may face these risk factors also serve to describe factors which may cause our results to differ materially from those described in forwardlooking statements included herein or in other documents or statements that make reference to this report see “forwardlooking statements”

current difficult conditions in the global financial markets and the economy generally may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and the economy generally both in the us and elsewhere around the world the stress experienced by global financial markets that began in the second half of 2007 continued and substantially increased during the second half of 2008 and beginning of 2009 the volatility and disruption in the global financial markets have reached unprecedented levels the availability and cost of credit has been materially affected these factors combined with volatile oil prices depressed home prices and increasing foreclosures falling equity market values rising unemployment declining business and consumer confidence and the risk of increased inflation have precipitated what may be a severe recession the resulting economic pressure on consumers and lack of confidence in the financial markets may adversely affect certain portions of our business and our financial condition and results of operations we do not expect that the difficult conditions in the financial markets are likely to improve in the near future a worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on us and others in the financial institutions industry in particular we may face the following risks in connection with these events 

 

   

funds or by investors in other funds managed by us which are invested in those commingled investment funds may be adversely affected by depressed marktomarket prices of the underlying portfolio securities held by such funds or by material defaults on such securities or by the limited sources of liquidity that are available to such funds and we may be faced with claims from investors and exposed to financial loss as a result of our operation of such funds 

     we may experience further writedowns of our financial instruments and other losses related to volatile and illiquid market conditions  

market volatility illiquid market conditions and disruptions in the credit markets have made it extremely difficult to value certain of our securities subsequent valuations in light of factors then prevailing may result in significant changes in the values of these securities in future periods in addition at the time of any sales and settlements of 

  

16 the bank of new york mellon corporation 

part i continued 

 

 

these securities the price we ultimately realize will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their current fair value any of these factors could require us to take further writedowns in the value of our securities portfolio which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations in future periods 

competition—we are subject to intense competition in all aspects of our business which could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability 

many businesses in which we operate are intensely competitive around the world other domestic and international banks and financial service companies such as trading firms broker dealers investment banks specialized processing companies outsourcing companies data processing companies and asset managers aggressively compete with us for feebased business we also face competition from both unregulated and regulated financial services organizations such as mutual funds insurance companies credit unions money market funds and investment counseling firms whose products and services span the local national and global markets in which we conduct operations in addition insurance companies investment counseling firms brokerage houses and other business firms and individuals offer active competition for personal trust services and investment counseling services 

dependence on feebased business—we are dependent on feebased business for a substantial majority of our revenue and our feebased revenues could be adversely affected by a slowing in capital market activity significant declines in market values or negative trends in savings rates or in individual investment preferences 

our principal operational focus is on feebased business as distinct from commercial banking institutions that earn most of their revenues from traditional interestgenerating products and services we have redeployed our assets away from traditional retail banking to concentrate our resources further on feebased businesses including cash management custody mutual fund services unit investment trusts corporate trust depositary receipts stock transfer securities execution and clearance collateral management and asset management 

fees for many of our products and services are based on the volume of transactions processed the market 

value of assets managed and administered securities lending volume and spreads and fees for other services rendered corporate actions crossborder investing global mergers and acquisitions activity new debt and equity issuances and secondary trading volumes all affect the level of our revenues 

assetbased fees are typically determined on a sliding scale so that as the value of a client portfolio grows we receive a smaller percentage of the increasing value as fee income this is particularly important to our asset management global funds services and global custody businesses significant declines in the values of capital assets would reduce the market value of some of the assets that we manage and administer and result in a corresponding decrease in the amount of fees we receive and therefore would have an adverse effect on our results of operations similarly significant declines in the volume of capital markets activity would reduce the number of transactions we process and the amount of securities lending we do and therefore would also have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

pricing pressures as a result of the ability of competitors to offer comparable or improved products or services at a lower price and customer pricing reviews may result in a reduction in the price we can charge for our products and services which would likely negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability 

our business generally benefits when individuals invest their savings in mutual funds and other collective funds in defined benefit plans unit investment trusts or exchange traded funds if there is a decline in the savings rates of individuals or if there is a change in investment preferences that leads to less investment in mutual funds other collective funds and defined contribution plans our revenues could be adversely affected 

our feebased revenues could be adversely affected by a stable exchangerate environment or decreased crossborder investing activity 

the degree of volatility in foreign exchange rates can affect the amount of our foreign exchange trading revenue most of our foreign exchange revenue is derived from our securities servicing client base activity levels and spreads are generally higher when there is more volatility accordingly we benefit from currency volatility and our foreign exchange 

  

the bank of new york mellon corporation 17 

part i continued 

 

 

revenue is likely to decrease during times of decreased currency volatility 

our future revenue may increase or decrease depending upon the extent of increases or decreases in crossborder or other investments made by our clients economic and political uncertainties resulting from terrorist attacks military actions or other events including changes in laws or regulations governing crossborder transactions such as currency controls could result in decreased crossborder investment activity decreased crossborder investing could lead to decreased demand for investor services that we provide 

the trend towards use of electronic trade networks instead of traditional modes of exchange may result in unfavorable pressure on our foreign exchange business which could adversely impact our foreign exchange revenue 

our ability to retain existing business and obtain new business is dependent on our consistent execution of the feebased services we perform 

we provide custody accounting daily pricing and administration master trust and master custody investment management trustee and recordkeeping foreign exchange securities lending securities execution and clearance correspondent clearing stock transfer cash management trading and information services to clients worldwide assets under custody and assets under management are held by us in a custodial or fiduciary capacity and are not included in our assets if we fail to perform these services in a manner consistent with our fiduciary custodial and other obligations existing and potential clients may lose confidence in our ability to properly perform these services and our business may be adversely affected in addition any such failure may result in contingent liabilities that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or losses that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

our internal strategies and forecasts assume a growing client base and increasing client usage of our services a decline in the pace at which we attract new clients and a decline of the pace at which existing and new clients use additional services and assign additional assets to us for management or custody would adversely affect our future results of operations a decline in the rate at which our clients outsource functions such as their internal accounts 

payable activities would also adversely affect our results of operations 

strategic acquisitions may pose integration risks 

from time to time to achieve our strategic objectives we have acquired or invested in other companies or businesses and may do so in the future each of these poses integration challenges including successfully retaining clients and key employees of both businesses and capitalizing on certain revenue synergies we cannot assure you that we will realize when anticipated or at all the positive benefits expected as a result of our acquisitions or that any businesses acquired will be successfully integrated 

there can be no assurance that recently enacted legislation will help stabilize the us financial system 

in october 2008 the us government announced the passage of the eesa and in february 2009 enacted the arra in response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets and going concern threats to investment banks and other financial institutions 

pursuant to the eesa the us treasury has the authority to among other things invest in financial institutions purchase mortgages mortgagebacked securities and certain other financial instruments from financial institutions in an amount up to 700 billion for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets under arra further stabilization measures were made there can be no assurance however as to the actual impact that the eesa and arra will have on the financial markets including the extreme levels of volatility and limited credit availability currently being experienced the failure of the eesa and arra to help stabilize the financial markets and a continuation or worsening of current financial market conditions could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations access to credit or the trading price of our common stock 

the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us 

our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships we have exposure to many different 

  

18 the bank of new york mellon corporation 

part i continued 

 

 

industries and counterparties and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients as a result defaults by or even rumors or questions about one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally have led to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparties or clients in addition our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us there is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations or that the eesa or arra will stabilize current market conditions 

current levels of market volatility are unprecedented 

the capital and credit markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption for more than 12 months in recent months the volatility and disruption has reached unprecedented levels in some cases the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers’ underlying financial strength under these extreme conditions hedging and other risk management strategies may not be as effective at mitigating trading losses as they would be under more normal market conditions moreover under these conditions market participants are particularly exposed to trading strategies employed by many market participants simultaneously and on a large scale such as crowded trades our risk management and monitoring processes seek to quantify and mitigate risk to more extreme market moves severe market events have historically been difficult to predict however and we could realize significant losses if unprecedented extreme market events were to continue such as the recent conditions in the global financial markets and global economy 

if current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen there can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse effect which may be material on our ability to access capital and on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

any material reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets 

our longterm debt is currently rated investment grade by the major rating agencies these rating agencies regularly evaluate us and their ratings of our longterm debt are based on a number of factors including our financial strength as well as factors not entirely within our control including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally 

in addition rating agencies may employ different models and formulas to assess the financial strength of a rated company and from time to time rating agencies have in their discretion altered these models changes to the models general economic conditions or other circumstances outside our control could impact a rating agency’s judgment of its rating and the rating it assigns us in view of the difficulties experienced recently by many financial institutions we believe that the rating agencies may heighten the level of scrutiny that they apply to such institutions may increase the frequency and scope of their credit reviews may request additional information from the companies that they rate and may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels 

the outcome of such a review may have adverse ratings consequences which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding and increase our cost of capital we cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take or what actions we may be required to take in response to the actions of rating agencies which may adversely affect us 

interest rate environment—our revenues and profits are sensitive to changes in interest rates 

our net interest income and cash flows are sensitive to interest rate changes changes in valuations in the debt or equity markets and changes in customer credit quality over which we have no control our net interest revenue is the difference between the interest income earned on our interestearning assets such as the loans we make and the securities we hold in our investment portfolio and the interest expense incurred on our interestbearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed money we also earn net interest revenue on interestfree funds we hold 

  

the bank of new york mellon corporation 19 

part i continued 

 

 

  

the current global market crisis has triggered a series of cuts in interest rates which could cause a decline in our net interest revenue further declines could cause net income losses additional volatility in interest rates could trigger one or more of the following effects 

 

       a more detailed discussion of the interest rate and market risks we face is contained in the “risk management” section of the annual report 

capital adequacy—we are subject to capital adequacy guidelines and if we fail to meet these guidelines our financial condition would be adversely affected 

under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines and other regulatory requirements our company and our subsidiary banks and brokerdealers must meet guidelines that include quantitative measures of assets liabilities and certain offbalance sheet items subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components risk weightings and other factors from time to time the regulators implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy guidelines if our company our subsidiary banks or brokerdealers failed to meet these minimum capital guidelines and other regulatory requirements their respective financial conditions would be materially and 

adversely affected in light of recent market events the regulatory accords on international banking institutions formulated by the basel committee on banking supervision and implemented by the federal reserve may require us and our subsidiary banks to satisfy additional more stringent capital adequacy standards we cannot fully predict the final form of or the effects of the regulatory accords or implementing regulations failure by our principal subsidiary banks and brokerdealer subsidiaries to maintain their status as “well capitalized” and “well managed” if unremedied over a period of time would cause us to lose our status as a financial holding company and could affect the confidence of clients in us thus also compromising our competitive position financial holding companies are permitted to engage in a wide range of financial activities insurance merchant banking and real estate investment that are not permissible for other bank holding companies and are also eligible for a streamlined review process for proposed acquisitions see “supervision and regulation” above and “capital  capital framework” and “ capital adequacy” in the annual report which portions of the annual report are incorporated herein by reference 

access to capital markets—if our ability to access the capital markets is diminished our business may be adversely affected 

our business is dependent in part on our ability to access successfully the capital markets on a regular basis while the fdic’s temporary liquidity guarantee program has temporarily improved its participants’ access to sources of liquidity this program expires on june 30 2009 but may be extended we rely on access to both shortterm money markets and longterm capital markets as significant sources of liquidity to the extent liquidity requirements are not satisfied by the cash flow from our consolidated operations events or circumstances such as rising interest rates market disruptions or loss of confidence of debt purchasers or counterparties in us or in the funds markets could limit our access to capital markets increase our cost of borrowing adversely affect our liquidity or impair our ability to execute our business plan in addition our ability to raise funding could be impaired if lenders develop a negative perception of our longterm or shortterm financial prospects such negative perceptions could be developed if we incur large trading losses we are downgraded or put on or remain on negative watch by the rating agencies we

suffer a decline in the level of our business activity regulatory authorities take significant action against us or we discover significant employee misconduct or illegal activity among other reasons if we are unable to raise funding using the methods described above we would likely need to finance or liquidate unencumbered assets such as our investment and trading portfolios to meet maturing liabilities we may be unable to sell some of our assets or we may have to sell assets at a discount from market value either of which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision including regulation and supervision in nonus jurisdictions 

we operate in a highly regulated environment being subject to a comprehensive statutory regulatory regime as well as oversight by governmental agencies in light of the current conditions in the global financial markets and economy congress and regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry failure to comply with laws regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies civil money penalties and reputational damage which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations although we have policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur laws regulations or policies including accounting standards and interpretations currently affecting us and our subsidiaries may change at any time regulatory authorities may also change their interpretation of these statutes and regulations therefore our business may be adversely affected by future changes in laws regulations policies or interpretations or regulatory approaches to compliance and enforcement see “supervision and regulation” above some of the governmental authorities which may assert jurisdictional regulatory authority over us are located in and operate under jurisdictions outside the united states such jurisdictions may utilize legal principles and systems that differ materially from those encountered in the united states among other things litigation in foreign jurisdictions may be decided much more quickly than in the us trials may not involve testimony of witnesses who are in the courtroom and subject to crossexamination and trials may be based solely on submission of written materials these 

factors can make issues of regulatory compliance and legal proceedings more difficult to assess 

proposals for legislation that could substantially intensify the regulation of the financial services industry are expected to be introduced in the us congress in state legislatures and around the world the agencies regulating the financial services industry also frequently adopt changes to their regulations substantial regulatory and legislative initiatives including a comprehensive overhaul of the regulatory system in the us and rules to more closely regulate credit default swaps and other derivative transactions are possible in the years ahead we are unable to predict whether any of these initiatives will succeed which form they will take or whether any additional changes to statutes or regulations including the interpretation or implementation thereof will occur in the future any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for more information regarding the regulatory environment in which we operate see “supervision and regulation” above 

monetary and other governmental policies—our business is influenced by monetary and other governmental policies 

the monetary tax and other policies of the government and its agencies including the federal reserve have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance due to the current market conditions we anticipate that monetary tax and other government policies will become more rigorous heightened regulatory scrutiny and increased sanctions changes or potential changes in domestic and international legislation and regulation as well as domestic or international regulatory investigations impose compliance legal review and response costs that may impact our profitability and may allow additional competition facilitate consolidation of competitors or attract new competitors into our businesses the cost of geographically diversifying and maintaining our facilities to comply with regulatory mandates necessarily results in additional costs various legislative initiatives are from time to time introduced in congress or relevant state legislatures we cannot determine the ultimate effect that any such potential legislation if enacted would have upon our financial condition or operations see “supervision and regulation” above

operational risk—we are exposed to operational risk as a result of providing certain services which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we are exposed to operational risk as a result of providing various feebased services including certain securities servicing global payment services private banking and asset management services operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from errors related to transaction processing breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements fraud by employees or persons outside the corporation or business interruption due to system failures or other events we regularly assess and monitor operational risk in our business and provide for disaster and business recovery planning including geographical diversification of our facilities however the occurrence of various events including unforeseeable and unpreventable events such as hurricanes or other natural disasters could still damage our physical facilities or our computer systems or software cause delay or disruptions to operational functions impair our clients vendors and counterparties and negatively impact our results of operations operational risk also includes potential legal or regulatory actions that could arise as a result of noncompliance with applicable laws and regulatory requirements which could have an adverse effect on our reputation see “risk management” in the annual report which portion of the annual report is incorporated herein by reference 

our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented 

management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures any system of controls however well designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system are met any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 

we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business any failure interruption or breach in security of these systems 

could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management general ledger deposit loan and other systems while we have policies procedures and technical safeguards designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure interruption or security breach of our information systems there can be no assurance that any such failures interruptions or security breaches will not occur or if they do occur that they will be adequately addressed the occurrence of any failures interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation result in a loss of customer business subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations see “risk management” in the annual report which portion of the annual report is incorporated herein by reference 

technology—we depend on our technology and intellectual property if third parties misappropriate our intellectual property our business may be adversely affected 

we are dependent on technology because many of our products and services involve processing large volumes of data our technology platforms must therefore provide global capabilities and scale rapid technological changes require significant and ongoing investments in technology to develop competitive new products and services or adopt new technologies technological advances which result in lower transaction costs may adversely impact our revenues in addition unsuccessful implementation of technological upgrades and new products may adversely impact our ability to service and retain customers 

developments in the securities processing industry including shortened settlement cycles and straightthroughprocessing will necessitate ongoing changes to our business and operations and will likely require additional investment in technology our financial performance depends in part on our ability to develop and market new and innovative services to adopt or develop new technologies that differentiate our products or provide cost efficiencies and to deliver these products and services to the market in a timely manner at a competitive price 

rapid technological change in the financial services industry together with competitive pressures require us to make significant and ongoing investments we

cannot provide any assurance that our technology spending will achieve gains in competitiveness or profitability and the costs we incur in product development could be substantial accordingly we could incur substantial development costs without achieving corresponding gains in profitability 

we use trademark trade secret copyright and other proprietary rights and procedures to protect our intellectual property and technology resources despite our efforts we cannot be certain that the steps we take to prevent unauthorized use of our proprietary rights are sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our technology particularly in foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states in addition we cannot be sure that courts will adequately enforce contractual arrangements we have entered into to protect our proprietary technologies if any of our proprietary information were misappropriated by or otherwise disclosed to our competitors our competitive position could be adversely affected we may incur substantial costs to defend ownership of our intellectual property or to replace misappropriated proprietary technology if a third party were to assert a claim of infringement of our proprietary rights obtained through patents or otherwise against us with respect to one or more of our methods of doing business or conducting our operations we could be required to spend significant amounts to defend such claims develop alternative methods of operations pay substantial money damages or obtain a license from the third party 

acts of terrorism—acts of terrorism may have a negative impact on our business 

acts of terrorism could have a significant impact on our business and operations while we have in place business continuity and disaster recovery plans acts of terrorism could still damage our facilities and disrupt or delay normal operations and have a similar impact on our clients suppliers and counterparties acts of terrorism and global conflicts could also negatively impact the purchase of our products and services to the extent they resulted in reduced capital markets activity lower asset price levels or disruptions in general economic activity in the united states or abroad or in financial market settlement functions the wars in iraq and afghanistan global conflicts the national and global efforts to combat terrorism and other potential military activities and outbreaks of hostilities have affected and may further 

adversely affect economic growth and may have other adverse effects on us in ways that we are necessarily unable to predict 

reputational and legal risk—our business may be negatively affected by adverse publicity regulatory actions or litigation with respect to us other wellknown companies and the financial services industry generally 

adverse publicity and damage to our reputation arising from the recent events in the financial markets our failure or perceived failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements actions of errant employees financial reporting irregularities involving ourselves or other large and well known companies increasing regulatory scrutiny of “know your customer” antimoney laundering and antiterrorist procedures and their effectiveness regulatory investigations of the mutual fund industry including mutual funds advised by us and litigation that arises from the failure or perceived failure of us to comply with compliance policies and procedures could result in increased regulatory supervision affect our ability to attract and retain customers or maintain access to the capital markets result in suits enforcement actions fines and penalties or have adverse effects on us in ways that are not predictable investigations by various federal and state regulatory agencies the department of justice and state attorneys general and any related litigation could have an adverse effect on investment activity generally and on us such investigations also may be initiated by and other compliance requirements may be asserted by jurisdictions outside the united states utilizing legal principles and systems that differ materially from those encountered in the united states see item 3 of this form 10k 

on april 21 2006 the bank of new york now known as the bank of new york mellon entered into a formal written agreement with the federal reserve bank of new york and the new york state banking department which imposed a number of reporting requirements and controls in connection with the bank of new york mellon’s antimoney laundering program the agreement outlines a series of steps to strengthen and enhance the bank of new york mellon’s compliance practices systems controls and procedures and remains in effect until terminated by the banking regulators failure to comply with the agreement could result in sanctions money penalties and reputational damage which

on aug 17 2006 mellon bank na now known as bny mellon na entered into a settlement agreement with the united states attorney for the western district of pennsylvania relating to an april 2001 incident in bny mellon na’s pittsburgh irs processing unit under the terms of the settlement bny mellon na agreed to have an independent third party monitor compliance with the terms of the agreement for a threeyear period no monetary penalties or fines were imposed by the agreement although bny mellon na reimbursed the federal government for 30 thousand of costs incurred by an outside vendor if bny mellon na complies with the terms of the agreement the us attorney will not prosecute bny mellon na the agreement should not impair bny mellon na’s ability to serve as a longstanding government contractor 

our subsidiaries are subject to claims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibility 

from time to time customers of our subsidiaries may make claims and take legal action pertaining to performance of fiduciary responsibilities whether customer claims and legal action related to the subsidiary’s performance of its fiduciary responsibilities are founded or unfounded if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to the subsidiary they may result in material financial liability and materially impair the market perception of us and our products in addition in the performance of fiduciary duties or other contractual responsibilities our subsidiaries may be required to withhold applicable taxes on income distributions to foreign and domestic persons in the event such withholding was to be determined to have not been conducted in a manner supported by appropriate documentation we could be subject to liability 

new lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks 

from time to time we may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business there are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed in developing and marketing new lines of business andor new products and services we may invest significant time and resources initial 

timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business andor new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible 

we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain key people competition for the best people in most activities engaged in by us can be intense and we may not be able to hire people or to retain them 

tax laws and regulations—tax law changes or challenges to our tax positions with respect to historical transactions may adversely affect our net income effective tax rate and our overall results of operations and financial condition 

the us treasury department and internal revenue service “irs” have taken increasingly aggressive positions against certain corporate investment programs that either reduce or defer taxes such as certain types of structured transactions including leasing investments referred to as lilos in which we engaged prior to mid1999 and silos in which we engaged prior to 2004 as a result of such challenges by the irs in the third quarter of 2008 we accepted a settlement offer from the irs on these lilosilo transactions there can be no assurances that the irs will not challenge other corporate investment programs in the future see note 26 of notes to the consolidated financial statements in the annual report which note is incorporated herein by reference 

we believe we have adequate tax reserves to cover any potential tax exposures the irs may assess probabilities and outcomes are reviewed as events unfold and adjustments to the reserves are made when necessary but the reserves may prove inadequate because we cannot necessarily accurately predict the outcome of any challenge settlement or litigation or to what extent it will negatively affect us or our business 

going forward we anticipate we will have fewer opportunities to participate in lease investing tax credit programs and similar transactions that have benefited us in the past this may adversely impact our net interest revenue and effective tax rate in addition changes in tax legislation or the

interpretation of existing tax laws worldwide could have a material impact on our net income 

accounting principles—changes in accounting standards could have a material impact on our financial statements 

from time to time the financial accounting standards board the sec and bank regulators change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of our financial statements these changes are very difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations and other financial data although in certain instances these changes may not have an economic impact on our business in some cases we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in our restating prior period financial statements 

credit reserves—we could incur income statement charges if our reserves for credit losses including loan reserves are inadequate 

we have credit exposure to residential mortgages florida real estate the airline automotive and telecommunications industries to monoline financial guaranty insurers and to many other industries we cannot provide any assurance as to whether chargeoffs related to these sectors or to different credit risks may occur in the future though credit risk is inherent in lending activities our revenues and profitability are adversely affected when our borrowers default in whole or in part on their loan obligations to us we rely on our business experience to estimate future defaults which we use to create loan loss reserves against our loan portfolio in addition current market developments may increase default and delinquency rates which may impact our chargeoffs we cannot provide any assurance that these reserves based on management estimates will not be required to be augmented due to an unexpectedly high level of defaults if reserves for credit losses including loan reserves are not sufficient we would be required to record a larger loan reserve against current earnings 

holding company—we are a holding company and as a result are dependent on dividends from our subsidiaries including our subsidiary banks to meet our obligations including our obligations with respect to our debt securities and to provide funds for payment of dividends to our shareholders 

  

we are a nonoperating holding company whose principal assets and sources of income are our principal bank subsidiaries  the bank of new york mellon and bny mellon na  and our other subsidiaries we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our banks and other subsidiaries and therefore we rely primarily on dividends from these banking and other subsidiaries to meet our obligations including our obligations with respect to our debt securities and to provide funds for payment of dividends to our shareholders to the extent declared by our board of directors there are various legal limitations on the extent to which these banking and other subsidiaries can finance or otherwise supply funds to us by dividend or otherwise and certain of our affiliates although we maintain cash positions for liquidity at the holding company level if these banking subsidiaries or other of our subsidiaries were unable to supply us with cash over time we could be unable to meet our obligations including our obligations with respect to our debt securities or declare or pay dividends in respect of our capital stock see “supervision and regulation” above and “liquidity and dividends” and “capital  capital framework” in the annual report which portions are incorporated herein by reference 

because we are a holding company our rights and the rights of our creditors including the holders of our debt securities to a share of the assets of any subsidiary upon the liquidation or recapitalization of the subsidiary will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors including in the case of our banking subsidiaries their depositors except to the extent that we may ourselves be a creditor with recognized claims against the subsidiary the rights of holders of our debt securities to benefit from those distributions will also be junior to those prior claims consequently our debt securities will be effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries a holder of our debt securities should look only to our assets for payments in respect of those debt securities 

limits on common stock dividends 

holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock we are not required to do so any reduction of or the elimination of our common stock dividend in the future could adversely affect the market price of our

common stock as part of the capital issuance to the treasury referred to below we agreed that for three years or such prior time as the us treasury ceases to hold the series b securities issued by the company we will not pay any dividends on our common stock other than regular quarterly dividends of not more than 024 per share on oct 28 2008 the company issued to the us treasury 3 billion of fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock series b which pays cumulative dividends at a rate of 5 per annum until the fifth anniversary of the date of the investment and thereafter at a rate of 9 per annum the series b preferred shares rank senior to the company’s common stock and may impact the company’s ability to pay dividends on the common stock

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in the ordinary course of business the company and its subsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to a number of pending and potential legal actions including actions brought on behalf of various classes of claimants and regulatory matters claims for significant monetary damages are asserted in certain of these actions and proceedings in regulatory enforcement matters claims for disgorgement and the imposition of penalties andor other remedial sanctions are possible due to the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters the company cannot ascertain what the eventual outcome of these matters will be however on the basis of current knowledge and after consultation with legal counsel we do not believe that enforceable judgments or settlements if any arising from pending or potential legal actions or regulatory matters either individually or in the aggregate after giving effect to applicable reserves and insurance coverage will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the company although they could have a material effect on net income for a given period the company intends to defend itself vigorously against all of the claims asserted in these legal actions

the transaction involved payments of uk corporate income taxes that generated foreign tax credits over the 20012006 period the irs has indicated it intends to seek to disallow the foreign tax credits primarily on the basis the transaction lacked economic substance we are prepared to vigorously defend our position and believe the tax benefits associated with the transaction were consistent with irs published guidance existing at the time the transaction was entered into and with various federal appellate court decisions in the event the company is unsuccessful in defending its position the irs has agreed not to assess underpayment penalties on this transaction

institution may not pay any dividends if the institution is undercapitalized or if the payment of the dividend would cause the institution to become undercapitalized in addition the federal bank regulatory agencies have issued policy statements which provide that fdicinsured depository institutions and their holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of their current operating earnings

unsafe and unsound practices 

the occ has authority under the financial institutions supervisory act to prohibit national banks from engaging in any activity which in the occ’s opinion constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting their businesses the federal reserve board has similar authority with respect to bny mellon and our nonbank subsidiaries in 

addition the nysbd also has similar authority with respect to our new york chartered banks including the bank of new york 

deposit insurance 

substantially all deposits of our bank subsidiaries are insured up to applicable limits by the deposit insurance fund “dif” of the fdic and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the dif effective jan 1 2007 the fdic adopted a new riskbased insurance assessment system designed to tie what banks pay for deposit insurance more closely to the risks they pose the fdic also adopted a new base schedule of rates that the fdic can adjust up or down depending on the needs of the dif and set initial premiums for 2007 that range from 05 per 100 of domestic deposits in the lowest risk category to 43 per 100 of domestic deposits for banks in the highest risk category for 2007 our bank subsidiaries were assessed approximately 5 basis points that is one onehundredth of 1 per 100 of domestic deposits an fdic credit available to our bank subsidiaries for prior contributions offset the entire assessment for 2007 and will offset some of the assessment for 2008 and 2009 significant increases in the insurance assessments of our bank subsidiaries will increase our costs once the credit is fully utilized or otherwise disposed of 

in addition the deposit insurance fund act of 1996 authorizes the financing corporation “fico” to impose assessments on dif assessable deposits in order to service the interest on fico’s bond obligations the amount assessed on individual institutions by fico is in addition to the amount if any paid for deposit insurance under the fdic’s riskrelated assessment rate schedule fico assessment rates may be adjusted quarterly to reflect a change in assessment base the fico annual assessment rate for the fourth quarter of 2007 was 00114 per 100 of domestic deposits and remains 00114 for the first quarter of 2008 

under the fdi act insurance of deposits may be terminated by the fdic upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law regulation rule order or condition imposed by a bank’s federal regulatory agency

liability of commonly controlled institutions and related matters 

the fdi act contains a “crossguarantee” provision that could result in any insured depository institution owned by bny mellon being assessed for losses incurred by the fdic in connection with assistance provided to or the failure of any other insured depository institution owned by bny mellon also under the bhc act and federal reserve board policy we are expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of our bank subsidiaries and to commit resources to support each such bank in circumstances where such bank might not be in a financial position to support itself 

any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its bank subsidiaries are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such bank subsidiaries in the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment 

in addition under the national bank act if the capital stock of a national bank is impaired by losses or otherwise the occ is authorized to require payment of the deficiency by assessment upon the bank’s shareholders pro rata  and to the extent necessary if any such assessment is not paid by any shareholder after three months notice to sell the stock of such shareholder to make good the deficiency 

regulatory capital 

the federal reserve board and the occ have substantially similar riskbased capital and leverage ratio guidelines for banking organizations the guidelines are intended to ensure that banking organizations have adequate capital given the risk levels of their assets and offbalance sheet financial instruments 

the riskbased capital ratio is determined by classifying assets and certain offbalance sheet financial instruments into weighted categories with higher levels of capital being required for those categories perceived as representing greater risk under the capital guidelines a banking organization’s total capital is divided into tiers 

“tier i capital” consists of 1 common equity 2 qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock 3 for bank holding companies but not banks a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and 4 minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries including for bank holding companies but not banks trustpreferred securities less goodwill and certain other intangible assets not more than 25 of qualifying tier i capital may consist of cumulative perpetual preferred stock trustpreferred securities and other socalled “restricted core capital elements” “ tier ii capital” consists of hybrid capital instruments perpetual debt mandatory convertible debt securities a limited amount of subordinated debt preferred stock that does not qualify as tier i capital a limited amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses and a limited amount of unrealized gains on equity securities “ tier iii capital” consists of qualifying unsecured subordinated debt the sum of tier ii and tier iii capital may not exceed the amount of tier i capital 

the riskbased capital guidelines include capital charges for equity investments in nonfinancial companies the guidelines require a series of marginal capital charges on covered equity investments that increase with the level of those investments as a percentage of tier i capital with certain exceptions including investments grandfathered under the guidelines the guidelines require that bny mellon and its bank subsidiaries deduct from tier i capital the appropriate percentage set out below 

 

 the riskbased capital requirements identify concentration of credit risk and certain risks arising from nontraditional activities and the management of those risks as important factors to consider in assessing an institution’s overall capital adequacy in addition the riskbased capital guidelines incorporate a measure for market risk in foreign exchange and commodity activities and in the trading of debt and equity instruments the market riskbased capital guidelines require banking organizations with large trading activities to maintain capital for market risk in an amount 

  

the bank of new york mellon 7 

part i continued 

 

 

  

calculated by using the banking organizations’ own internal valueatrisk models subject to parameters set by the regulators 

under the riskbased capital guidelines applicable to bny mellon and its domestic bank subsidiaries the required minimum ratio of “total capital” the sum of tier i tier ii and tier iii capital to riskadjusted assets including certain offbalance sheet items such as standby letters of credit is currently 8 the required minimum ratio of tier i capital to riskadjusted assets is 4 at dec 31 2007 bny mellon’s total capital and tier i capital to riskadjusted assets ratios were 1325 and 932 respectively 

the us federal bank regulatory agencies’ risk capital guidelines are based upon the 1988 capital accord of the basel committee on banking supervision the “basel committee” the basel committee issued in june 2004 and updated in november 2005 a revised framework for capital adequacy commonly known as the new accord “new accord” or “basel ii” that would set capital requirements for operational risk and refine the existing capital requirements for credit risk 

in the united states us regulators are mandating the adoption of the new accord for “core” banks the bank of new york mellon is a “core” bank the only approach available to “core” banks is the advanced internal ratings based “airb” approach for credit risk and the advanced measurement approach “ama” for operational risk the us regulatory agencies published on dec 7 2007 the us basel ii final rule in the federal register the final rule becomes effective april 1 2008 under the final rule 2008 is the first possible year for a bank to begin its parallel run and 2009 is the first possible year for a bank to begin its first of three transitional floor periods 

in the us we are currently working towards implementing basel ii airb and ama approaches within the required deadlines we began implementing the basel ii standardized approach at our foreign subsidiaries as of jan 1 2008 we maintain an active dialogue with us and international regulatory jurisdictions to facilitate a smooth basel ii implementation process 

we believe basel ii will not constrain our current business practices and that using the advanced approaches given our portfolio could result in a 

reduction of riskweighted assets notwithstanding the leverage ratio requirement 

the federal reserve board requires bank holding companies to comply with minimum leverage ratio guidelines the leverage ratio is the ratio of a bank holding company’s tier i capital to its total consolidated quarterly average assets as defined for regulatory purposes net of the loan loss reserve goodwill and certain other intangible assets the guidelines require a minimum leverage ratio of 3 for bank holding companies that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the federal reserve board’s riskadjusted measure for market risk all other bank holding companies are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 4 the federal reserve board has not advised us of any specific minimum leverage ratio applicable to us at dec 31 2007 our leverage ratio was 653 

the federal reserve board’s capital guidelines provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets also the guidelines indicate that the federal reserve board will consider a “tangible tier i leverage ratio” in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities the tangible tier i leverage ratio is the ratio of a banking organization’s tier i capital excluding intangibles to total assets excluding intangibles 

prompt corrective action 

the fdi act requires federal banking regulators to take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements the fdi act identifies the following capital tiers for financial institutions well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 

rules adopted by the federal banking agencies provide that an institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if the banking institution has a total riskbased capital ratio of 100 or greater a tier i riskbased capital ratio of 60 or greater and a leverage ratio of 50 or greater and the institution is not subject to an order written agreement capital directive or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific level for any capital measure “adequately capitalized” if the institution 

  

8 the bank of new york mellon 

part i continued 

 

 

  

has a total riskbased capital ratio of 80 or greater a tier i riskbased capital ratio of 40 or greater and a leverage ratio of 40 or greater or a leverage ratio of 30 or greater if the institution is rated composite 1 in its most recent report of examination subject to appropriate federal banking agency guidelines and the institution does not meet the definition of a well capitalized institution “undercapitalized” if the institution has a total riskbased capital ratio that is less than 80 a tier i riskbased capital ratio that is less than 40 or a leverage ratio that is less than 40 or a leverage ratio that is less than 30 if the institution is rated composite 1 in its most recent report of examination subject to appropriate federal banking agency guidelines and the institution does not meet the definition of a significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized institution “significantly undercapitalized” if the institution has a total riskbased capital ratio that is less than 60 a tier i riskbased capital ratio that is less than 30 or a leverage ratio that is less than 30 and the institution does not meet the definition of a critically undercapitalized institution and “critically undercapitalized” if the institution has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 20 the fdi act imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations management and capital distributions depending on the capital category in which an institution is classified 

at dec 31 2007 all of our bank subsidiaries were well capitalized based on the ratios and guidelines noted above a bank’s capital category however is determined solely for the purpose of applying the prompt corrective action rules and may not constitute an accurate representation of the bank’s overall financial condition or prospects 

the appropriate federal banking agency may under certain circumstances reclassify a well capitalized insured depository institution as adequately capitalized the fdi act provides that an institution may be reclassified if the appropriate federal banking agency determines after notice and opportunity for hearing that the institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition or deems the institution to be engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice 

the appropriate agency is also permitted to require an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution to comply with the supervisory provisions as if the institution were in the next lower category 

but not treat a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized based on supervisory information other than the capital levels of the institution 

antimoney laundering and the usa patriot act 

a major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions in recent years has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing the usa patriot act of 2001 the “usa patriot act” substantially broadened the scope of us antimoney laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the us the us treasury department has proposed and in some cases issued a number of implementing regulations which apply various requirements of the usa patriot act to financial institutions such as bny mellon’s bank brokerdealer and investment adviser subsidiaries and mutual funds and private investment companies advised or sponsored by our subsidiaries those regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies procedures and controls to detect prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers certain of those regulations impose specific due diligence requirements on financial institutions that maintain correspondent or private banking relationships with nonus financial institutions or persons failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution 

depositor preference statute 

under federal law depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses and employee compensation against an insured depository institution would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution including federal funds and letters of credit in the “liquidation or other resolution” of such an institution by any receiver

privacy 

the privacy provisions of the grammleachbliley act generally prohibit financial institutions including bny mellon from disclosing nonpublic personal financial information of consumer customers to third parties for certain purposes primarily marketing unless customers have the opportunity to “opt out” of the disclosure the fair credit reporting act restricts information sharing among affiliates for marketing purposes 

community reinvestment act 

the community reinvestment act requires banks to help serve the credit needs of their communities including credit to low and moderate income individuals and geographies should bny mellon or its bank subsidiaries fail to adequately serve these communities potential penalties could be imposed including regulatory denials to expand branches relocate add subsidiaries and affiliates expand into new financial activities and merge with or purchase other financial institutions 

legislative initiatives 

various legislative initiatives are from time to time introduced in congress we cannot determine the ultimate effect that any such potential legislation if enacted would have upon our financial condition or operations 

acquisitions 

federal and state laws impose approval requirements for mergers and acquisitions involving depository institutions or bank holding companies the bhc act requires the prior approval of the federal reserve board for the direct or indirect acquisition of more than 50 of any class of the voting shares or all or substantially all of the assets of a commercial bank savings and loan association or bank holding company in reviewing bank acquisition and merger applications the bank regulatory authorities will consider among other things the competitive effect of the transaction financial and managerial issues including the capital position of the combined organization convenience and needs factors including the applicant’s record under the community reinvestment act and the effectiveness of the subject organizations in combating money laundering activities in addition other acquisitions by bny mellon may be subject to 

  

informal approval by the federal reserve bank of new york or other regulatory authority 

competition 

the bank of new york mellon and its subsidiaries are subject to intense competition in all aspects and areas of our business our asset management and wealth management business segments experience competition from asset management firms hedge funds investment banking companies bank and financial holding companies banks including trust banks brokerage firms and insurance companies these firmscompanies can be domiciled domestically or internationally our asset servicing clearing and execution and treasury services business segments compete with domestic and foreign banks offering institutional trust and custody products and cash management products and a wide range of technologically capable service providers such as data processing and shareholder service firms and other firms that rely on automated data transfer and capture services for institutional and retail customers 

many of our competitors with the particular exception of bank and financial holding companies and banks are not subject to regulation as extensive as that described under the “supervision and regulation” section and as a result may have a competitive advantage over the bank of new york mellon and its subsidiaries in certain respects 

as part of our business strategy we seek to distinguish ourselves from competitors by the level of service we deliver to clients we also believe that technological innovation is an important competitive factor and for this reason have made and continue to make substantial investments in this area the ability to recover quickly from unexpected events is a competitive factor and we have devoted significant resources to this see item 1a “risk factors – competition” below which is incorporated into this item by reference

 item 1a risk factors 

making or continuing an investment in securities issued by us including our common stock involves certain risks that you should carefully consider the following discussion sets forth some of the more important risk factors that could affect our business financial condition or results of operations however other factors besides those discussed below or elsewhere in this or other of our reports filed or furnished with the sec also could adversely affect our business or results we cannot assure you that the risk factors described below or elsewhere in this document are a complete set of all potential risks that we may face these risk factors also serve to describe factors which may cause our results to differ materially from those described in forwardlooking statements included herein or in other documents or statements that make reference to this report see “forwardlooking statements” 

business combination risks 

we may not realize the expected financial benefits from the merger between the bank of new york co and mellon 

we conduct the combined businesses previously conducted by the bank of new york co and mellon these businesses were combined in a merger which was consummated on july 1 2007 achieving the expected benefits of the combination of these businesses will require us to retain clients of both of the predecessor businesses retain key employees of both of the predecessor businesses and capitalize upon certain revenue synergies failure to accomplish these goals could adversely affect our business in addition the success of the combination of these businesses will depend in part

on our ability to realize certain cost savings if we are not able to do so the anticipated benefits of the transaction may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected it is possible that the processes of integration of the predecessor businesses could result in the loss of key employees the disruption of the predecessor businesses or inconsistencies in technologies standards controls procedures and policies any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients and employees or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the business combination and could reduce our earnings the integration of the predecessor businesses will require a significant commitment of time and resources by our management and other personnel which could divert the attention of management from other tasks 

we may not realize the expected financial benefits from the acquisition of the corporate trust business of jp morgan chase  co  the “acquired corporate trust business” 

we purchased the acquired corporate trust business on october 1 2006 achieving the expected benefits of this acquisition will require us to retain a substantial portion of the acquired corporate trust business’s client base increase the revenue growth rate of the acquired corporate trust business retain key employees of the acquired corporate trust business and realize certain anticipated cost savings if we are unable to integrate the acquired corporate trust business successfully then we may fail to realize the anticipated synergies and growth opportunities or achieve the cost savings and revenue growth we expect from the acquisition 

other acquisitions also pose integration risks 

from time to time to achieve our strategic objectives we have acquired or invested in other companies or businesses and may do so in the future each of these poses integration challenges similar to those described above we cannot assure you that we will realize when anticipated or at all the positive benefits expected as a result of our acquisitions or that any businesses acquired will be successfully integrated

our businesses benefit from certain global trends such as the growth of financial assets creation of new securities financial services industry consolidation rapid technological change globalization of investment activities structural changes to financial markets including consolidation shortened settlement cycles straightthrough processing requirements and increased demand for outsourcing we believe that these longterm trends all tend to increase the demand for our products and services around the world if these trends do not continue we may lose customers or lose revenue associated with products that may no longer be in demand which may adversely affect our revenue growth 

we expect that our businesses will benefit from worldwide pension reform that creates additional pools of assets that use custody and related services and investment management services if the pace of pension reform and resulting programs including growth of public and private pension plans slows down or if substantial pension reform does not occur particularly in markets in which we are active then our revenue growth may be adversely affected 

in addition unexpected sustained weakness in business and economic conditions in any or all of the domestic or international financial markets in which we conduct our business could have one or more of the following effects

  competition—we are subject to intense competition in all aspects of our business which could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability 

many businesses in which we operate are intensely competitive around the world other domestic and international banks and financial service companies such as trading firms broker dealers investment banks specialized processing companies outsourcing companies data processing companies and asset managers aggressively compete with us for feebased business we also face competition from both unregulated and regulated financial services organizations such as mutual funds insurance companies credit unions money market funds and investment counseling firms whose products and services span the local national and global markets in which we conduct operations in addition insurance companies investment counseling firms brokerage houses and other business firms and individuals offer active competition for personal trust services and investment counseling services 

pricing pressures as a result of the ability of competitors to offer comparable or improved products or services at a lower price and customer pricing reviews may result in a reduction in the price we can charge for our products and services which would likely negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability 

our internal strategies and forecasts assume a growing client base and increasing client usage of our services a decline in the pace at which we attract new clients and a decline of the pace at which existing and new clients use additional services and assign additional assets to us for management or custody would adversely affect our future results of operations a decline in the rate at which our clients outsource functions such as their internal accounting activities would also adversely affect our results of operations 

  

our ability to successfully compete for business depends in part on our ability to develop and market new and innovative services and to adopt or develop new technologies that differentiate our products or provide cost efficiencies rapid technological change in the financial services industry together with competitive pressures require us to make significant and ongoing investments to bring new services to market in a timely fashion at competitive prices we cannot provide any assurance that our technology spending will achieve gains in competitiveness or profitability and the costs we incur in product development could be substantial accordingly we could incur substantial development costs without achieving corresponding gains in profitability 

dependence on feebased business—we are dependent on feebased business for a substantial majority of our revenue and our feebased revenues could be adversely affected by a slowing in capital market activity significant declines in market values or negative trends in savings rates or in individual investment preferences 

our principal operational focus is on feebased business as distinct from commercial banking institutions that earn most of their revenues from traditional interestgenerating products and services we have redeployed our assets away from traditional retail banking to concentrate our resources further on feebased businesses including cash management custody mutual fund services unit investment trusts corporate trust depositary receipts stock transfer securities execution and clearance collateral management and asset management 

fees for many of our products and services are based on the volume of transactions processed the market value of assets managed and administered securities lending volume and spreads and fees for other services rendered corporate actions crossborder investing global mergers and acquisitions activity new debt and equity issuances and secondary trading volumes all affect the level of our revenues 

assetbased fees are typically determined on a sliding scale so that as the value of a client portfolio grows we receive a smaller percentage of the increasing value as fee income this is particularly important to our asset management global funds services and global custody businesses significant declines in the values of capital assets would reduce

part i continued 

 

 

  

the market value of some of the assets that we manage and administer and result in a corresponding decrease in the amount of fees we receive and therefore would have an adverse effect on our results of operations similarly significant declines in the volume of capital markets activity would reduce the number of transactions we process and the amount of securities lending we do and therefore would also have an adverse effect on our results of operations our business generally benefits when individuals invest their savings in mutual funds and other collective funds in defined benefit plans unit investment trusts or exchange traded funds if there is a decline in the savings rates of individuals or if there is a change in investment preferences that leads to less investment in mutual funds other collective funds and defined contribution plans our revenues could be adversely affected 

our feebased revenues could be adversely affected by a stable exchangerate environment or decreased crossborder investing activity 

the degree of volatility in foreign exchange rates can affect the amount of our foreign exchange trading revenue most of our foreign exchange revenue is derived from our securities servicing client base activity levels and spreads are generally higher when there is more volatility accordingly we benefit from currency volatility and our foreign exchange revenue is likely to decrease during times of decreased currency volatility 

our future revenue may increase or decrease depending upon the extent of increases or decreases in crossborder or other investments made by our clients economic and political uncertainties resulting from terrorist attacks military actions or other events including changes in laws or regulations governing crossborder transactions such as currency controls could result in decreased crossborder investment activity decreased crossborder investing could lead to decreased demand for investor services that we provide 

the trend towards use of electronic trade networks instead of traditional modes of exchange may result in unfavorable pressure on our foreign exchange business which could adversely impact our foreign exchange revenue 

our ability to retain existing business and obtain new business is dependent on our consistent execution of the feebased services we perform 

we provide custody accounting daily pricing and administration master trust and master custody investment management trustee and recordkeeping foreign exchange securities lending securities execution and clearance correspondent clearing stock transfer cash management trading and information services to clients worldwide assets under custody and assets under management are held by us in a custodial or fiduciary capacity and are not included in our assets if we fail to perform these services in a manner consistent with our fiduciary custodial and other obligations existing and potential clients may lose confidence in our ability to properly perform these services and our business may be adversely affected in addition any such failure may result in contingent liabilities that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or losses that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

interest rate environment—our revenues and profits are sensitive to changes in interest rates 

our net interest income and cash flows are sensitive to interest rate changes changes in valuations in the debt or equity markets and changes in customer credit quality over which we have no control our net interest income is the difference between the interest income earned on our interestearning assets such as the loans we make and the securities we hold in our investment portfolio and the interest expense incurred on our interestbearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed money we also earn net interest income on interestfree funds we hold 

as a result of changes in interest rates we may experience one or more of the following effects

   a more detailed discussion of the interest rate and market risks we face is contained in the risk management section of the annual report 

capital adequacy—we are subject to capital adequacy guidelines and if we fail to meet these guidelines our financial condition would be adversely affected 

under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines and other regulatory requirements bny mellon and our subsidiary banks and brokerdealers must meet guidelines that include quantitative measures of assets liabilities and certain offbalance sheet items subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components risk weightings and other factors from time to time the regulators implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy guidelines if bny mellon its subsidiary banks or brokerdealers failed to meet these minimum capital guidelines and other regulatory requirements their respective financial conditions would be materially and adversely affected the regulatory accords on international banking institutions to be reached by the basel committee on banking supervision and implemented by the federal reserve may require us and our subsidiary banks to satisfy additional more stringent capital adequacy standards we cannot fully predict the final form of or the effects of the regulatory accords or implementing regulations failure by our principal subsidiary banks and brokerdealer subsidiaries to maintain their status as “well capitalized” and “well managed” if unremedied over a period of time would cause us to lose our status as a financial holding company and could affect the confidence of clients in us thus also compromising our competitive position financial holding companies are permitted to engage in a wide range of financial activities insurance merchant banking and real estate investment that are not permissible for other bank holding companies and are also eligible for a streamlined review process for proposed acquisitions see “supervision and regulation” above and “capital—capital framework” and “capital—capital adequacy” in the annual report which portions of the annual report are incorporated herein by reference 

  

access to capital markets—if our ability to access the capital markets is diminished our business may be adversely affected 

our business is dependent in part on our ability to access successfully the capital markets on a regular basis we rely on access to both shortterm money markets and longterm capital markets as significant sources of liquidity to the extent liquidity requirements are not satisfied by the cash flow from our consolidated operations events or circumstances such as rising interest rates market disruptions or an adverse change in our credit ratings or loss of confidence of debt purchasers or counterparties in us or in the funds markets could limit our access to capital markets increase our cost of borrowing adversely affect our liquidity or impair our ability to execute our business plan 

we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision including regulation and supervision by nonus jurisdictions 

we operate in a highly regulated environment being subject to a comprehensive statutory regulatory regime as well as oversight by governmental agencies failure to comply with laws regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies civil money penalties and reputational damage which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations although we have policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur laws regulations or policies including accounting standards and interpretations currently affecting us and our subsidiaries may change at any time regulatory authorities may also change their interpretation of these statutes and regulations therefore our business may be adversely affected by future changes in laws regulations policies or interpretations or regulatory approaches to compliance and enforcement see “supervision and regulation” above some of the governmental authorities which may assert jurisdictional regulatory authority over us are located in and operate under jurisdictions outside the united states such jurisdictions may utilize legal principles and systems that differ materially from those encountered in the united states among other things litigation in foreign jurisdictions may be

decided much more quickly than in the us trials may not involve testimony of witnesses who are in the courtroom and subject to crossexamination and trials may be based solely on submission of written materials these factors can make issues of regulatory compliance and legal proceedings more difficult to assess 

monetary and other governmental policies—our business is influenced by monetary and other governmental policies 

the monetary tax and other policies of the government and its agencies including the federal reserve have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance heightened regulatory scrutiny and increased sanctions changes or potential changes in domestic and international legislation and regulation as well as domestic or international regulatory investigations impose compliance legal review and response costs that may impact our profitability and may allow additional competition facilitate consolidation of competitors or attract new competitors into our businesses the cost of geographically diversifying and maintaining our facilities to comply with regulatory mandates necessarily results in additional costs see “supervision and regulation” above 

operational risk—we are exposed to operational risk as a result of providing certain services which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we are exposed to operational risk as a result of providing various feebased services including certain securities servicing global payment services private banking and asset management services operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from errors related to transaction processing breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements fraud by employees or persons outside the corporation or business interruption due to system failures or other events we regularly assess and monitor operational risk in our business and provide for disaster and business recovery planning including geographical diversification of our facilities however the occurrence of various events including unforeseeable and unpreventable events such as hurricanes or other natural disasters could still damage our physical facilities or our computer systems or software cause delay or disruptions to operational functions impair our clients vendors and counterparties and negatively impact our results of operations operational risk also includes potential legal or regulatory actions that could arise as a result of noncompliance with applicable laws and regulatory requirements which 

could have an adverse effect on our reputation see “risk management” in the annual report which portion of the annual report is incorporated herein by reference 

our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented 

management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures any system of controls however well designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system are met any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 

we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business any failure interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management general ledger deposit loan and other systems while we have policies procedures and technical safeguards designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure interruption or security breach of our information systems there can be no assurance that any such failures interruptions or security breaches will not occur or if they do occur that they will be adequately addressed the occurrence of any failures interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation result in a loss of customer business subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations see “risk management” in the annual report which portion of the annual report is incorporated herein by reference

technology—we depend on technology and our intellectual property if third parties misappropriate our intellectual property our business may be adversely affected 

we are dependent on technology because many of our products and services involve processing large volumes of data our technology platforms must therefore provide global capabilities and scale rapid technological changes require significant and ongoing investments in technology to develop competitive new products and services or adopt new technologies technological advances which result in lower transaction costs may adversely impact our revenues in addition unsuccessful implementation of technological upgrades and new products may adversely impact our ability to service and retain customers 

developments in the securities processing industry including shortened settlement cycles and straightthroughprocessing will necessitate ongoing changes to our business and operations and will likely require additional investment in technology our financial performance depends in part on our ability to develop and market new and innovative services to adopt or develop new technologies that differentiate our products or provide cost efficiencies and to deliver these products and services to the market at a competitive price 

we use trademark trade secret copyright and other proprietary rights and procedures to protect our intellectual property and technology resources despite our efforts we cannot be certain that the steps we take to prevent unauthorized use of our proprietary rights are sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our technology particularly in foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states in addition we cannot be sure that courts will adequately enforce contractual arrangements we have entered into to protect our proprietary technologies if any of our proprietary information were misappropriated by or otherwise disclosed to our competitors our competitive position could be adversely affected we may incur substantial costs to defend ownership of our intellectual property or to replace misappropriated proprietary technology if a third party were to assert a claim of infringement of our proprietary rights obtained through patents or otherwise against us with respect to one or more of our methods of doing business or conducting our 

operations we could be required to spend significant amounts to defend such claims develop alternative methods of operations pay substantial money damages or obtain a license from the third party 

acts of terrorism—acts of terrorism may have a negative impact on our business 

acts of terrorism could have a significant impact on our business and operations while we have in place business continuity and disaster recovery plans acts of terrorism could still damage our facilities and disrupt or delay normal operations and have a similar impact on our clients suppliers and counterparties acts of terrorism and global conflicts could also negatively impact the purchase of our products and services to the extent they resulted in reduced capital markets activity lower asset price levels or disruptions in general economic activity in the united states or abroad or in financial market settlement functions the war in iraq global conflicts the national and global efforts to combat terrorism and other potential military activities and outbreaks of hostilities have affected and may further adversely affect economic growth and may have other adverse effects on us in ways that we are necessarily unable to predict 

reputational and legal risk—our business may be negatively affected by adverse publicity regulatory actions or litigation with respect to us other wellknown companies and the financial services industry generally 

adverse publicity and damage to our reputation arising from our failure or perceived failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements actions of errant employees financial reporting irregularities involving ourselves or other large and well known companies increasing regulatory scrutiny of “know your customer” antimoney laundering and antiterrorist procedures and their effectiveness regulatory investigations of the mutual fund industry including mutual funds advised by us and litigation that arises from the failure or perceived failure of us to comply with compliance policies and procedures could result in increased regulatory supervision affect our ability to attract and retain customers or maintain access to the capital markets result in suits enforcement actions fines and penalties or have adverse effects on us in ways that are not predictable investigations by various federal and state regulatory agencies the department of justice and state attorneys general

and any related litigation could have an adverse effect on investment activity generally and on us such investigations also may be initiated by and other compliance requirements may be asserted by jurisdictions outside the united states utilizing legal principles and systems that differ materially from those encountered in the united states see item 3 of this form 10k 

on nov 7 2005 one of our principal banking subsidiaries the bank of new york entered into a nonprosecution agreement with the united states attorney’s offices for the eastern and southern districts of new york which imposed a number of remedial steps and programs in connection with the bank of new york’s antimoney laundering program the agreement outlines a series of steps to strengthen and enhance the bank of new york’s compliance practices systems controls and procedures and remains in effect for three years unless earlier terminated by the us attorney’s offices failure to comply with the agreement could result in criminal prosecution for participation in alleged fraudulent activities and money laundering activities in 2002 and previously in the case of the alleged fraudulent activities and 1999 and previously in the case of the alleged money laundering activities such prosecution could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

on april 21 2006 the bank of new york entered into a formal written agreement with the federal reserve bank of new york and the new york state banking department which imposed a number of reporting requirements and controls in connection with the bank of new york’s antimoney laundering program the agreement outlines a series of steps to strengthen and enhance the bank of new york’s compliance practices systems controls and procedures and remains in effect until terminated by the banking regulators failure to comply with the agreement could result in sanctions money penalties and reputational damage which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

on aug 17 2006 one of our principal banking subsidiaries mellon bank na “mellon bank” entered into a settlement agreement with the united states attorney for the western district of pennsylvania relating to an april 2001 incident in mellon bank’s pittsburgh irs processing unit under the terms of the settlement mellon bank 

agreed to have an independent third party monitor compliance with the terms of the agreement for a threeyear period no monetary penalties or fines were imposed by the agreement although mellon bank reimbursed the federal government for 30 thousand of costs incurred by an outside vendor if mellon bank complies with the terms of the agreement the us attorney will not prosecute mellon bank the agreement should not impair mellon bank’s ability to serve as a longstanding government contractor 

our subsidiaries are subject to claims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibility 

from time to time customers of our subsidiaries may make claims and take legal action pertaining to performance of fiduciary responsibilities whether customer claims and legal action related to the subsidiary’s performance of its fiduciary responsibilities are founded or unfounded if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to the subsidiary they may result in material financial liability and materially impair the market perception of us and our products in addition in the performance of fiduciary duties or other contractual responsibilities our subsidiaries may be required to withhold applicable taxes on income distributions to foreign and domestic persons in the event such withholding was to be determined to have not been conducted in a manner supported by appropriate documentation we could be subject to liability 

new lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks 

from time to time we may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business there are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed in developing and marketing new lines of business andor new products and services we may invest significant time and resources initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business andor new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible

we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain key people competition for the best people in most activities engaged in by us can be intense and we may not be able to hire people or to retain them the unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills knowledge of our market years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel 

tax laws and regulations—tax law changes or challenges to our tax positions with respect to historical transactions may adversely affect our net income effective tax rate and our overall results of operations and financial condition 

the us treasury department and internal revenue service “irs” have taken increasingly aggressive positions against certain corporate investment programs that either reduce or defer taxes the irs has challenged certain types of structured transactions including leasing investments referred to as lilos in which we engaged prior to mid1999 and silos in which we engaged prior to 2004 see note 24 of notes to the consolidated financial statements in the annual report which note is incorporated herein by reference 

we have also entered into investments that produce synthetic fuel from coal byproducts section 29 of the internal revenue code provides a tax credit for these types of transactions the amount of the credit is dependent on the amount of synthetic fuel produced by these investments the tax credits available under section 29 of the internal revenue code for the production and sale of synthetic fuel produced in any given year are phased out if the reference price of a barrel of oil for that year rises above a specified inflationadjusted price range 

to manage the exposure to oil prices in 2007 we entered into an oilrelated option contract in january 2007 the synthetic fuel credit program terminated at the end of 2007 see the “income taxes” section in the annual report which section is incorporated herein by reference 

we believe we have adequate tax reserves to cover the potential tax exposures the irs is likely to assess probabilities and outcomes are reviewed as 

events unfold and adjustments to the reserves are made when necessary but the reserves may prove inadequate because we cannot necessarily accurately predict the outcome of any challenge settlement or litigation or to what extent it will negatively affect us or our business 

going forward we anticipate we will have fewer opportunities to participate in lease investing tax credit programs and similar transactions that have benefited us in the past this may adversely impact our net interest income and effective tax rate in addition changes in tax legislation or the interpretation of existing tax laws worldwide could have a material impact on our net income 

accounting principles—changes in accounting standards could have a material impact on our financial statements 

from time to time the financial accounting standards board the sec and bank regulators change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of our financial statements these changes are very difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations and other financial data although in certain instances these changes may not have an economic impact on our business in some cases we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in our restating prior period financial statements 

credit reserves—we could incur income statement charges if our reserves for credit losses including loan reserves are inadequate 

we have credit exposure to the airline automotive and telecommunications industries to monoline financial guaranty insurers and to many other industries we cannot provide any assurance as to whether chargeoffs related to these sectors or to different credit risks may occur in the future though credit risk is inherent in lending activities our revenues and profitability are adversely affected when our borrowers default in whole or in part on their loan obligations to us we rely on our business experience to estimate future defaults which we use to create loan loss reserves against our loan portfolio we cannot provide any assurance that these reserves based on management estimates will not be required to be augmented due to an unexpectedly high level of defaults if reserves for

credit losses including loan reserves are not 

sufficient we would be required to record a larger loan reserve against current earnings 

holding company—we are a holding company and as a result are dependent on dividends from our subsidiaries including our subsidiary banks to meet our obligations including our obligations with respect to our debt securities and to provide funds for payment of dividends to our shareholders 

we are a nonoperating holding company whose principal assets and sources of income are our principal bank subsidiaries  the bank of new york and mellon bank na  and our other subsidiaries we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our bank and other subsidiaries and therefore we rely primarily on dividends from these banking and other subsidiaries to meet our obligations including our obligations with respect to our debt securities and to provide funds for payment of dividends to our shareholders to the extent declared by our board of directors there are various legal limitations on the extent to which these banking and other subsidiaries can finance or otherwise supply funds to us by dividend or otherwise and certain of our affiliates although we maintain cash positions for liquidity at the holding company level if these banking subsidiaries or other of our subsidiaries were unable to supply us with cash over time we could be unable to meet our obligations including our obligations with respect to our debt securities or declare or pay dividends in respect of our capital stock see “supervision and regulation” above and “liquidity and dividends” and “capital—capital framework” in the annual report which portions are incorporated herein by reference 

because we are a holding company our rights and the rights of our creditors including the holders of our debt securities to a share of the assets of any subsidiary upon the liquidation or recapitalization of the subsidiary will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors including in the case of the banking subsidiaries their depositors except to the extent that we may ourselves be a creditor with recognized claims against the subsidiary the rights of holders of our debt securities to benefit from those distributions will also be junior to those prior claims consequently our debt securities will be effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries a holder of our debt securities should look only to our assets for payments in respect of those debt securities

 item 3 legal and regulatory proceedings 

in the ordinary course of business the company and its subsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to a number of pending and potential legal actions including actions brought on behalf of various classes of claimants and regulatory matters claims for significant monetary damages are asserted in certain of these actions and proceedings in regulatory enforcement matters claims for disgorgement and the imposition of penalties andor other remedial sanctions are possible due to the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such 

matters the company cannot ascertain what the eventual outcome of these matters will be however on the basis of current knowledge and after consultation with legal counsel we do not believe that enforceable judgments or settlements if any arising from pending or potential legal actions or regulatory matters either individually or in the aggregate after giving effect to applicable reserves and insurance coverage will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the company although they could have a material effect on net income for a given period the company intends to defend itself vigorously against all of the claims asserted in these legal actions 

as previously disclosed in the company’s form 8k dated may 17 2007 the federal customs service of the russian federation is pursuing a claim against the bank of new york “bny” a subsidiary of the company the claim is based on allegations relating to the previously disclosed russian funds transfer matter that was the subject of the company’s nonprosecution agreement described in item 1a “risk factors” above and alleges violations of us law by failing to supervise and monitor funds transfer activities at bny this “lack of action” is alleged to have resulted in underpayment to the russian federation of the value added taxes that were due to be paid by the customers of the bank’s clients on certain goods imported into the country the claim seeks 225 billion in “direct and indirect” losses 

bny has been defending itself vigorously in this matter and intends to continue to do so bny believes it has meritorious procedural and substantive defenses to the allegations in the russian courts and also believes it has meritorious defenses to an attempted enforcement of a judgment outside the russian federation in countries in which bny has material assets if a judgment were to be entered in this matter by the russian courts 

in 2001 and 2002 we entered into various structured transactions that involved among other things the payment of uk corporate income taxes that were credited against our us corporate income tax liability the irs continues to review these transactions and it is likely that some or all of the

credits will be challenged upon completion of the review 

on oct 9 2007 we received a letter from the irs informing us that the irs is considering designating one such transaction for litigation at this time it is unknown if the transaction will ultimately be designated for litigation but if so designated we are prepared to defend our position and we believe that any tax benefits associated with these transactions were consistent with the applicable statutory judicial and administrative authority existing at the time they were entered into 

bny filed a proof of claim on january 18 2008 in the chapter 11 bankruptcy of sentinel management group inc “sentinel” seeking to recover approximately 312 million loaned to sentinel and secured by securities and cash in an account maintained by sentinel at bny at the time of the bankruptcy the cash and securities collateral for the loan were valued at over 600 million the chapter 11 trustee for sentinel recently indicated that he is prepared to file an adversary proceeding against bny seeking to disallow bny’s claim and asserting a claim for damages against bny under a variety of theories including that bny aided and abetted certain insiders of sentinel in misappropriating customer assets and improperly using those assets as collateral for the loan in january 2008 bny learned that the commodities futures trading commission the “cftc” opened an investigation that includes a review of sentinels relationship with bny while the timing and outcome of the bankruptcy is uncertain the company intends to vigorously pursue its claim 

as previously disclosed in the company’s annual report on form 10k for the year ended dec 31 2006 the us securities and exchange commission “sec” is investigating the trading activities of pershing trading company lp a floor specialist on two regional exchanges from 1999 to 2004 because the conduct at issue is alleged to have occurred largely during the period when pershing was owned by credit suisse first boston usa inc “csfb” the company has made claims for indemnification against csfb relating to this matter under the agreement relating to the acquisition of pershing csfb is disputing these claims for indemnification 

the company previously disclosed in its annual report on form 10k for the year ended dec 31 2006 that the sec was investigating the appropriateness of certain expenditures made in connection with marketing and distribution of the hamilton funds the company was informed by the sec staff on sept 11 2007 that they had 

  

concluded their investigation and that no enforcement action was recommended

introduction

     the business of the bank of new york company inc the company and
its subsidiaries is described in the companys 2001 annual report to
shareholders beginning under the heading global vision with a local focus
and continuing through retail banking which description is included in
exhibit 13 to this report and incorporated herein by reference  also the
managements discussion and analysis section included in exhibit 13 contains
financial and statistical information on the operations of the company  such
information is herein incorporated by reference

certain regulatory considerations

general

     as a bank holding company the company is subject to the regulation and
supervision of the federal reserve board under the bank holding company act of
1956 bhc act  the company is also subject to regulation by the new york
state banking department  under the bhc act bank holding companies may not
directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than 5 of the
voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any bank or bank holding
company without the prior approval of the federal reserve board  in
addition bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies are
generally limited to engaging in the business of banking managing or
controlling banks and other activities that the federal reserve board has
determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident
thereto

     under the grammleachbliley act the glb act which became effective
on march 11 2000 with respect to provisions relating to powers bank holding
companies each of whose depository institution subsidiaries is well
capitalized as defined under the federal deposit insurance act and well
managed as defined under regulation y under the bhc act and which obtain at
least a satisfactory rating under the community reinvestment act have the
ability to declare themselves to be financial holding companies and engage in
a broader range of activities than those traditionally permissible for us
bank holding companies  the companys declaration to become a financial
holding company became effective on august 11 2000  as a financial holding
company the company may conduct or acquire a company other than a us
depository institution or foreign bank engaged in activities that are
financial in nature as well as additional activities that the federal
reserve board determines in the case of incidental activities in conjunction
with the department of the treasury are incidental or complementary to
financial activities without the prior approval of the federal reserve board
under the glb act activities that are financial in nature include insurance
securities underwriting and dealing merchant banking and lending activities
under the new merchant banking authority added by the glb act financial
holding companies may invest in companies that engage in activities that are
not otherwise permissible subject to certain limitations including that the
financial holding company makes the investment with the intention of limiting

page 3

the investment in duration and does not manage the company on a daytoday
basis

     financial holding companies that do not continue to meet all of the
requirements for financial holding company status will depending on which
requirement they fail to meet lose the ability to undertake new activities or
acquisitions that are financial in nature or to continue those activities that
are not generally permissible for bank holding companies

     the companys subsidiary banks are subject to supervision and examination
by applicable federal and state banking agencies  the bank of new york
bny the companys principal banking subsidiary is a new york chartered
banking corporation a member of the federal reserve system and is subject to
regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve board and by
the new york state banking department

     both federal and state laws extensively regulate various aspects of the
banking business such as permissible types and amounts of loans and
investments permissible activities and reserve requirements  these
regulations are intended primarily for the protection of depositors rather
than the companys stockholders

capital adequacy

     the federal bank regulators have adopted riskbased capital guidelines
for bank holding companies and banks  the minimum ratio of qualifying total
capital total capital to riskweighted assets including certain off
balance sheet items is 8  at least half of the total capital must consist
of common stock retained earnings noncumulative perpetual preferred stock
minority interests including preferred trust securities and for bank
holding companies a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual
preferred stock less most intangibles including goodwill tier 1 capital
the remainder tier 2 capital may consist of other preferred stock certain
other instruments and limited amounts of subordinated debt and the loan and
lease allowance  not more than 25 of qualifying tier 1 capital may consist
of preferred trust securities

     in addition the federal reserve board has established minimum leverage
ratio tier 1 capital to average total assets guidelines for bank holding
companies and banks  the federal reserve boards guidelines provide for a
minimum leverage ratio of 3 for bank holding companies and banks that meet
certain specified criteria including those having the highest regulatory
rating  all other banking organizations will be required to maintain a
leverage ratio of at least 3 plus an additional cushion of 100 to 200 basis
points  the guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing
internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong
capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without
significant reliance on intangible assets  at december 31 2001 the federal
reserve board has not advised the company of any specific minimum leverage
ratio applicable to it  see fdicia below

merchant banking capital requirements

     the federal bank regulators have adopted rules effective april 1 2002
governing the regulatory capital treatment of equity investments by the
company in nonfinancial companies  such equity investments which are
referred to as merchant banking investments include investments made under
the merchant banking authority conferred on financial holding companies under
the glb act as well as pursuant to certain other authority with certain
exceptions the federal rules require that the company and its bank
subsidiaries deduct from tier 1 capital on a marginal basis a percentage of
the carrying value of each merchant banking investment  carrying value is
generally the value of the merchant banking investment as shown on the
companys balance sheet  the applicable percentages are set forth below

  aggregate carrying value of covered   required deduction from tier 1 capital
  nonfinancial equity investments as a  as a percentage of
  percentage of tier 1 capital          the carrying value of the investments
    

        less than 15                                    8
        at least 15 but less than 25                  12
        25 or more                                     25

     it is not anticipated that the new rule will have a material effect on
the companys capital requirements or strategic plans

     bank regulators on an international basis are reconsidering the current
capital guidelines one aspect of this reconsideration is the potential
imposition of capital requirements for operational risk such a capital
requirement could have a relatively greater impact on banking organizations
such as the company and the bank that have a high level of fee income but
based on current proposals the company does not believe that the requirement
would affect the qualification of the company and the bank as well
capitalized

fdicia

     the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991
fdicia among other things requires federal banking regulators to take
prompt corrective action in respect of fdicinsured depository institutions
such as bny that do not meet minimum capital requirements  fdicia
establishes five capital tiers well capitalized adequately capitalized
undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically
undercapitalized  a depository institutions capital tier will depend upon
how its capital levels compare to various relevant capital measures and
certain other factors as established by regulation  under applicable
regulations an fdicinsured bank is deemed to be i well capitalized if it
maintains a leverage ratio of at least 5 a tier 1 capital ratio of at least
6 and a total capital ratio of at least 10 and is not subject to an order
written agreement capital directive or prompt corrective action directive to
meet and maintain a specific level for any capital measure ii adequately
capitalized if it maintains a leverage ratio of at least 4 or a leverage
ratio of at least 3 if it is rated composite 1 in its most recent report of
examination subject to appropriate federal banking agency guidelines a tier
1 capital ratio of 4 and a total capital ratio of at least 8 and is not
defined to be well capitalized but meets all of its minimum capital
requirements iii undercapitalized if it has a leverage ratio of less than
4 or a leverage ratio that is less than 3 if it is rated composite 1 in its
most recent report of examination subject to appropriate federal banking
agency guidelines a tier 1 capital ratio less than 4 or a total capital
ratio of less than 8 and it does not meet the definition of a significantly
undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized institution iv
significantly undercapitalized if it has a leverage ratio of less than 3 a
tier 1 capital ratio less than 3 or a total capital ratio of less than 8 and
it does not meet the definition of critically undercapitalized and v
critically undercapitalized if it maintains a level of tangible equity capital

page 5

less than 2 of total assets  a bank may be deemed to be in a capitalization
category that is lower than is indicated by its actual capital position if it
receives an unsatisfactory examination rating  fdicia imposes progressively
more restrictive constraints on operations management and capital
distributions depending on the capital category in which an institution is
classified

     fdicia generally prohibits an fdicinsured depository institution from
making any capital distribution including payment of dividends or paying any
management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would
thereafter be undercapitalized  undercapitalized depository institutions are
subject to restrictions on borrowing from the federal reserve  in addition
undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth limitations and
are required to submit a capital restoration plan  the federal banking
agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining among other
things that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to
succeed in restoring the depository institutions capital  in addition for
an undercapitalized depository institutions capital restoration plan to be
acceptable its holding company must guarantee the capital plan up to an
amount equal to the lesser of 5 of the depository institutions assets at the
time it became undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deficiency when
the institution fails to comply with the plan  in the event of the parent
holding companys bankruptcy such guarantee would take priority over the
parents general unsecured creditors  if a depository institution fails to
submit an acceptable plan it is treated as if it is significantly
undercapitalized

     significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to
a number of requirements and restrictions including orders to sell sufficient
voting stock to become adequately capitalized requirements to reduce total
assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks
critically undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to appointment
of a receiver or conservator

     a depository institution that is not well capitalized is subject to
certain limitations on brokered deposits  in addition as indicated above if
a depository institution is not well capitalized its parent holding company
cannot become and subject to a capital restoration plan cannot remain a
financial holding company

fdic insurance assessments

     bny is subject to fdic deposit insurance assessments  as required by
fdicia the fdic adopted a riskbased premium schedule to determine the
assessment rates for most fdicinsured depository institutions  effective
january 1 1997 under the schedule the premiums range from zero to 27 for
every 100 of deposits  each financial institution is assigned to one of nine
categories based on the institutions capital ratios and supervisory
evaluations and the premium paid by the institution is based on the category
under the present schedule institutions in the highest of the three capital
categories and the highest of three supervisory categories pay no premium and
institutions in the lowest of these categories pay 27 per 100 of deposits
bny paid no fdic insurance premiums in 2001  in addition the deposit
insurance funds act provides for assessments at all insured depository
institutions to pay for the cost of the financing corporation a governmental
agency funding  the assessment will be based on deposit levels and will be
approximately 206 basis points

     the fdic is authorized to raise insurance premiums in certain
circumstances a number of factors suggest that as early as the second half of
2002 the bank deposit insurance fund could fall below its federally mandated
minimum  if this happens all fdic insured banks including bny will be
required to pay premiums on deposit insurance  the amount of any such
premiums will depend on the outcome of legislative and regulatory initiatives
as well as the bank insurance funds loss experience and other factors which
the company is necessarily unable to predict any increase in premiums would
have an adverse effect on the companys earnings

     under the fdicia insurance of deposits may be terminated by the fdic
upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound
practices is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has
violated any applicable law regulation rule order or condition imposed by
a banks federal regulatory agency

depositor preference

     the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 provides for a domestic
depositor preference on amounts realized from the liquidation or other
resolution of any depository institution insured by the fdic

acquisitions

     the bhc act generally limits acquisitions by bank holding companies that
have not qualified as financial holding companies to commercial banks and
companies engaged in activities that the federal reserve board has determined
to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto  as a
financial holding company however the company is also permitted to acquire
companies engaged in activities that are financial in nature and in activities
that are incidental and complementary to financial activities without prior
federal reserve board approval

     the bhc act the federal bank merger act the new york banking law and
other state statutes regulate the acquisition of commercial banks  the bhc
act requires the prior approval of the federal reserve board for the direct or
indirect acquisition of more than 5 of the voting shares of a commercial
bank

     the riegleneal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of 1994
ibbea permits bank holding companies with federal reserve board approval
to acquire banks located in states other than the bank holding companys home
state without regard to whether the transaction is permitted under state law
in addition ibbea provides that national banks and state banks with different
home states are permitted to merge across state lines with the approval of
the appropriate federal banking agency unless the home state of a
participating bank passed legislation between the date of enactment of ibbea
and may 31 1997 expressly prohibiting interstate mergers  most states

page 9

including new york new jersey and connecticut have not passed legislation
prohibiting interstate mergers  a bank may also establish and operate a de
novo branch in a state in which the bank does not maintain a branch if that
state expressly permits de novo branching  once a bank has established
branches in a state through an interstate merger transaction the bank may
establish and acquire additional branches at any location in the state where
any bank involved in the interstate merger transaction could have established
or acquired branches under applicable federal or state law  a bank that has
established a branch in a state through de novo branching may establish and
acquire additional branches in such state in the same manner and to the same
extent as a bank having a branch in such state as a result of an interstate
merger

     the merger of bny with another bank would require the approval of the
federal reserve board or other federal bank regulatory authority and if the
surviving bank is a new york state bank the new york superintendent of banks

     in reviewing bank acquisition and merger applications the bank
regulatory authorities will consider among other things the competitive
effect of the transaction financial and managerial issues including the
capital position of the combined organization and convenience and needs
factors including the applicants record under the community reinvestment
act

     under federal reserve board policy the company is expected to act as a
source of financial strength to its banks and to commit resources to support
such banks in circumstances where it might not do so absent such policy  in
addition any loans by the company to its banks would be subordinate in right
of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of its banks

restrictions on transfer of funds

     restrictions on the transfer of funds to the company and subsidiary bank
dividend limitations are discussed in note 10 to the consolidated financial
statements included in exhibit 13  such discussion is incorporated herein by
reference

cross guarantees

     under fdicia a financial institution insured by the fdic that is under
common control with a failed or failing fdicinsured institution can be
required to indemnify the fdic for losses resulting from the insolvency of the
failed institution or from assistance to the failing institution even if this
causes the affiliated institution also to become insolvent  any obligation or
liability owed by a subsidiary depository institution to its parent company is
subordinate to the subsidiarys crossguarantee liability with respect to
commonly controlled insured depository institutions and to the rights of
depositors

usa patriot act

     the recently enacted usa patriot act imposes additional obligations on us
financial institutions including the companys bank and broker dealer
subsidiaries to implement policies procedures and controls which are
reasonably designed to detect and report instances of money laundering and the
financing of terrorism  affected subsidiaries have started the process of
compliance with these new requirements  the secretary of the treasury has
also proposed additional regulations to further implement the provisions of
the title iii of the usa patriot act  although the company is unable to
predict when and in what form these regulations will be adopted it is not
anticipated that the cost of compliance will have a material impact on the
companys consolidated financial statements

item 3  legal proceedings

     the company continues to cooperate with investigations by federal and
state law enforcement and bank regulatory authorities the investigations
focus on funds transfer activities in certain accounts at bny principally
involving wire transfers from russian and other sources in eastern europe as
well as certain other matters involving bny and its affiliates the funds
transfer investigations center around accounts controlled by peter berlin his
wife lucy edwards until discharged in september 1999 an officer of bny
and companies and persons associated with them berlin and edwards pled guilty
to various federal criminal charges the company cannot predict when or on
what basis the investigations will conclude or their effect if any on the
company

     on february 8 2000 bny entered into a written agreement with both the
federal reserve bank of new york and the new york state banking department
which imposed a number of reporting requirements and controls substantially
all of these reporting requirements and controls are now in place

     four purported shareholder derivative actions have been filed in
connection with these russian related matters   two in the united states
district court for the southern district of new york and two in the new york
supreme court new york county   against certain directors and officers of
the company and bny alleging that the defendants have breached their fiduciary
duties of due care and loyalty by aggressively pursuing business with russian
banks and entities without implementing sufficient safeguards and failing to
supervise properly those responsible for that business the actions seek on
behalf of the company and bny monetary damages from the defendants
corrective action and attorneys fees on september 1 2000 plaintiffs in the
two federal actions filed an amended consolidated complaint that names all of
the directors and certain officers of bny and the company as defendants
repeats the allegations of the original complaints and adds allegations that
certain officers of bny and the company participated in a scheme to transfer
cash improperly from russia to various offshore accounts and to avoid russian
customs currency and tax laws management believes that the allegations of
both the original complaints and the amended complaint are without merit on
september 12 2000 the boards of directors of bny and the company authorized
a special litigation committee slc to consider the response of bny and the
company to the state and federal court shareholder derivative actions the slc
issued an interim report dated may 21 2001 which concluded that there was no
credible evidence to support the allegations of personal misconduct against
mr renyi and credible evidence that contradicts critical allegations in
the amended complaint in the federal action

     on august 31 2001 defendants moved to dismiss the two actions filed in
the united states district court for the southern district of new york  on
november 27 2001 the federal district court granted defendants motion and
dismissed the two actions  on december 19 2001 plaintiffs filed a notice of
appeal to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit  the
court of appeals has not yet set a briefing or argument schedule

page 22

     on february 1 2002 counsel for plaintiffs in the two federal court
actions filed a shareholder derivative action in new york supreme court new
york county that made allegations substantially similar to the two federal
court actions that were dismissed  the company and bny requested that the new
york state supreme court issue and order consolidating the new state court
shareholder derivative action with the two shareholder derivative actions
previously filed  plaintiffs in the new shareholder derivative action have
opposed consolidation

     the two previously filed state court derivative actions which do not
include any allegations of personal misconduct are still pending  the
parties are currently undertaking courtappointed mediation

     additionally on october 7 1999 six alleged depositors of joint stock
bank inkombank inkombank a russian bank filed a purported class action
in the united states district court for the southern district of new york on
behalf of all depositors of inkombank who lost their deposits when that bank
collapsed in 1998 the complaint as subsequently amended twice alleges that
the company and bny and their senior officers knew about and aided and
abetted the looting of inkombank by its principals and participated in a
scheme to transfer cash improperly from russia to various offshore accounts
and to avoid russian customs currency and tax laws the amended complaint
asserts causes of action for conversion and aiding and abetting conversion
under new york law in addition the amended complaint states a claim under
the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico on march 21
2001 the court dismissed the second amended complaint without leave to
replead on january 14 2002 the united states court of appeals for the
second circuit vacated the dismissal of the second amended complaint because
it disagreed with one ground of the district courts dismissal and remanded
the case to the lower court to consider alternate bases for dismissal  the
company and bny believe that the allegations made in this action are without
merit and intend to defend the action vigorously

     on october 24 2000 three alleged shareholders of inkombank filed an
action in the supreme court new york county against the company bny and
inkombank the complaint alleges that the defendants fraudulently induced the
plaintiffs to refrain from redeeming their alleged 40 million investment in
inkombank the complaint asserts a single cause of action for fraud seeking
40 million plus 12 interest from january 1994 punitive damages costs
interest and attorney fees on january 8 2001 the company and bny moved to
dismiss the complaint as against them  on january 10 2002 the court denied
that motion on january 25 2002 the company and bny filed their answer to
plaintiffs complaint  on february 14 2002 the company and bny filed a
motion asking the court for leave to reargue their motion to dismiss the
complaint the company and bny believe that the allegations of the complaint
are without merit and intend to defend the action vigorously

     the company does not expect that any of the foregoing civil actions will
have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements

     in the ordinary course of business there are various legal claims
pending against the company and its subsidiaries in the opinion of
management liabilities arising from such claims if any would not have a
material effect on the companys consolidated financial statements
