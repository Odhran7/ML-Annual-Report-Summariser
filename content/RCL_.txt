industry 

the cruising industry has been considered a wellestablished vacation sector in the north american european and australian markets and a developing sector in several other emerging markets as the industry proceeds with its resumption of operations we believe that cruising will continue to be a popular vacation choice in the longterm due to its inherent value extensive itineraries and variety of shipboard and shoreside activities 

the company and other industry participants voluntarily suspended operations in march of 2020 and gradually resumed operations in the second half of 2021 resulting in a limited number of operated cruises in 2020 and 2021 as a result representative information of market penetration and other indicators are not meaningful for 2020 and 2021 for the five year period prior to 2020 industry data indicated that market penetration rates were still low and that a significant portion of cruise guests carried in those years were firsttime cruisers we believe this presents an opportunity for operational and financial recovery and longterm growth for the industry as it continues to resume operations

cruise pricing 

our cruise ticket prices include accommodations and a wide variety of activities and amenities including meals and entertainment prices vary depending on many factors including the destination cruise length stateroom category selected and the time of year the cruise takes place in response to covid19 we established flexible cruise pricing programs ie cruise with confidence best price guarantee and allinclusive pricing that present our guests with options and value 

although we grant credit terms in select markets mainly outside of the united states our payment terms generally require an upfront deposit to confirm a reservation with the balance due prior to the sailing our cruises are generally available for sale at least one year in advance and often more than two years in advance of sailing during the selling period of a cruise we continually monitor and adjust our cruise ticket prices for available guest staterooms based on demand with the objective of maximizing net yields 

as our business has grown globally our sale arrangements with travel advisors may vary for instance although our direct business has historically grown at a rapid pace sale arrangements through travel advisor charter and group sales are proportionately higher in the china market than in our other markets which are primarily through retail agency and direct sales 

we have developed and implemented enhancements to our reservations system that provide us and our travel partners with additional capabilities making it easier to do business with us for example we offer air transportation to our guests through our air transportation program available in major cities around the world 

passenger ticket revenues accounted for approximately 61 68 and 72 of total revenues in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

onboard activities and other revenues 

our cruise brands offer modern fleets with a wide array of onboard services amenities and activities which vary by brand and ship while many onboard activities are included in the base price of a cruise we realize additional revenues from among other things gaming the sale of alcoholic and other beverages internet and other telecommunication services gift shop items shore excursions photography spasalon and fitness services art auctions retail shops and a wide variety of specialty restaurants and dining options many of these services are available for prebooking prior to embarkation these activities are offered either directly by us or by independent concessionaires from which we receive a percentage of their revenues the allinclusive pricing programs that we offer currently add some of these onboard activity and other services to the base price of the cruise 

in conjunction with our cruise vacations we offer pre and postcruise hotel packages to our royal caribbean international celebrity cruises and silversea cruises guests we also offer cruise vacation protection coverage to guests in a number of markets which provides guests with coverage for trip cancellation medical protection and baggage protection onboard and other revenues accounted for approximately 39 32 and 28 of total revenues in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

segment reporting 

we control and operate three cruise brands royal caribbean international celebrity cruises and silversea cruises in addition we have a 50 joint venture interest in tuic our 50owned joint venture that operates the german brands tui cruises and hapaglloyd cruises we believe our brands possess the versatility to enter multiple cruise market segments within the cruise vacation industry although each of our brands has its own marketing style as well as ships and crews of various sizes the nature of the products sold and services delivered by our brands share a common base ie the sale and provision of cruise vacations our brands also have similar itineraries as well as similar cost and revenue components in addition our brands source passengers from similar markets around the world and operate in similar economic environments with a significant degree of commercial overlap as a result our brands have been aggregated as a single reportable segment based on the similarity of their economic characteristics types of consumers regulatory environment maintenance requirements supporting systems and processes as well as products and services provided our president and chief executive officer has been identified as the chief operating decisionmaker and all significant operating decisions including the allocation of resources are based upon the analyses of the company as one segment  for financial information see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data

insurance 

we maintain insurance on the hull and machinery of our ships with insured values generally equal to the net book value of each ship this coverage is maintained with reputable insurance underwriters from the british scandinavian french united states and other reputable international insurance markets 

we are members of four protection and indemnity pi clubs which are part of a worldwide group of 13 pi clubs known as the international group of pi clubs the “ig” liabilities costs and expenses for illness and injury to crew guest injury pollution and other thirdparty claims in connection with our cruise activities are covered by our pi clubs subject to the clubs’ rules and the limits of coverage determined by the ig pi coverage provided by the clubs is on a mutual basis and we are subject to additional premium calls in the event of a catastrophic loss incurred by any member of the 13 pi clubs whereby the reinsurance limits purchased by the ig are exhausted we are also subject to additional premium calls based on investment and underwriting shortfalls experienced by our own individual insurers 

we maintain war risk insurance for legal liability to crew guests and other third parties as well as for loss or damage to our vessels arising from acts of war including invasion insurrection terrorism rebellion piracy and hijacking our primary war risk coverage is provided by a norwegian war risk insurance association and our excess war risk insurance is provided by our four pi clubs consistent with most marine war risk policies our coverage is subject to cancellation in the event of a change in risk in the event of a war between major powers our primary policies terminate after thirty days’ 

notice and our excess policies terminate immediately our excess policies are also subject to cancellation after a notice period of seven days in the event of other changes in risk these notice periods allow for premiums to be renegotiated based on changes in risk 

insurance coverage for other exposures such as shoreside property and casualty passenger offvessel directors and officers and network security and privacy are maintained with various global insurance companies 

we do not carry business interruption insurance for our ships based on our evaluation of the risks involved and protective measures already in place as compared to the cost of insurance 

all insurance coverage is subject to certain limitations exclusions and deductible levels in addition in certain circumstances we either selfinsure or coinsure a portion of these risks premiums charged by insurance carriers including carriers in the maritime insurance industry increase or decrease from time to time and tend to be cyclical in nature these cycles are impacted both by our own loss experience and by losses incurred in direct and reinsurance markets we historically have been able to obtain insurance coverage in amounts and at premiums we have deemed to be commercially acceptable no assurance can be given that affordable and secure insurance markets will be available to us in the future particularly for war risk insurance 

trademarks 

we own a number of registered trademarks related to the royal caribbean international celebrity cruises and silversea cruises cruise brands the registered trademarks include the name “royal caribbean international” and its crown and anchor logo the name “celebrity cruises” and its “x” logo the name “silversea cruises” and its logo and the names of various cruise ships ship venues and other marketing programs we believe our largest brands trademarks are widely recognized throughout the world and have considerable value the duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country however trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use andor their registrations are properly maintained 

regulation 

our ships are regulated by various international national state and local laws regulations and treaties in force in the jurisdictions in which they operate in addition our ships are registered in the bahamas malta or in the case of our ships operating in the galapagos islands ecuador each ship is subject to regulations issued by its country of registry including regulations issued pursuant to international treaties governing the safety of our ships guests and crew as well as environmental protection each country of registry conducts periodic inspections to verify compliance with these regulations as discussed more fully below ships operating out of ports of call around the world are also subject to inspection by the maritime authorities of that country for compliance with international treaties and local regulations additionally ships operating out of the united states ports are subject to inspection by the united states coast guard for compliance with international treaties and by the united states public health service for sanitary and health conditions our ships are also subject to similar inspections pursuant to the laws and regulations of various other countries our ships visit 

we believe that we are in material compliance with all the regulations applicable to our ships and that we have all licenses necessary to conduct our business health safety security environmental and financial responsibility issues are and we believe will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant government authorities in the united states and internationally from time to time various regulatory and legislative changes may be implemented that could impact our operations and subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 

cdc covid19 program for cruise ships operating in us waters 

beginning in october 2020 our ships home porting or calling in us ports operated under a framework for conditional sailing order “cso” issued by the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc that permitted cruise ship passenger operations in us waters subject to certain conditions and safety protocols the cso which had been modified over time expired on january 15 2022 on february 9 2022 the cdc published a covid19 program the “program” for cruise vessels sailing in us waters under the program persons traveling on cruise ships designated as “highly vaccinated” do not have to wear a mask in any areas onboard and are not subject to physical distancing protocols cruise lines may opt into the program on a voluntary basis cruise lines may also opt out at any time we have voluntarily optedin to the cdc’s program beginning with sailings departing on or after february 25 2022 and have designated all ships across our brands as “highly vaccinated” vessels going forward the cdc may issue additional recommendations or requirements through technical instructions to the program we plan to continue to monitor and evaluate any further cdc guidance based on our assessment of thencurrent epidemiological conditions and applicable health and safety protocols 

safety and security regulations 

our ships are required to comply with international safety standards defined in the international convention for safety of life at sea “solas” which among other things establish requirements for ship design structural features materials construction lifesaving equipment and safe management and operation of ships for guest and crew safety the solas standards are revised from time to time and incorporated in our ship design and operation as applicable the latest enhancements include the addition of the polar code which sets goalbased standards for ships operating in the polar region as well as damage stability requirements for new designs and operational measures for existing vessels compliance with these modified standards have not historically had a material effect on our operating costs solas incorporates the international safety management code “ism code” which provides an international standard for the safe management and operation of ships and for pollution prevention the ism code is mandatory for all vessels including passenger vessel operators 

all of our operations and ships are regularly audited by various national authorities and we are required to maintain the relevant certificates of compliance with the ism code 

our ships are subject to various security requirements including the international ship and port facility security code “isps code” which is part of solas and the us maritime transportation security act of 2002 “mtsa” which applies to ships that operate in us ports in order to satisfy these security requirements we implement security measures conduct vessel security assessments and develop security plans the security plans for all of our ships have been submitted to and approved by the recognized security organization on behalf of the ships flag state and are in compliance with the isps code and the mtsa 

the cruise vessel security and safety act of 2010 which applies to passenger vessels which embark or include port stops within the united states requires the implementation of certain safety design features as well as the establishment of practices for the reporting of and dealing with allegations of crime the cruise industry supported this legislation and we believe that our internal standards are generally as strict or stricter than the law requires some provisions of the act call for regulations which have not been finalized we do not expect the pending regulations will have a material impact to our operations 

environmental regulations 

we are subject to various international and national laws and regulations relating to environmental protection under such laws and regulations we are generally prohibited from discharging materials other than food waste into the waterways we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations from time to time environmental and other regulators consider more stringent regulations which may affect our operations and increase our compliance costs we believe that the impact of ships on the global environment will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world and accordingly may subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future including the items described below 

our ships are subject to the international maritime organization’s ‘‘imo’’ regulations under the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships the ‘‘marpol regulations’’ and the international convention for the control and management of ships ballast water and sediments ballast water management convention in addition to other regional and national regulations such as eu directives and the us vessel general permit which includes requirements designed to minimize pollution by oil sewage garbage air emissions and the transfer of nonnativenonindigenous species we have obtained the relevant international compliance certificates relating to oil sewage air pollution prevention and ballast water for all of our ships 

the marpol regulations imposed reduced global limitations on the sulfur content of emissions emitted by ships operating worldwide to 05 as of january 1 2020 which was reduced from 35 as we continue our gradual resumption of operations we do not expect for this increased limitation to have a material impact to our results of operations largely due to a number of mitigating steps we have taken over the last several years including equipping all of our new ships delivered during or after 2014 with advanced emissions purification aep systems covering all engines and actively developing and installing aep systems on the majority of our remaining fleet resulting in 70 of our fleet being equipped with aep systems 

the marpol regulations also establish special emission control areas ecas with additional stringent limitations on sulfur emissions in these areas there are four established ecas that restrict sulfur emissions the baltic sea the north seaenglish channel certain waters surrounding the north american coast and the waters surrounding puerto rico and the us virgin islands the caribbean eca ships operating in these sulfur ecas have been required to 

reduce their emissions sulfur content to 01 this reduction has not had a significant impact on our results of operations to date due to the mitigating steps described above 

we continue to implement our aep system strategy for both our ships on order and our existing fleet as our new ships are delivered with aep systems or other mitigating technologies liquified natural gas lng fuels fuel cells etc and additional existing ships are retrofitted with aep systems they will provide us with additional operational and deployment flexibility 

additionally all new ships operating within the north american and us caribbean sea eca that began construction on or after january 1 2016 and north and baltic sea ships constructed on or after january 1 2021 are required to meet more stringent nitrogen oxide emission limits we comply with these rules for those relevant ships in service as an added measure all of our ships under construction are being built to comply with these rules the rules have not had and are not expected to have a significant impact to our operations or costs 

in november of 2020 imo approved amendments to the marpol convention that will require ships beginning in 2023 to combine a technical and an operational approach energy efficiency existing ship index eexi and carbon intensity indicator cii to reduce their carbon intensity in line with the ambition of the initial imo ghg strategy which aims to reduce carbon intensity of international shipping by 40 by 2030 compared to 2008 while there is still work to be completed ahead of these amendments being implemented the approved framework for the eexi amendment is not expected to have a material impact on our operations however the framework for cii could have a negative impact on our itinerary flexibility for certain of our ships depending on the final operational measures needed to comply 

effective july 1 2015 the european commission adopted legislation that requires cruise ship operators with ships visiting ports in the european union to monitor and report on the ship’s annual carbon dioxide emissions starting in 2018 additionally in 2019 the imos monitoring and reporting system imo data and collection system which is applicable to all ship itineraries entered into force while compliance with these regulations did not materially impact our costs or results of operations the legislations contemplate further obligations and restrictions which could ultimately result in additional costs or charges associated with carbon dioxide emissions 

the imo ballast water management convention which came into effect in 2017 requires ships that carry and discharge ballast water to meet specific discharge standards by installing ballast water treatment systems by 2023 compliance with this regulation has not had a material effect on our results of operations and we do not expect the continuing compliance with this regulation to have a material effect on our results of operations 

refer to item 1a risk factors  environmental labor health and safety financial responsibility and other maritime regulations could affect operations and increase costs for further discussion of the risks associated with the regulations discussed above  

consumer financial responsibility regulations 

we are required to obtain certificates from the united states federal maritime commission relating to our ability to satisfy liability in cases of nonperformance of obligations to guests as well as casualty and personal injury as a condition to obtaining the required certificates we generally arrange through our insurers for the provision of surety for our shipoperating companies the required amount is currently 320 million per operator and is subject to additional consumer price index based adjustments 

we are also required by the united kingdom norway finland and the baltics to establish our financial responsibility for any liability resulting from the nonperformance of our obligations to guests from these jurisdictions in the united kingdom we are currently required by the association of british travel agents to provide performance bonds totaling approximately £124 million additionally we were required by the civil aviation authority to provide performance bonds totaling £185 million the norwegian travel guarantee fund requires us to maintain performance bonds in varying amounts during the course of the year to cover our financial responsibility in norway finland and the baltics 

certain other jurisdictions also require that we establish financial responsibility to our guests resulting from the nonperformance of our obligations however the related amounts do not have a material effect on our costs 

taxation of the company 

the following is a summary of our principal taxes exemptions and special regimes in addition to or instead of income taxation virtually all jurisdictions where our ships call impose some tax or fee or both based on guest headcount tonnage or some other measure we also collect and remit value added tax vat or sales tax in many jurisdictions where 

we operate 

our consolidated operations are primarily foreign corporations engaged in the owning and operating of passenger cruise ships in international transportation 

us income taxation 

the following is a discussion of the application of the us federal and state income tax laws to us and is based on the current provisions of the us internal revenue code treasury department regulations administrative rulings court decisions and the relevant state tax laws regulations rulings and court decisions of the states where we have business operations all of the foregoing is subject to change and any such change could affect the accuracy of this discussion 

application of section 883 of the internal revenue code 

royal caribbean cruises ltd celebrity cruises inc and silversea cruises ltd are engaged in a trade or business in the united states and many of our shipowning subsidiaries depending upon the itineraries of their ships receive income from sources within the united states silversea cruises ltd and our united kingdom tonnage tax company are classified as disregarded entities or divisions for us federal income tax purposes that may earn us source income under section 883 of the internal revenue code certain foreign corporations may exclude from gross income and effectively from branch profits tax as such earnings do not give rise to effectively connected earnings and profits us source income derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships including income from the leasing of such ships 

a foreign corporation will qualify for the benefits of section 883 if in relevant part 1 the foreign country in which the foreign corporation is organized grants an equivalent exemption to corporations organized in the united states and 2 the stock of the corporation or the direct or indirect corporate parent thereof is “primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market” in the united states in the opinion of our us tax counsel faegre drinker biddle  reath llp based on the representations and assumptions set forth in that opinion royal caribbean cruises ltd including silversea cruises ltd celebrity cruises inc and relevant shipowning subsidiaries with us source shipping income qualify for the benefits of section 883 because royal caribbean cruises ltd and each of those subsidiaries are incorporated in liberia which is a qualifying country and our common stock is primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market in the united states ie we are a “publicly traded” corporation if in the future 1 liberia no longer qualifies as an equivalent exemption jurisdiction and we do not reincorporate in a jurisdiction that does qualify for the exemption or 2 we fail to qualify as a publicly traded corporation we and all of our shipowning or operating subsidiaries that rely on section 883 to exclude qualifying income from gross income would be subject to us federal income tax on their us source shipping income and income from activities incidental thereto 

we believe that most of our income and the income of our shipowning subsidiaries is derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships and therefore is exempt from taxation under section 883 

regulations under section 883 list activities that are not considered by the internal revenue service to be incidental to the international operation of ships including the sale of air and land transportation shore excursions and pre and postcruise tours our income from these activities that is earned from sources within the united states will be subject to us taxation 

taxation in the absence of an exemption under section 883 

if royal caribbean cruises ltd the operator of our vessels celebrity cruises inc or our shipowning subsidiaries were to fail to meet the requirements of section 883 of the internal revenue code or if the provision was repealed then as explained below such companies would be subject to us income taxation on a portion of their income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships 

because royal caribbean cruises ltd and celebrity cruises inc conduct a trade or business in the united states royal caribbean cruises ltd including silversea cruises ltd and celebrity cruises inc would be taxable at regular corporate rates on our separate company taxable income ie without regard to the income of our shipowning subsidiaries on income which is effectively connected with our us trade or business generally only income from us sources in addition if any of our earnings and profits effectively connected with our us trade or business were withdrawn or were deemed to have been withdrawn from our us trade or business those withdrawn amounts would be subject to a “branch profits” tax at the rate of 30 royal caribbean cruises ltd which includes silversea cruises ltd for tax purposes and celebrity cruises inc would also be potentially subject to tax on portions of certain interest paid by us at rates of up to 30 

if section 883 were not available to our shipowning subsidiaries each such subsidiary would be subject to a special 4 tax on its us source gross transportation income if any each year because it does not have a fixed place of business in the united states and its income is derived from the leasing of a ship 

other united states taxation 

royal caribbean cruises ltd which includes silversea cruises ltd and celebrity cruises inc earn us source income from activities not considered incidental to international shipping the tax on such income is not material to our results of operation for all years presented 

state taxation 

royal caribbean cruises ltd celebrity cruises inc and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various us state income taxes which are generally imposed on each state’s portion of the us source income subject to federal income taxes additionally the state of alaska subjects an allocated portion of the total income of companies doing business in alaska and certain other affiliated companies to alaska corporate state income taxes and also imposes a 33 tax on adjusted gross income from onboard gambling activities conducted in alaska waters this did not have a material impact to our results of operations for all years presented 

united kingdom income taxation 

during the year ended december 31 2021 we operated 17 ships under the united kingdom tonnage tax regime “uk tonnage tax” 

companies subject to uk tonnage tax pay a corporate tax on a notional profit determined with reference to the net tonnage of qualifying vessels the requirements for a company to qualify for the uk tonnage tax regime include being subject to uk corporate income tax operating qualifying ships which are strategically and commercially managed in the united kingdom and fulfilling a seafarer training requirement 

relevant shipping profits include income from the operation of qualifying ships and from shipping related activities our uk income from nonshipping activities which do not qualify under the uk tonnage tax regime and which are not considered significant remain subject to regular uk corporate income tax 

other taxation 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to valueadded and other indirect taxes most of which are reclaimable zerorated or exempt

we have been and continue to be negatively impacted by the covid19 pandemic including impacts that resulted or may result from actions taken in response to the outbreak and the occurrence and spread of related variants examples of these include but are not limited to cruising advisories and required or voluntary travel restrictions that resulted in the temporary suspension of our global brands operations from which we have resumed limited operations restrictions on the movement and gathering of people social distancing measures shelterinplacestayathome orders and disruptions to businesses in our supply chain in addition to the restrictions affecting our business the extent duration and magnitude of the covid19 pandemic’s effect on the economy and consumer demand for cruising and travel is evolving and difficult to predict as such these impacts may persist for an extended period of time or even become more pronounced even as we resume operations 

the covid19 pandemic also has elevated risks affecting significant parts of our business 

• operations while we have restarted our global cruise operations in a phased manner following the march 2020 suspension of our global cruise operations there is no assurance that our plan to resume operations will be successful it is possible that future covid19 cases could occur onboard and even if controlled and contained it is uncertain whether we will need to suspend additional sailings and to what extent in such event onboard cases have resulted in illness among our guests and crew incremental costs guest refunds and negative publicity and media attention in addition we may face challenges in executing our return to service plans as a result of new and evolving operating protocols including due to state laws regarding proof of vaccination requirements and related litigation and possible changes in regulations in the countries in which we operate and plan to operate 

uncertainties remain as to the specifics timing and costs of administering and implementing our health and safety measures some of which may be significant these measures also may negatively impact guest satisfaction based on our assessment of these requirements and recommendations the status of covid19 infection andor vaccination rates in the us or globally or for other reasons we may determine it necessary to cancel or modify certain of our global brands’ cruise sailings in addition there is no guarantee that the vaccines will be effective we believe the impact to our global bookings resulting from covid19 will continue to have a material negative impact on our results of operations and liquidity which may be prolonged beyond containment of the disease and its variants 

our previous suspension of sailings and our gradual resumption of operations has led to a significant decline in our revenues and cash inflows which required us to take cost and capital expenditure containment actions consequently we reduced and furloughed some of our workforce with approximately 23 of our us shoreside employee base being impacted in 2020 our ships and our shipboard crew are gradually being notified about new assignments as operations resume over time we may be challenged in rebuilding the rest of our workforce which could delay our phased resumption of operations in addition we have reduced our planned capital spending through 2022 which may negatively impact or delay our execution of planned growth strategies particularly as it relates to investments in our ships technology and our expansion of landbased developments we also have taken actions to monitor and mitigate changes in our supply chain and port destination availability which may strain relationships with our vendors and port partners 

if we are unable to satisfy the safety standards applicable to our sailings our operations may be negatively impacted and we could be exposed to reputational and legal risks due to the unprecedented and uncertain nature of the covid19 pandemic and related regulatory landscape it is difficult to predict the impact of further disruptions and their magnitude in addition we have never previously experienced a complete cessation of our cruising operations or a subsequent phased resumption of operations and as a consequence we are unable to predict the precise impact of such a cessation or phased resumption of operations on our brands and future prospects 

• results of operations our suspensions of sailings have materially impacted the results of our operations we have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs as we accommodate passengers due to cancelled sailings in addition we have 

incurred and will likely continue to incur significant overhead costs associated with the return to service of our fleet and enhanced covid19 related cleaning testing vaccination and other mitigation procedures we may experience volatility in demand for cruising for an indeterminable length of time due to the uncertain nature of the covid19 pandemic and ongoing concerns about health and safety and we cannot predict when we will return to prepandemic demand or fare pricing or if we will return to such levels in the foreseeable future in turn these negative impacts to our financial performance have resulted and may continue to result in impairments of our longlived and intangible assets which has influenced our decision making relating to early disposal sale or retirement of assets following the resumption of operations our global brands and our partner brands may be subject to the continued impact of the covid19 pandemic additionally any future profitability will be impacted by increased debt service costs as a result of our liquidity actions 

• liquidity the suspension of our sailings and the reduction in demand for future cruising adversely impacted our liquidity and we have continued to experience higher than historical levels of refunds of customer deposits while cash inflows from new or existing bookings on future sailings are below prepandemic levels as a result we have taken actions to increase our liquidity through a combination of operating and capital expense reductions and increased financing activities refer to note 8 debt to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplemental data for further discussion of our 2021 financing activities 

we have agreed with certain of our lenders that we will not pay dividends or engage in stock repurchases until after the third quarter of 2022 thereafter in the event we declare a dividend or engage in stock repurchases we will need to repay the amounts deferred under our export credit facilities on february 25 2021 sp global further downgraded our senior unsecured rating from b to b which had no financial impact and downgraded our senior secured notes which were partially repaid in august 2021 and silversea notes which were fully repaid in june 2021 with the proceeds from the 650 million june unsecured notes from bb to bb this downgrade had no impact on the terms of the notes our ability to raise additional financing whether or not secured could be limited if our credit rating is further downgraded andor if we fail to comply with applicable covenants governing our outstanding indebtedness andor if overall financial market conditions worsen additionally due to the complexity of the pandemic’s impact to the economy and uncertainty of its duration we cannot guarantee that assumptions used to project our liquidity needs will be correct which may result in the need for additional financing andor may result in the inability to satisfy covenants required by our current credit facilities if we continue to raise additional funds through equity or convertible debt issuances our shareholders could experience dilution of their ownership interest and these equity or convertible debt securities could have rights preferences and privileges that are superior to that of holders of our ordinary shares if we raise additional funds by issuing debt we may be subject to additional limitations on our operations due to restrictive covenants which may be more restrictive than the covenants in our existing debt agreements and we may be required to further encumber our assets also as a result of our additional debt issuances we will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain operations our ability to generate cash depends on factors beyond our control and we may be unable to repay or repurchase debt at maturity if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms or at all we may be unable to fund our operations or respond to competitive pressures any of which could negatively affect our business there is no guarantee that financing will be available in the future or that such financing will be available with similar terms or terms that are commercially acceptable to us further if any government agrees to provide us with disaster relief assistance or other assistance due to the impacts of the covid19 pandemic and we determine it is beneficial to seek such government assistance it may impose restrictions on share buybacks dividends prepayment of debt executive compensation or other areas of our business until the aid is repaid or redeemed in full which could significantly limit our corporate activities and adversely impact our business and operations we cannot assure you that any such disaster relief would be available to us 

we may not be able to obtain sufficient financing or capital for our needs or may not be able to do so on terms that are acceptable or consistent with our expectations 

to fund our capital expenditures including new ship orders operations and scheduled debt payments we have historically relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations drawdowns under available credit facilities the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the sale of equity or debt securities in private or public securities markets any circumstance or event which leads to a decrease in consumer cruise spending such as worsening global economic conditions or significant incidents impacting the cruise industry such as the covid19 pandemic negatively affects our operating cash flows we had net cash outflows from operations for the twelve months ended december 31 2021 as result of the covid19 pandemic and the resulting suspension of our operations we have experienced credit rating downgrades which may reduce our ability to incur secured indebtedness by reducing the amount of indebtedness that we are permitted to secure and may negatively impact our access to and cost of debt financing 

our ability to access additional funding as and when needed our ability to timely refinance andor replace our outstanding debt securities and credit facilities on acceptable terms and our cost of funding will depend upon numerous factors including but not limited to the strength of the financial markets our recovery and financial performance the recovery and performance of our industry in general and the size scope and timing of our financial needs in addition even where financing commitments have been secured 

significant disruptions in the capital and credit markets could cause our banking and other counterparties to breach their contractual obligations to us or could cause the conditions to the availability of such funding not to be satisfied this could include failures of banks or other financial service companies to fund required borrowings under our loan agreements or to pay us amounts that may become due or return collateral that is refundable under our derivative contracts for hedging of fuel prices interest rates and foreign currencies or other agreements if any of the foregoing occurs for a prolonged period of time it will have a longterm negative impact on our cash flows and our ability to meet our financial obligations 

our substantial debt requires a significant amount of cash to service and could adversely affect our financial condition 

we have a substantial amount of debt and significant debt service obligations as of december 31 2021 we had total debt of 211 billion our substantial debt has required us to dedicate a large portion of our cash flow from operations to service debt and fund repayments on our debt thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate expenses 

our ability to make future scheduled payments on our debt service obligations or refinance our debt depends on our future operating and financial performance and ability to generate cash this will be affected by our ability to successfully implement our business strategy as well as general economic financial competitive regulatory and other factors beyond our control such as the disruption caused by the covid19 pandemic if we cannot generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service obligations or fund our other business needs we may among other things need to refinance all or a portion of our debt obtain additional financing delay planned capital expenditures or sell assets we cannot assure that we will be able to generate sufficient cash through any of the foregoing if we are not able to refinance any of our debt obtain additional financing or sell assets on commercially reasonable terms or at all we may not be able to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt 

our substantial debt could also result in other negative consequences for us for example it could increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic or industry conditions limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or the industry in which we operate place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business the economy or the industry in which we operate including the current downturn related to covid19 limit our ability to raise additional debt or equity capital in the future to satisfy our requirements relating to working capital capital expenditures development projects strategic initiatives or other purposes restrict us from making strategic acquisitions introducing new technologies or exploiting business opportunities limit or restrict our ability to obtain and maintain performance bonds to cover our financial responsibility requirements in various jurisdictions for nonperformance of guest travel casualty and personal injury make it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt and increase our exposure to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings are and may be in the future at a variable rate of interest 

despite our leverage we may incur more debt which could adversely affect our business 

we may incur substantial additional debt in the future except for the restrictions under the indentures governing our 10875 and 115 senior secured notes due 2023 and 2025 respectively the “secured notes” and our 9125 senior guaranteed notes due 2023 the “priority guaranteed notes” and certain of our other debt instruments including our unsecured bank and export credit facilities we are not restricted under the terms of our debt instruments from incurring additional debt although the indentures governing the secured notes the unsecured notes and certain of our other debt instruments including our unsecured bank and export credit facilities contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and under certain circumstances the amount of debt that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial in the event that we execute and borrow under the 7000 million commitment available to draw on at any time prior to august 12 2022 for a 364day term loan facility the credit agreement that would govern such term loan facility would impose substantially similar restrictions including the related qualifications and exceptions as are set forth in the indenture governing the unsecured notes if new debt is added to our existing debt levels the related risks that we now face would increase as of december 31 2021 we have commitments for approximately 100 billion of debt to finance the purchase of 9 ships on order by our royal caribbean international celebrity cruises and silversea cruises brands all of which are guaranteed by the export credit agencies in the countries in which the ships are being built the ultimate size of each facility will depend on the final contract price including change orders and owner’s supply as well as fluctuations in the eurusd exchange rate 

we are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities in addition if we fail to comply with any of these restrictions it could have a material adverse effect on us 

certain of our debt instruments including our indentures and our unsecured bank and export credit facilities limit our flexibility in operating our business for example certain of our loan agreements and indentures restrict or limit our and our subsidiaries’ ability to among other things incur or guarantee additional indebtedness pay dividends or distributions on or redeem or repurchase capital stock and make other restricted payments make investments consummate certain asset sales engage in certain transactions with affiliates grant or assume certain liens and consolidate merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets in addition both our 

export credit facilities and our nonexport credit facilities contain covenants that will once our current waivers expire require us among other things to maintain a specified minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and limit our net debttocapital ratio in addition our eca facility amendments also require us to maintain minimum liquidity and a minimum stock holders equity refer to note 8 debt to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplemental data for further discussion on our covenants and existing waivers 

all of these limitations are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications despite these exceptions and qualifications we cannot assure you that the operating and financial restrictions and covenants in certain of our debt instruments will not adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest any future indebtedness may include similar or other restrictive terms in addition our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control these include prevailing economic financial and industry conditions if we breach any of these covenants or restrictions we could be in default under such indebtedness and certain of our other debt instruments and the relevant debt holders or lenders could elect to declare the debt together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees if any immediately due and payable and proceed against any collateral securing that debt if the debt under certain of our debt instruments that we enter into were to be accelerated our liquid assets may be insufficient to repay in full such indebtedness borrowings under other debt instruments that contain crossdefault provisions also may be accelerated or become payable on demand in these circumstances our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness and our other indebtedness then outstanding 

in addition our ability to maintain our credit facilities may also be impacted by changes in our ownership base more specifically we may be required to prepay our noneca and eca facilities if any person acquires ownership of more than 50 of our common stock or subject to certain exceptions during any 24month period a majority of our board of directors is no longer comprised of individuals who were members of our board of directors on the first day of such period our public debt securities also contain change of control provisions that would be triggered by a thirdparty acquisition of greater than 50 of our common stock coupled with a ratings downgrade which would require us to offer to repurchase our public debt securities in the event of such change of control 

if we elect to settle conversions of our convertible notes in shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock conversions of our convertible notes will result in dilution for our existing shareholders 

we have an aggregate principal amount of 1725 billion in convertible notes outstanding if note holders elect to convert the notes will be converted into our shares of common stock cash or a combination of common stock and cash at our discretion prior to march 15 and august 15 2023 our convertible notes issued june 2020 and october 2020 respectively will be convertible at the option of holders during certain periods only upon satisfaction of certain conditions beyond those dates the convertible notes will be convertible at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding their maturity date conversions of our convertible notes in shares of our common stock or a combination of common stock and cash will result in dilution to our shareholders 

we did not declare quarterly dividends on our common stock in 2021 and do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future 

no cash dividends were declared on our common stock during the year ended december 31 2021 we expect that any income received from operations will be devoted to our future operations and recovery we do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future due to our agreement with certain of our lenders not to pay dividends until the end of the third quarter of 2022 in addition in the event we thereafter declare a dividend we will need to repay our debt deferral payment of dividends would in any case depend upon our profitability at the time cash available for those dividends and other factors as our board of directors may consider relevant 

increased regulatory oversight and the phasing out of libor may adversely affect the value of a portion of our indebtedness 

the publication of certain libor settings ceased after december 31 2021 and uncertainty regarding alternative reference rates remains as many market participants await a wider adoption of replacement products prior to the cessation of the remaining usd libor tenors currently scheduled for june 30 2023 when libor ceases to exist the level of interest payments on the portion of our indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates might be affected if we the agent andor the lenders holding a majority of the outstanding loans or commitments under such indebtedness fail to amend such indebtedness to implement a replacement rate regardless such replacement rate will give due consideration to any evolving or thenexisting conventions for similar credit facilities which may result in different than expected interest payments 

macroeconomic business market and operational risks 

adverse worldwide economic or other conditions could reduce the demand for cruises and passenger spending adversely impacting our operating results cash flows and financial condition including impairing the value of our goodwill ships 

trademarks and other assets and potentially affecting other critical accounting estimates where the change may be material to our operating results 

in addition to health and safety concerns demand for cruises is affected by international national and local economic conditions weak or uncertain economic conditions may impact consumer confidence and pose a risk as vacationers postpone or reduce discretionary spending this in turn may result in cruise booking slowdowns decreased cruise prices and lower onboard revenues given the global nature of our business we are exposed to many different economies and our business could be hurt by challenging conditions in any of our markets additionally the continued impact of covid19 on the financial markets is uncertain and we cannot predict its effect on geopolitical events andor international trade policies as countries attempt to mitigate the impact of the pandemic and as they reopen their economies or reimplement lockdown measures 

our operating costs could increase due to market forces and economic or geopolitical factors beyond our control 

our operating costs including fuel food payroll and benefits airfare taxes insurance and security costs can be and have been subject to increases due to market forces and economic or geopolitical conditions or other factors beyond our control including the global inflationary pressures that we are currently experiencing and that have increased our operating costs in connection with the covid19 pandemic weve incurred increased operating costs including as a result of rerouting itineraries due to ports closing or not accepting passengers increases in these operating costs could adversely affect our future profitability 

any further impairment of our goodwill longlived assets equity investments and notes receivable could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable a challenging operating environment such as is currently being experienced due to the impact of covid19 conditions affecting consumer demand or spending the deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions or other factors could result in a change to the future cash flows we expect to derive from our operations reductions of cash flows used in the valuation analyses may result in the recording of impairments which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results refer to item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations number for further comments on impairments 

price increases for commercial airline services for our guests or major changes or reduction in commercial airline services andor availability could adversely impact the demand for cruises and undermine our ability to provide reasonably priced vacation packages to our guests 

many of our guests depend on scheduled commercial airline services to transport them to or from the ports where our cruises embark or disembark increases in the price of airfare would increase the overall price of the cruise vacation to our guests which may adversely impact demand for our cruises in addition changes in the availability andor regulations governing commercial airline services including those resulting from the covid19 pandemic have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our guests’ ability to obtain air travel as well as our ability to transfer our guests to or from our cruise ships which could adversely affect our results of operations 

terrorist attacks war and other hostilities could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

events such as terrorist attacks war or warlike conditions conflicts domestic or crossborder civil unrest and other hostilities including an escalation in the frequency or severity of incidents and the resulting political instability travel restrictions and advisories and concerns over safety and security aspects of traveling or the fear of any of the foregoing have had and could have in the future a significant adverse impact on demand and pricing in the travel and vacation industry in view of our global operations we are susceptible to a wide range of adverse events these events could also result in additional security measures taken by local authorities which may potentially impact access to ports andor destinations 

disease outbreaks and an increase in concern about the risk of illness could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

disease outbreaks and increased concern related to illness when travelling to from and on our ships could cause a drop in demand for cruises guest cancellations travel restrictions an unavailability of ports andor destinations cruise cancellations ship redeployments and an inability to source our crew provisions or supplies from certain places in addition we may be subject to increased concerns that cruises are more susceptible than other vacation alternatives to the spread of infectious diseases such as covid19 in response to disease outbreaks our industry including our passengers and crew may be subject to enhanced health and safety requirements in the future which may be costly and take a significant amount of time to implement across our fleet for example local governments may establish their own set of rules for selfquarantines andor require proof of individuals health status or vaccination prior to or upon visiting the impact of any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition the new operating protocols we are developing and any other health protocol we may develop or that 

may be required by law in the future in response to infectious diseases may be costly to develop and implement and may be less effective than we expected in reducing the risk of infection and spread of such disease on our cruise ships all of which will negatively impact our operations and expose us to reputational and legal risks 

incidents on ships at port facilities land destinations andor affecting the cruise vacation industry in general and the associated negative media coverage and publicity have affected and could continue to affect our reputation and impact our sales and results of operations 

cruise ships private destinations port facilities and shore excursions operated andor offered by us and third parties may be susceptible to the risk of accidents illnesses mechanical failures environmental incidents and other incidents which could bring into question safety health security and vacation satisfaction and negatively impact our sales operations and reputation incidents involving cruise ships and in particular the safety health and security of guests and crew and the media coverage thereof including those related to the covid19 pandemic have impacted and could continue to impact demand for our cruises and pricing in the industry in particular we cannot predict the impact on our financial performance and the public’s concern regarding the health and safety of travel especially by cruise ship and related decreases in demand for travel and cruising moreover our ability to attract and retain guests and crew depends in part upon the perception and reputation of our company and our brands and the public’s concerns regarding the health and safety of travel generally as well as regarding the cruising industry and our ships specifically our reputation and our business could also be damaged by continued or additional negative publicity regarding the cruise industry in general including publicity regarding the spread of contagious disease such as covid19 overtourism in key ports and destinations and the potentially adverse environmental impacts of cruising the considerable expansion in the use of social and digital media has compounded the potential scope and reach of any negative publicity in addition incidents involving cruise ships may result in additional costs to our business increasing government or other regulatory oversight and in certain cases potential litigation 

significant weather climate events andor natural disasters could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

natural disasters eg earthquakes volcanos wildfires weather andor climate events including hurricanes and typhoons could impact our source markets and operations resulting in travel restrictions guest cancellations an inability to source our crew or our provisions and supplies from certain places we are often forced to alter itineraries and occasionally cancel a cruise or a series of cruises or to redeploy our ships due to these types of events which could have an adverse effect on our sales operating costs and profitability in the current and future periods increases in the frequency severity or duration of these types of events could exacerbate their impact and disrupt our operations or make certain destinations less desirable or unavailable impacting our revenues and profitability further any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and on industry performance 

our sustainability activities including environmental social and governance esg matters could result in reputational risks increased costs and other risks 

customers investors lenders regulators and other industry stakeholders have placed increasing importance on corporate esg practices and on the implications and social cost of their investments which could cause us to incur additional costs and changes to our operations if our esg practices or disclosures do not meet investor or industry stakeholders evolving expectations and standards our customer employee and supply chain vendor retention and our brands and reputation may be negatively impacted which could affect our business operations and financial condition we could also incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor report and comply with various esg practices which could increase our operating costs and affect our results of operations and financial condition 

in addition from time to time we communicate certain initiatives regarding climate change and other esg matters we could fail or be perceived to fail to achieve such initiatives which may negatively affect our reputation the future adoption of new technology or processes to achieve the initiatives could also result in the impairment of existing assets 

our reliance on shipyards their subcontractors and our suppliers to implement our newbuild and ship upgrade programs and to repair and maintain our ships exposes us to risks which could adversely impact our business 

we rely on shipyards their subcontractors and our suppliers to effectively construct our new ships and to repair maintain and upgrade our existing ships on a timely basis and in a costeffective manner there are a limited number of shipyards with the capability and capacity to build repair maintain andor upgrade our ships as such any disruptions affecting the newbuild or fleet modernization supply chain will adversely impact our business as there are limited substitutes 

the covid19 pandemic has led to suspensions andor slowdowns of work at certain shipyards which impacts our ability to construct new ships when and as planned our ability to timely and costeffectively procure new capacity and our ability to execute scheduled drydocks andor fleet modernizations the effects of the covid19 pandemic on the shipyards their subcontractors and our suppliers have resulted in delays in our previously scheduled ship deliveries variations from our plan could have a significant negative impact on our business operations and financial condition 

building repairing maintaining andor upgrading a ship is sophisticated work that involves significant risks material increases in commodity and raw material prices and other cost pressures impacting the construction of a new ship such as the cost of labor and financing could adversely impact the shipyard’s ability to build the ship on a costeffective basis we may be impacted if shipyards their subcontractors andor our suppliers encounter financial difficulties supply chain technical or design problems when building or repairing a ship if materialized these problems could impact the timely delivery or cost of new ships or the ability of shipyards to repair and upgrade our fleet in accordance with our needs or expectations in addition delays mechanical faults andor unforeseen incidents may result in cancellation of cruises or delays of new ship orders or necessitate unscheduled drydocks such events could result in lost revenue increased operating expenses or both and thus adversely affect our results of operations 

an increase in capacity worldwide or excess capacity in a particular market could adversely impact our cruise sales andor pricing 

although our ships can be redeployed cruise sales andor pricing may be impacted by the introduction of new ships into the marketplace reductions in cruise capacity overall market growth and deployment decisions of ourselves and our competitors as of december 31 2021 a total of 78 new ships with approximately 183000 berths were on order for delivery through 2027 in the cruise industry including 12 ships currently scheduled to be delivered to us the further net growth in capacity from these new ships and future orders without an increase in the cruise industry’s demand andor share of the vacation market could depress cruise prices and impede our ability to achieve yield improvement further cruise prices and yield improvement could face additional pressure due to the pace at which we and other cruise line operators return to service 

in addition to the extent that we or our competitors deploy ships to a particular itineraryregion and the resulting capacity in that region exceeds the demand it may negatively affect our pricing and profitability any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition including potentially impairing the value of our ships and other assets 

unavailability of ports of call may adversely affect our results of operations 

we believe that port destinations are a major reason why guests choose to go on a particular cruise or on a cruise vacation the availability of ports and destinations is affected by a number of factors including industry demand and competition for key ports and destinations existing capacity constraints constraints related to the size of certain ships security financial limitations on port development exclusivity arrangements that ports may have with our competitors geopolitical developments and local governmental regulations in light of the covid19 pandemic port availability could also be subject to immediate change depending on local andor onboard disease cases or other government restrictions as well as to limited availability during the resumption of operations higher fuel costs also may adversely impact the destinations on certain of our itineraries as they become too costly to include 

in addition certain ports and destinations have faced a surge of both cruise and noncruise tourism which in certain cases has fueled antitourism sentiments and related countermeasures to limit the volume of tourists allowed in these destinations in certain destinations countermeasures to limit the volume of tourists have been contemplated andor put into effect including proposed limits on cruise ships and cruise passengers potential restrictions in ports and destinations such as venice barcelona or key west could limit the itinerary and destination options we can offer our passengers going forward 

increased demand and competition for key ports of call or destinations limitations on the availability or feasibility of use of specific ports of call andor constraints on the availability of shore excursions and other service providers at such ports or destinations could adversely affect our operations and financial results 

we may lose business to competitors throughout the vacation market 

we operate in the vacation market and cruising is one of many alternatives for people choosing a vacation we therefore risk losing business not only to other cruise lines but also to other vacation operators which provide other leisure options including hotels resorts internetbased alternative lodging sites and package holidays and tours 

we face significant competition from other cruise lines on the basis of cruise pricing travel advisor preference and also in terms of the nature of ships services and destinations that we offer to guests our principal competitors within the cruise vacation industry include carnival corporation  plc which owns among others aida cruises carnival cruise line costa cruises cunard line holland america line po cruises princess cruises and seabourn disney cruise line msc cruises and norwegian cruise line holdings ltd which owns norwegian cruise line oceania cruises and regent seven seas cruises our revenues are sensitive to the actions of other cruise lines in many areas including pricing scheduling capacity and promotions which can have a substantial adverse impact not only on our revenues but also on overall industry revenues 

in the event that we do not effectively market or differentiate our cruise brands from our competitors or otherwise compete effectively with other vacation alternatives and new or existing cruise companies our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

if we are unable to appropriately balance our cost management and capital allocation strategies with our goal of satisfying guest expectations it may adversely impact our business success 

our goals are to provide high quality products and deliver high quality services there can be no assurance that we can successfully balance these goals with our cost management and capital allocation strategies our business also requires us to make capital allocation decisions across a broad scope of investment options with varying return profiles and time horizons for value realization these include significant capital investment decisions such as ordering new ships upgrading our existing fleet enhancing our technology andor data capabilities and expanding our portfolio of landbased assets based on expected market preferences competition and projected demand there can be no assurance that our strategies will be successful which could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations for example our ownership and operation of older tonnage in particular during the business disruption caused by covid19 has resulted in impaired asset values due to expected returns that we will not be able to recover 

our attempts to expand our business into new markets and new ventures may not be successful 

we opportunistically seek to grow our business through among other things expansion into new destinations or source markets and establishment of new ventures complementary to our current offerings these attempts to expand our business increase the complexity of our business require significant levels of investment and can strain our management personnel operations and systems in addition we have been unable to execute our attempts to expand our business as a result of the impacts of the covid19 pandemic as described elsewhere herein there can be no assurance that these business expansion efforts will develop as anticipated or that we will succeed and if we do not we may be unable to recover our investment which could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks associated with our development and operation of key landbased destination projects may adversely impact our business or results of operations 

we have invested either directly or indirectly through joint ventures and partnerships in a growing portfolio of key landbased projects including port and terminal facilities private destinations and multibrand destination projects these investments can increase our exposure to certain key risks depending on the scope location and the ownership and management structure of these projects these risks include susceptibility to weather events exposure to local politicalregulatory developments and policies logistical challenges and human resource and labor risks and safety environmental and health risks including challenges posed by the covid19 pandemic and its effects locally where we have these projects and relationships 

our reliance on travel advisors to sell and market our cruises exposes us to certain risks which could adversely impact our business 

we rely on travel advisors to generate bookings for our ships accordingly we must maintain competitive commission rates and incentive structures if we fail to offer competitive compensation packages or fail to maintain our relationships these agencies may be incentivized to sell cruises offered by our competitors which could adversely impact our operating results our reliance on thirdparty sellers is particularly pronounced in certain markets in addition the travel advisor community is sensitive to economic conditions that impact discretionary income of consumers significant disruptions such as those caused by the covid19 pandemic or contractions in the industry could reduce the number of travel advisors available for us to market and sell our cruises which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations additionally the strength of our recovery from suspended operations could be delayed if we are not aligned and partnered with key travel advisors 

business activities that involve our coinvestments with third parties may subject us to additional risks 

partnerships joint ventures and other business structures involving our coinvestments with third parties generally include some form of shared control over the operations of the business and create additional risks including the possibility that other investors in such ventures become bankrupt or otherwise lack the financial resources to meet their obligations or could have or develop business interests policies or objectives that are inconsistent with ours in addition to financial risks our coinvestment activities have also presented managerial and operational risks and expose us to reputational or legal concerns these or other issues related to our coinvestments with third parties could adversely impact our operations or liquidity due to the covid19 pandemic pullmantur sa filed for reorganization under the terms of the spanish insolvency laws the company may be required to continue to provide funding for these affiliated entities and it is unclear when and to what extent these entities will fully resume operations and our ability to provide such funding will be limited by the level and terms of our outstanding indebtedness further due to the arrangements we have in place with our partners in these ventures we are limited in our ability to control the strategy of these ventures if and when they resume operations or their use of capital and other key factors to their results of operation which could adversely affect our investments and impact our results of operations 

past or pending business acquisitions or potential acquisitions that we may decide to pursue in the future carry inherent risks which could adversely impact our financial performance and condition 

the company from time to time has engaged in acquisitions and may pursue acquisitions in the future which are subject to among other factors the company’s ability to identify attractive business opportunities and to negotiate favorable terms for such opportunities accordingly the company cannot make any assurances that potential acquisitions will be completed timely or at all or that if completed we would realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions acquisitions also carry inherent risks such as among others i the potential delay or failure of our efforts to successfully integrate business processes and realizing expected synergies ii difficulty in aligning procedures controls andor policies and iii future unknown liabilities and costs that may be associated with an acquisition in addition acquisitions may adversely impact our liquidity andor debt levels and the recognized value of goodwill and other intangible assets can be negatively affected by unforeseen events andor circumstances which may result in an impairment charge any of the foregoing events could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on supply chain vendors and thirdparty service providers who are integral to the operations of our businesses these vendors and service providers are also affected by covid19 and may be unable or unwilling to deliver on their commitments or may act in ways that could harm our business 

we rely on supply chain vendors to deliver key products to the operations of our businesses around the world any event impacting a vendor’s ability to deliver goods of the expected quality at the location and time needed could negatively impact our ability to deliver our cruise experience events impacting our supply chain could be caused by factors beyond the control of our suppliers or us including inclement weather natural disasters new laws and regulations labor actions increased demand problems in production or distribution andor disruptions in thirdparty logistics or transportation systems including those caused by the covid19 pandemic any such interruptions to our supply chain could increase our costs and could limit the availability of products critical to our operations 

in order to achieve cost and operational efficiencies we outsource to thirdparty vendors certain services that are integral to the operations of our global businesses such as our onboard concessionaires certain of our call center operations guest port services logistics distribution and operation of a large part of our information technology systems all of which are also affected by the covid19 pandemic we are subject to the risk that certain decisions are subject to the control of our thirdparty service providers and that these decisions may adversely affect our activities a failure to adequately monitor a thirdparty service provider’s compliance with a service level agreement or regulatory or legal requirements could result in significant economic and reputational harm to us there is also a risk the confidentiality privacy andor security of data held by third parties or communicated over thirdparty networks or platforms could become compromised 

the potential unavailability of insurance coverage an inability to obtain insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates or our failure to have coverage in sufficient amounts to cover our incurred losses may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

we seek to maintain appropriate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates we normally obtain insurance based on the cost of an asset rather than replacement value and we also elect to selfinsure coinsure or use deductibles in certain circumstances for certain risks such as loss of use of a ship or other business interruption the limits of insurance coverage we purchase are based on the availability of the coverage evaluation of our risk profile and cost of coverage we do not carry business interruption insurance and accordingly we have no insurance coverage for loss of revenues or earnings from our ships or other operations accordingly we are not protected against all risks and cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred which could result in an unexpected decrease in our revenue and results of operations in the event of an incident 

we are members of four protection and indemnity “pi” clubs which are part of a worldwide group of 13 pi clubs known as the international group of pi clubs the “ig” pi coverage provided by the clubs is on a mutual basis and we are subject to additional premium calls in the event of a catastrophic loss incurred by any member of the 13 pi clubs whereby the reinsurance limits purchased by the ig are exhausted we are also subject to additional premium calls based on investment and underwriting shortfalls experienced by our own individual insurers certain liabilities costs and expenses associated with covid19 cases identified on or traced to our vessels are eligible for insurance coverage under our participation in these pi clubs 

we cannot be certain that insurance and reinsurance coverage will be available to us and at commercially reasonable rates in the future or at all or if available that it will be sufficient to cover potential claims additionally if we or other insureds sustain significant losses the result may be higher insurance premiums cancellation of coverage or the inability to obtain coverage the covid19 pandemic for example depending on its duration and the associated insurance claims volumes may potentially impact the insurance markets we rely on for coverage and could adversely impact both the coverage options available to us in the future as well as the premium costs we are required to pay for those coverages such events could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

disruptions in our shoreside or shipboard operations or our information systems may adversely affect our results of operations 

our principal executive office and principal shoreside operations are located in florida and we have shoreside offices throughout the world actual or threatened natural disasters eg hurricanestyphoons earthquakes tornadoes fires or floods municipal lockdowns curfews quarantines or similar events in these locations may have a material impact on our business continuity reputation and results of operations in addition substantial or repeated information system failures computer viruses or cyber attacks impacting our shoreside or shipboard operations could adversely impact our business we do not generally carry business interruption insurance for our shoreside or shipboard operations or our information systems as such any losses or damages incurred by us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

provisions of our articles of incorporation bylaws and liberian law could inhibit a change of control and may prevent efforts by our shareholders to change our management 

certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and liberian law may inhibit third parties from effectuating a change of control of the company without approval from our board of directors which could result in the entrenchment of current management these include provisions in our articles of incorporation that prevent third parties other than a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates and their permitted transferees from acquiring beneficial ownership of more than 49 of our outstanding shares without the consent of our board of directors 

compliance and regulatory risks 

changes in us or other countries’ foreign travel policy have affected and may continue to affect our results of operations 

changes in us foreign policy have in the past and could in the future result in the imposition of travel restrictions or travel bans on us persons to certain countries or result in the imposition of travel advisories warnings rules regulations or legislation exposing us to penalties or claims of monetary damages in addition some countries have adopted restrictions against us travelers and we currently cannot predict when those restrictions will be eased the timing and scope of these changes and regulations can be unpredictable and they could cause us to cancel scheduled sailings possibly on short notice or could result in litigation against us this in turn could decrease our revenue increase our operating costs and otherwise impair our profitability 

environmental labor health and safety financial responsibility and other maritime regulations and measures could affect operations and increase operating costs 

the us and various state and foreign government or regulatory agencies have enacted or may enact environmental regulations or policies such as requiring the use of low sulfur fuels eg imo 2020 that could increase our direct cost to operate in certain markets increase our cost of fuel limit the supply of compliant fuel cause us to incur significant expenses to purchase andor develop new equipment and adversely impact the cruise vacation industry while we have taken and expect to continue to take a number of actions to mitigate the potential impact of certain of these regulations there can be no assurances that these efforts will be successful over the long term 

there is increasing global regulatory focus on climate change greenhouse gas and other emissions these regulatory efforts both internationally and in the us are still developing and we cannot yet determine what the final regulatory programs or their impact will be however such climate changerelated regulatory activity in the future may adversely affect our business and financial results by requiring us to reduce our emissions purchase allowances or otherwise pay for our emissions and may increase our exposure if any to climate changerelated litigation such activity may also impact us by increasing our operating costs including fuel costs 

in addition we are subject to various international national state and local laws regulations and treaties that govern among other things discharge from our ships safety standards applicable to our ships treatment of disabled persons health and sanitary standards applicable to our guests security standards on board our ships and at the shipport interface areas and financial responsibilities to our guests these issues are and we believe will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world this could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise ships that could subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future and may increase our exposure if any to environmentalrelated litigation 

some environmental groups also have generated negative publicity about the environmental impact of the cruise vacation industry and are advocating for more stringent regulation of ship emissions at berth and at sea growing environmental scrutiny of the cruise industry and any related measures could adversely impact our operations and financial results and subject us to reputational impacts and costs 

a change in our tax status under the us internal revenue code or other jurisdictions may have adverse effects on our results of operations 

royal caribbean cruises ltd and a number of our subsidiaries are foreign corporations that derive income from a us trade or business andor from sources within the us in connection with the year end audit each year faegre drinker biddle  reath llp our us tax counsel delivers to us an opinion based on certain representations and assumptions set forth in it to the effect that this income to the extent derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships is excluded from gross income for us federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 883 of the internal revenue code we believe that most of our income including that of our subsidiaries is derived from or incidental to the international operation of ships 

our ability to rely on section 883 could be challenged or could change in the future provisions of the internal revenue code including section 883 are subject to legislative change at any time moreover changes could occur in the future with respect to the identity residence or holdings of our direct or indirect shareholders trading volume or trading frequency of our shares or relevant foreign tax laws of liberia or the bahamas such that they no longer qualify as equivalent exemption jurisdictions that could affect our eligibility for the section 883 exemption accordingly there can be no assurance that we will continue to be exempt from us income tax on us source shipping income in the future if we were not entitled to the benefit of section 883 we and our subsidiaries would be subject to us taxation on a portion of the income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships which would reduce our net income 

additionally portions of our business are operated by companies that are within the united kingdom tonnage tax regime further some of our operations are conducted in jurisdictions where we rely on tax treaties to provide exemption from taxation to the extent the united kingdom tonnage tax laws change or we do not continue to meet the applicable qualification requirements or if tax treaties are changed or revoked we may be required to pay higher income tax in these jurisdictions adversely impacting our results of operations 

as budgetary constraints continue to adversely impact the jurisdictions in which we operate increases in income tax regulations tax audits or tax reform affecting our operations may be imposed 

we are not a us corporation and as a result our shareholders may be subject to the uncertainties of a foreign legal system in protecting their interests 

our corporate affairs are governed by our articles of incorporation and bylaws and by the business corporation act of liberia the provisions of the business corporation act of liberia resemble provisions of the corporation laws of a number of states in the us however there are very few judicial cases in liberia interpreting the business corporation act of liberia while the business corporation act of liberia provides that it is to be applied and construed to make the laws of liberia with respect of the subject matter of the business corporation act of liberia uniform with the laws of the state of delaware and other states with substantially similar legislative provisions and adopts their case law to the extent it is nonconflicting there have been few liberian court cases interpreting the business corporation act of liberia and we cannot predict whether liberian courts would reach the same conclusions as united states courts we understand that legislation has been proposed but not yet adopted by the liberian legislature which amends the provisions regarding the adoption of nonliberian law to among other things provide for the adoption of the statutory and case law of delaware and not also states with substantially similar legislative provisions and potentially provide the courts of liberia discretion in application of nonstatutory corporation law of delaware in cases when the laws of liberia are silent the right of shareholders to bring a derivative action in liberian courts may be more limited than in us jurisdictions there may also be practical difficulties for shareholders attempting to bring suit in liberia and liberian courts may or may not recognize and enforce foreign judgments thus our shareholders may have more difficulty challenging actions taken by management directors or controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a us jurisdiction 

general risk factors 

conducting business globally may result in increased costs and other risks 

we operate our business globally which exposes us to a number of risks including increased exposure to a wider range of regional and local economic conditions volatile local political conditions potential changes in duties and taxes including changing andor uncertain interpretations of existing tax laws and regulations required compliance with additional laws and policies affecting cruising vacation or maritime businesses or governing the operations of foreignbased companies currency fluctuations interest rate movements difficulties in operating under local business environments port quality and availability in certain regions us and global antibribery laws and regulations imposition of trade barriers and restrictions on repatriation of earnings 

our future growth strategies increasingly depend on the growth and sustained profitability of international markets factors that will be critical to our success in these markets include our ability to continue to raise awareness of our products and our ability to adapt our offerings to best suit rapidly evolving consumer demands this risk is further heightened by the covid19 pandemic as authorities in many of these markets have implemented numerous measures to contain the spread and impact of covid19 such as travel bans and restrictions shelterinplacestayathome orders and other limitations on business activity including business closures in addition these measures could change unpredictably andor could be scaled up or down in response to evolving intensity or resurgence of covid19 and related variants in or around these markets the execution of our planned growth strategies is 

dependent on meeting the governmental and regulatory measures and policies in each of these markets our ability to realize our future growth strategy is highly dependent on our ability to satisfy countryspecific policies and requirements in order to return to service as well as meet the needs of regionspecific consumer preferences as services come back online these factors may cause us to reevaluate some of our international business strategies 

operating globally also exposes us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal regulatory and tax requirements in many parts of the world including countries in which we operate practices in the local business communities might not conform to international business standards these legal and regulatory requirements and standards may change in response to the covid19 pandemic and there may be greater uncertainty as to the interpretation and enforcement of applicable laws and regulations including those introduced in response to the covid19 pandemic we cannot guarantee consistent interpretation application and enforcement of rules and regulations put in place in response to the covid19 pandemic which could place limits on our operations or increase our costs as well as negatively impact our future growth strategies in our key growth markets we must adhere to policies designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance as well as applicable laws and regulations however we might not be successful in ensuring that our employees agents representatives and other third parties with whom we associate properly adhere to applicable laws and regulations in addition we may be exposed to the risk of penalties and other liabilities if we fail to comply with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements introduced in response to the covid19 pandemic which may be subject to frequent and rapid change failure by us our employees or any of these third parties to adhere to our policies or applicable laws or regulations could result in penalties sanctions damage to our reputation and related costs which in turn could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows 

as a global operator our business also may be impacted by changes in us policy or priorities in areas such as trade immigration including any continuation of any of the immigration policies put in place by the us government in response to the covid19 pandemic andor environmental or labor regulations among others depending on the nature and scope of any such changes they could impact our domestic and international business operations any such changes and any international response to them could potentially introduce new barriers to passenger or crew travel andor cross border transactions impact our guest experience andor increase our operating costs 

if we are unable to address these risks adequately our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected including impairing the value of our ships and other assets 

the terms of our existing debt financing gives and any future preferred equity or debt financing may give holders of any preferred securities or debt securities rights that are senior to rights of our common shareholders 

the holders of our existing debt have rights preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock in the event of liquidation if we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of preferred stock or convertible securities the terms of the debt or the preferred stock issued may give the holders rights preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock particularly in the event of liquidation if we raise funds through the issuance of additional equity the ownership percentage of our existing shareholders would be diluted 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates fuel prices and interest rates could affect our financial results 

we are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates fuel prices and interest rates significant changes in any of the foregoing could have a material impact on our financial results net of the impact of our hedging activities and natural offsets our operating results have been and will continue to be impacted often significantly by changes in each of these factors 

a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates that are linked to changing market interest rates as a result an increase in market interest rates would increase our interest expense and our debt service obligations as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 74 billion of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates this amount represented approximately 343 of our total indebtedness as of december 31 2021 a hypothetical 1 increase in prevailing interest rates would increase our forecasted 2022 interest expense by approximately 487 million 

additionally the value of our earnings in foreign currencies is adversely impacted by a strong us dollar in addition any significant increase in fuel prices could materially and adversely affect our business as fuel prices impact not only our fuel costs but also some of our other expenses such as crew travel freight and commodity prices mandatory fuel restrictions may also create uncertainty related to the price and availability of certain fuel types potentially impacting operating costs and the value of our related hedging instruments 

the loss of key personnel our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel or disruptions among our shipboard personnel could adversely affect our results of operations 

our success depends in large part on the skills and contributions of key executives and other employees and on our ability to recruit develop and retain high quality personnel as well as having adequate succession plans and backup operating plans for when critical executives are unable to serve as demand for qualified personnel in the industry grows we must continue to effectively recruit train motivate and retain our employees both shoreside and on our ships in order to effectively compete in our industry maintain our current business and support our projected global growth 

we are experiencing difficulty in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel as a result of covid19 the reduction in our workforce during our suspension of cruise operations general macroeconomic conditions and a competitive labor market our ability to rehire crew may be negatively impacted by increasing demands related to our health and safety protocols including vaccine requirements and by a reduced labor supply as previous crew may have obtained alternative employment during our suspension of cruise operations a prolonged shortage of qualified personnel andor increased turnover could decrease our ability to operate our business in an optimal manner the shortage and competitive labor market may result in increased costs if we need to hire temporary personnel andor increased wages andor benefits in order to attract and retain employees all of which may negatively impact our results of operations 

as of december 31 2021 approximately 86 of our shipboard employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements a dispute under our collective bargaining agreements could result in a work stoppage of those employees covered by the agreements we may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate these collective bargaining agreements when they expire in addition existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage on our ships we may also be subject to or affected by work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements any such work stoppages or potential work stoppages could have a material adverse effect on our financial results as could a loss of key employees our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel or disruptions among our personnel 

if we are unable to keep pace with developments in technology including technology in response to the covid19 pandemic our operations or competitive position could become impaired 

our business continues to demand the use of sophisticated technology and systems these technologies and systems require significant investment and must be proven refined updated upgraded andor replaced with more advanced systems in order to continue to meet our customers’ demands and expectations if we are unable to do so in a timely manner or within reasonable cost parameters or if we are unable to appropriately and timely train our employees to operate any of these new systems our business could suffer we also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new technology or system which could result in higher than anticipated costs or impair our operating results 

in response to covid19 we have relied on technology to assist with mitigating the risk of covid19 for our passengers and crew for example we have deployed our patented emuster technology across our fleet in an effort to minimize congregate settings onboard additionally on certain vessels we have deployed our patented contact tracing technology in an effort to quickly identify close contacts of cases onboard as this technology continues to develop we may be faced with technical constraints or development decisions we may be unable to obtain appropriate technology in a timely manner or at all or we may incur significant costs in doing so a failure to adopt the appropriate technology or a failure or obsolescence in the technology that we do adopt could adversely affect our results of operations 

we are exposed to cyber security attacks and data breaches and the risks and costs associated with protecting our systems and maintaining data integrity and security 

we are subject to cyber security attacks these cyber attacks can vary in scope and intent from attacks with the objective of compromising our systems networks and communications for economic gain or with the objective of disrupting disabling or otherwise compromising our maritime andor shoreside operations the attacks can encompass a wide range of methods and intent including phishing attacks illegitimate requests for payment theft of intellectual property theft of confidential or nonpublic information installation of malware installation of ransomware and theft of personal or business information the frequency and sophistication of and methods used to conduct these attacks have increased over time 

a successful cyber security attack may target us directly or it may be the result of a third party’s inadequate care or resulting from vulnerabilities in licensed software in either scenario the company may suffer damage to its systems and data that could interrupt our operations adversely impact our brand reputation and expose us to increased risks of governmental investigation litigation fines and other liability any of which could adversely affect our business furthermore responding to such an attack and mitigating the risk of future attacks could result in additional operating and capital costs in technology personnel monitoring and other investments 

we are also subject to various risks associated with the collection handling storage and transmission of sensitive information in the regular course of business we collect employee customer and other thirdparty data including personally identifiable information and individual payment data for various business purposes although we have policies and procedures in place to safeguard such sensitive information this information has been and could be subject to cyber security attacks and the aforementioned 

risks in addition we are subject to federal state and international laws relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of personally identifiable information and individual payment data those laws include among others the european union general data protection regulation and regulations of the new york state department of financial services and similar state agencies that impose additional cyber security requirements as a result of our provision of certain insurance products complying with these and other applicable laws has caused and may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices and our failure to do so may expose us to substantial fines penalties restrictions litigation or other expenses and adversely affect our business further any changes to laws or regulations including new restrictions or requirements applicable to our business or an increase in enforcement of existing laws and regulations could expose us to additional costs and liability and could limit our use and disclosure of such information 

while we continue to evolve our cyber security practices in line with our business’ reliance on technology and the changing external threat landscape and we invest time effort and financial resources to secure our systems networks and communications our security measures cannot provide absolute assurance that we will be successful in preventing or defending from all cyber security attacks impacting our operation there can be no assurance that any breach or incident will not have a material impact on our operations and financial results 

any breach theft loss or fraudulent use of guest employee thirdparty or company data could adversely impact our reputation and brand and our ability to retain or attract new customers and expose us to risks of data loss business disruption governmental investigation litigation and other liability any of which could adversely affect our business significant capital investments and other expenditures could be required to remedy the problem and prevent future breaches including costs associated with additional security technologies personnel experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached further if we or our vendors experience significant data security breaches or fail to detect and appropriately respond to significant data security breaches we could be exposed to government enforcement actions and private litigation 

litigation enforcement actions fines or penalties could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations andor damage our reputation 

our business is subject to various us and international laws and regulations that could lead to enforcement actions fines civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims and damages in addition improper conduct by our employees agents or joint venture partners could damage our reputation andor lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties including substantial monetary fines in certain circumstances it may not be economical to defend against such matters andor our legal strategy may not ultimately result in us prevailing in a matter such events could lead to an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations in addition we have experienced and may continue to experience increases in litigation pertaining to the covid19 crisis including potential claims for nonrefundable cash deposits we cannot predict the quantum or outcome of any such proceedings and the impact that they will have on our financial results but any such impact may be material while some of these claims are covered by insurance we cannot be certain that all of them will be which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations

 item 3 legal proceedings 

as previously reported two lawsuits were filed against us in august 2019 in the us district court for the southern district of florida the court under title iii of the cuban liberty and democratic solidarity act also known as the helmsburton act the complaint filed by havana docks corporation havana docks action alleges it holds an interest in the havana cruise port terminal and the complaint filed by javier garciabengochea the port of santiago action alleges that he holds an interest in the port of santiago cuba both of which were expropriated by the cuban government the complaints further allege that we trafficked in those properties by embarking and disembarking passengers at these facilities the plaintiffs seek all available statutory remedies including the value of the expropriated property plus interest treble damages attorneys’ fees and costs in the havana docks action we and the plaintiff have filed motions for summary judgment which were heard by the court in january 2022 the havana docks action is scheduled for trial on may 23 2022 the court dismissed the port of santiago action with prejudice on the basis that the plaintiff lacked standing and the plaintiff’s appeal of the dismissal is awaiting a decision by the appellate court we believe we have meritorious defenses to the claims alleged in both the havana docks action and the port of santiago action and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against them the outcome of litigation is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties and there can be no assurances that the final outcome of either case will not be material 

we are also routinely involved in claims typical within the travel and tourism vacation industry the majority of these claims are covered by insurance we believe the outcome of such claims net of expected insurance recoveries will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations and cash flows

• a discussion of our liquidity and capital resources including our future capital and contractual commitments and potential funding sources 

a discussion of our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the year ended december 31 2019 is included in part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of our annual report on form 10 k for the year ended december 31 2020  f iled with the sec on february 26 2021 and is incorporated by reference into this form 10k 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap refer to note 1  general and note 2  summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  certain of our accounting policies are deemed critical as they require managements highest degree of judgment estimates and assumptions we have discussed these accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors we believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates are as follows 

liquidity and covid19 

the effects of covid19 have had and continue to have a material negative impact on our operations financial results and liquidity the full extent of the impact will be determined by the length of time covid19 influences our industry and our gradual return to service given the ongoing effects of covid19 on our operations and global bookings we have identified the estimation of our future liquidity requirements as a critical accounting policy 

• expected continued gradual resumption of cruise operations 

• expected sustained increase in revenue per available passenger cruise day during our continued resumption of cruise operations 

• expected lower than comparable historical occupancy levels during our continued resumption of cruise operations increasing over time until we reach historical occupancy levels and 

• expected spend during our continued resumption of cruise operations including returning our crew members to our vessels and maintaining enhanced health and safety protocols 

the assumptions used to estimate our liquidity requirements are frequently and continuously evaluated because of the unprecedented environment that we are experiencing due to covid19 in addition the magnitude duration and speed of the global pandemic continues to be uncertain as a result we have made reasonable estimates and judgments of the impact of covid19 on our liquidity within our financial statements and there may be changes to those estimates in future periods 

we have taken and will continue to take actions to improve our liquidity including 

• reduction of capital expenditures 

• reduction of operating expenses in 2020 and 2021 during the suspension of our global cruise operations including furloughing staff and laying up vessels 

• amending credit agreements to defer payments and covenant requirements as well as extend maturity dates 

• raising capital through debt and stock issuances and 

• suspending dividend payments 

ship accounting 

ships represent our most significant assets and are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization depreciation of ships is generally computed net of a 1015 projected residual value using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of the asset which is generally 3035 years the 3035 year useful life and 1015 residual value is the weightedaverage of all major components of a ship our useful life and residual value estimates take into consideration the impact of anticipated technological changes longterm cruise and vacation market conditions and historical useful lives of similarlybuilt ships in addition we take into consideration our estimates of the weightedaverage useful lives of the ships major component systems such as hull superstructure main electric engines and cabins we employ a cost allocation methodology at the component level in order to support the estimated weightedaverage useful lives and residual values as well as to determine the net cost basis of assets being replaced given the very large and complex nature of our ships our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain we do not have cost segregation studies performed to specifically componentize our ship systems however we estimate the costs useful lives and residual values of component systems based principally on general and technical information known about major ship component systems and their lives as well as our knowledge of the cruise vacation industry we do not identify and track depreciation by ship component systems but instead utilize these estimates to determine the net cost basis of assets replaced or refurbished improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized as additions to the ship and depreciated over the shorter of the improvements estimated useful lives or that 

of the associated ship the estimated cost and accumulated depreciation of replaced or refurbished ship components are written off and any resulting losses are recognized within cruise operating expenses in our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss 

we periodically review estimated useful lives and residual values for ongoing reasonableness considering long term views on our intended use of each class of ships and the planned level of improvements to maintain and enhance vessels within those classes in the event a factor is identified that may trigger a change in the estimated useful lives and residual values of our ships a review of the estimate is completed 

we use the deferral method to account for drydocking costs under the deferral method drydocking costs incurred are deferred and charged to expense on a straightline basis over the period to the next scheduled drydock which we estimate to be a period of thirty to sixty months based on the vessels age as required by class deferred drydock costs consist of the costs to drydock the vessel and other costs incurred in connection with the drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessels class certification class certification is necessary in order for our cruise ships to be flagged in a specific country obtain liability insurance and legally operate as passenger cruise ships the activities associated with those drydocking costs cannot be performed while the vessel is in service and as such are done during a drydock as a planned major maintenance activity the significant deferred drydock costs consist of hauling and wharfage services provided by the drydock facility hull inspection and related activities eg scraping pressure cleaning bottom painting maintenance to steering propulsion thruster equipment and ballast tanks port services such as tugs pilotage and line handling and freight associated with these items we perform a detailed analysis of the various activities performed for each drydock and only defer those costs that are directly related to planned major maintenance activities necessary to maintain class the costs deferred are related to activities not otherwise routinely periodically performed to maintain a vessels designed and intended operating capability repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred 

we use judgment when estimating the period between drydocks which can result in adjustments to the estimated amortization of drydock costs if the vessel is disposed of before the next drydock the remaining balance in deferred drydock is writtenoff to the gain or loss on disposal of vessel in the period in which the sale takes place we also use judgment when identifying costs incurred during a drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessels class certification as compared to those costs attributable to repairs and maintenance which are expensed as incurred 

we believe we have made reasonable estimates for ship accounting purposes however should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimates of ship useful lives or projected residual values depreciation expense could be materially higher or lower if circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making determinations as to whether ship improvements should be capitalized the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance costs could increase partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense if we had reduced our estimated average ship useful life by one year depreciation expense for 2021 would have increased by approximately 480 million if our ships were estimated to have no residual value depreciation expense for 2021 would have increased by approximately 2617 million we have evaluated our estimated ship useful lives and projected residual values in light of our current environment and determined that there are no changes to these estimates based on our gradual return to service 

business combinations 

on july 31 2018 we acquired a 667 equity stake the 2018 acquisition in silversea cruises previously known as silversea cruises holding ltd an ultraluxury and expedition cruise line from heritage cruise holding ltd heritage previously known as silversea cruises group ltd the purchase price for the 2018 acquisition consisted of 102 billion in cash net of assumed liabilities and contingent consideration due to heritage the fair value of the contingent consideration at the time of the 2018 acquisition was 440 million changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration were recorded in our results of operations if any in the period of the change prior to its termination 

on july 9 2020 we acquired the remaining 333 interest in silversea cruises that we did not already own the noncontrolling interest from heritage as a result of the acquisition of the noncontrolling interest silversea cruises is now a wholly owned cruise brand refer to note 1 general to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further information regarding acquisition of silversea cruises noncontrolling interest 

we account for business combinations in accordance with asc 805 business combinations  by applying the acquisition method of accounting the acquisition method of accounting requires that we record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the noncontrolling interest if any at their respective fair values at the acquisition date goodwill is recognized as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired significant estimates and assumptions are made by management to value such assets and liabilities based on third party valuations such as appraisals or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques although we believe that those estimates and assumptions are 

reasonable and appropriate they are inherently uncertain and subject to change if during the measurement period not to exceed one year additional information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date related to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed we may adjust our estimates to account for subsequent adjustments to the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date resulting in an offsetting adjustment to the goodwill associated with the business acquired our purchase price measurement period for the silversea cruises 2018 acquisition was closed during 2019 

uncertain tax positions and taxrelated valuation allowances are initially established in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date additionally any contingent consideration is estimated at fair value at the acquisition date liabilityclassified contingent consideration is remeasured each reporting period with changes in fair value recognized in earnings until the contingent consideration is settled 

valuation of goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets and longlived assets 

we review goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or when events or circumstances dictate more frequently the impairment review for goodwill consists of a qualitative assessment of whether it is morelikely thannot that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying value and if necessary a goodwill impairment test factors to consider when performing the qualitative assessment include general economic conditions limitations on accessing capital changes in forecasted operating results changes in fuel prices and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 

the goodwill impairment analysis consists of a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value we typically estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model which may also include a combination of a marketbased valuation approach the estimation of fair value utilizing discounted expected future cash flows includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of expected revenues operating costs marketing selling and administrative expenses interest rates ship additions and retirements as well as assumptions regarding the cruise vacation industrys competitive environment and general economic and business conditions among other factors the principal assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model for our 2021 impairment assessments were 

• forecasted net revenues primarily the timing of returning to normalized operations occupancy rates from existing and expected ship deliveries and terminal growth rate and 

• weighted average cost of capital ie discount rate 

the discounted cash flow model uses the most current projected operating results for the upcoming fiscal year as a base we discount the projected cash flows using rates specific to the reporting unit based on its weightedaverage cost of capital 

if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value no writedown of goodwill is required as amended by asu no 201704 intangibles  goodwill and other topic 350 – simplifying the test for goodwill impairment  if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of its net assets an impairment is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to such reporting unit 

the impairment review for indefinitelife intangible assets can be performed using a qualitative or quantitative impairment assessment the quantitative assessment consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying value we estimate the fair value of these assets using a discounted cash flow model and various valuation methods depending on the nature of the intangible asset such as the relieffromroyalty method for trademarks and trade names the principal assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model for our 2021 impairment assessments were 

• forecasted net revenues primarily the timing of returning to normalized operations occupancy rates from existing and expected ship deliveries and terminal growth rate 

• royalty rate and 

• weighted average cost of capital ie discount rate 

if the carrying value exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess if the fair value exceeds its carrying value the indefinitelife intangible asset is not considered impaired other intangible assets assigned finite useful lives are amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives refer to note 5 intangible assets to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplemental data for further information on indefinitelife intangible assets 

we review our ships and other longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate based on recent and projected cash flow performance and remaining useful lives that the carrying value of these assets may not be fully recoverable we evaluate asset impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities the lowest level for which we maintain identifiable cash flows that are independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities is at the ship level for our ships if estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of an asset an impairment charge is recognized to the extent its carrying value exceeds fair value refer to note 6  property and equipment to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplemental data for further information on determination of fair value for longlived assets 

we estimate fair value based on quoted market prices in active markets if available if active markets are not available we base fair value on independent appraisals sales price negotiations and projected future cash flows discounted at a rate estimated by management to be commensurate with the business risk quoted market prices are often not available for individual reporting units and for indefinitelife intangible assets accordingly we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit and an indefinitelife intangible asset using an expected present value technique 

as a result of our voluntary suspension of global cruise operations effective march 2020 in response to the covid19 outbreak and our gradual resumption of cruise operations during 2021 we performed interim impairment evaluations in addition to our annual impairment reviews of certain of our goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets and longlived assets in connection with the preparation of our 2021 and 2020 quarterly and annual financial statements as further discussed below 

royal caribbean international reporting unit 

we performed interim impairment evaluations of royal caribbean international’s goodwill in connection with the preparation of our quarterly financial statements for the periods ended march 31 2020 and june 30 2020 due to the significant impact that covid19 had on our projected cash flows and triggering events identified in those quartersthe fair value of the royal caribbean international reporting unit as of march 31 2020 was determined using a probabilityweighted discounted cash flow model and for june 30 2020 we used a probabilityweighted discounted cash flow model in combination with a marketbased valuation approach as a result of the tests we determined that the fair value of the royal caribbean international reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 30 and 8 as of march 31 2020 and june 30 2020 respectively resulting in no impairment to the royal caribbean international goodwill in those periods we did not perform an interim impairment evaluation of royal caribbean internationals goodwill subsequent to the quarter ended june 30 2020 during 2020 or 2021 as no triggering events were identified 

during the fourth quarters of 2021 and 2020 we performed our annual impairment review of goodwill for royal caribbean internationals reporting unit we did not perform qualitative assessments but instead proceeded directly to the goodwill impairment tests as of november 30 2021 the fair value of the royal caribbean international reporting unit was determined using a discounted cash flow model in combination with a marketbased valuation approach as november 30 2020 we used a probabilityweighted discounted cash flow model in combination with a marketbased valuation approach as a result of the tests we determined the fair value of the royal caribbean international reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 38 and 14 as of november 30 2021 and 2020 respectively resulting in no impairment to royal caribbean internationals goodwill the carrying value of goodwill attributable to our royal caribbean reporting unit was 2965 million and 2966 million as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

silversea cruises reporting unit 

we performed interim impairment evaluations of silversea cruises’ goodwill and trade name in connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the quarter ended march 31 2020 as a result of these analyses we determined that the carrying value of the silversea cruises reporting unit exceeded its fair value similarly we determined that the carrying value of silversea cruises’ trade name exceeded its fair value accordingly upon the completion of the impairment tests we recognized impairment charges of 5762 million and 308 million for goodwill and the trade name respectively during the quarter ended march 31 2020 we estimated the fair value of the silversea cruises reporting unit using a probabilityweighted discounted cash flow model in combination with a marketbased valuation approach we did not perform an interim impairment evaluation of silversea cruisess goodwill or trade names subsequent to the quarter ended march 31 2020 during 2020 or 2021 as no triggering events were identified 

during the fourth quarters of 2021 and 2020 we performed our annual impairment review of silversea cruises goodwill we did not perform qualitative assessments but instead proceeded directly to the goodwill impairment tests as of november 30 2021 the fair value of the silversea cruises reporting unit was determined using a discounted cash flow model in combination with a marketbased valuation approach as of november 30 2020 we used a probabilityweighted discounted cash flow model in combination with a marketbased valuation approach as a result of the tests we determined the fair value 

of the silversea cruises reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 35 and 12 as of november 30 2021 and 2020 respectively resulting in no impairment to silversea cruises goodwill the carrying value of goodwill attributable to our silversea cruises reporting unit was 5086 million as of december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 

during the fourth quarters of 2021 and 2020 we performed our annual impairment reviews of silversea cruises trade name as a result of the quantitative tests we determined that the fair value of the silversea cruises trade name exceeded its carrying value by approximately 19 and 3 as of november 30 2021 and november 30 2020 respectively resulting in no impairment to silversea cruises tr ade name 

as of december 31 2021 and 2020 the carrying value of indefinitelife intangible assets was 3215 million which primarily relates to the silversea cruises trade name 

longlived assets 

events surrounding the covid19 pandemic negatively impacted the expected undiscounted cash flows of certain of our longlived assets we evaluated these assets during the years ended 2021 and 2020 pursuant to our longlived asset impairment test which resulted in no impairment charges for the year ended december 31 2021 and 4642 million of impairment charges during the year ended december 31 2020 to write down certain ships operated by our global brands to their estimated fair values the amount also includes impairment charges for ships that our global brands disposed of during 2020 as well as the three azamara ships 

we also recorded impairment charges of 1713 million during the year ended december 31 2020 for the three ships that we chartered to pullmantur holdings prior to the filing of the pullmantur reorganization during the quarter ended september 30 2020 we sold the ships to third parties for amounts approximating their carrying values and no further impairment was recorded refer to note 6 property and equipment and note 7  other assets to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplemental data for further information regarding impairment of the ships and pullmanturs reorganization 

during the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 we also determined that certain construction in progress projects would be reduced in scope or would no longer be completed due to the impact covid19 has had on our operations this led to impairment charges of construction in progress assets of 516 million and 915 million during 2021 and 2020 respectively as reported in property and equipment net 

in addition during the year ended december 31 2020 we identified that the undiscounted cash flows for certain rightofuse assets were less than their carrying values due to the negative impact of covid19 we evaluated these assets pursuant to our longlived asset impairment test resulting in an impairment charge of 659 million to write down these assets to their estimated fair values during the year ended december 31 2020 for the year ended december 31 2021 there was no resulting impairment to rightofuse assets 

the combined impairment charge of 552 million for the year ended december 31 2021 related to construction in progress and other longlived assets and 15 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 primarily related to our goodwill trademarks and trade names vessels construction in progress and rightofuse assets are reported within impairment and credit losses within our consolidate d statements of comprehensive loss income these impairment assessments and the resulting charges were determined based on management’s current estimates and projections using information through the time of the issuance of these financial statements the adverse impact that covid19 will continue to have on our business operating results cash flows and overall financial condition is uncertain and may result in changes to the assumptions used in the impairment tests discussed above which may result in additional impairments of our goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets and longlived assets in the future refer to risk factors in part 1 item 1a for further discussion on risks related to the covid19 pandemic 

derivative instruments 

we enter into various forward swap and option contracts to manage our interest rate exposure and to limit our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices these instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value and the vast majority are designated as hedges we also use nonderivative financial instruments designated as hedges of our net investment in our foreign operations and investments although some of our derivative financial instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting or are not accounted for under hedge accounting we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes we account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with authoritative guidance refer to note 2  summary of significant accounting policies and note 16 fair value measurements and derivative instruments to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary 

data for more information on related authoritative guidance the companys hedging programs and derivative financial instruments 

on a regular basis we enter into foreign currency forward contracts interest rate swaps fuel swaps and options with thirdparty institutions in overthecounter markets we estimate the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps using expected future cash flows based on the instruments contract terms and published forward prices for foreign currency exchange and interest rates we value floors which are embedded within our interest rate swaps using standard option pricing models with inputs based on the options’ contract terms such as exercise price and maturity and readily available market data such as forward interest rates and interest rate volatility we apply present value techniques to convert the expected future cash flows to the current fair value of the instruments 

we estimate the fair value of our fuel swaps using expected future cash flows based on the swaps contract terms and forward prices we derive forward prices from published forward fuel curves which in turn are based on actual market transactions and published price quotes for similar assets we apply present value techniques to convert the expected future cash flows to the current fair value of the instruments we also corroborate our fair value estimates using valuations provided by our counterparties 

we adjust the valuation of our derivative financial instruments to incorporate credit risk 

we believe it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts interest rate swaps fuel swaps and options would be derived from other appropriate valuation models using similar assumptions inputs or conditions suggested by actual historical experience 

the prior suspension of our cruise operations due to the covid19 pandemic and our gradual resumption of cruise operations has resulted in reductions to our forecasted fuel purchases during the year ended december 31 2021 we discontinued cash flow hedge accounting on 02 million metric tons of our fuel swap agreements maturing in 2021 and 2022 which resulted in the reclassification of a net 07 million loss from accumulated other comprehensive loss to other income expense  during the year ended december 31 2020 we discontinued cash flow hedge accounting on 06 million metric tons of our fuel swap agreements maturing in 2020 and 2021 which resulted in the reclassification of a net 1044 million loss from accumulated other comprehensive loss to other income expense  changes in the fair value of fuel swaps for which cash flow hedge accounting was discontinued are currently recognized in other income expense each reporting period through the maturity dates of the fuel swaps 

future s uspension of our operations or modifications to our itineraries may affect our expected forecasted fuel purchases which could result in further discontinuance of fuel swap cash flow hedge accounting and the reclassification of deferred gains or losses from accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings  refer to risk factors in part 1 item 1a for further discussion on risks related to the covid19 pandemic 

contingencies—litigation 

on an ongoing basis we assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us while it is typically difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss if any can be made in assessing probable losses we take into consideration estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries if any which are recorded as assets when recoverability is probable we accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recoveries it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made 

seasonality 

our revenues are seasonal based on demand for cruises demand is strongest for cruises during the northern hemispheres summer months and holidays in order to mitigate the impact of the winter weather in the northern hemisphere and to capitalize on the summer season in the southern hemisphere our brands have focused on deployment to the caribbean asia and australia during that period 

financial presentation 

description of certain line items 

revenues 

our revenues are comprised of the following 

• passenger ticket revenues  which consist of revenue recognized from the sale of passenger tickets and the sale of air transportation to and from our ships and 

• onboard and other revenues  which consist primarily of revenues from the sale of goods andor services onboard our ships not included in passenger ticket prices cancellation fees sales of vacation protection insurance pre and postcruise tours and fees for operating certain port facilities onboard and other revenues also include revenues we receive from independent third party concessionaires that pay us a percentage of their revenues in exchange for the right to provide selected goods andor services onboard our ships as well as revenues received for our bareboat charter procurement and management related services we perform on behalf of our unconsolidated affiliates 

cruise operating expenses 

our cruise operating expenses are comprised of the following 

• commissions transportation and other expenses  which consist of those costs directly associated with passenger ticket revenues including travel advisor commissions air and other transportation expenses port costs that vary with passenger head counts and related credit card fees 

• onboard and other expenses  which consist of the direct costs associated with onboard and other revenues including the costs of products sold onboard our ships vacation protection insurance premiums costs associated with pre and postcruise tours and related credit card fees as well as the minimal costs associated with concession revenues as the costs are mostly incurred by thirdparty concessionaires and costs incurred for the procurement and management related services we perform on behalf of our unconsolidated affiliates 

• payroll and related expenses  which consist of costs for shipboard personnel costs associated with our shoreside personnel are included in marketing selling and administrative expenses  

• food expenses  which include food costs for both guests and crew 

• fuel expenses  which include fuel and related delivery storage and emission consumable costs and the financial impact of fuel swap agreements and 

• other operating expenses  which consist primarily of operating costs such as repairs and maintenance port costs that do not vary with passenger head counts vessel related insurance entertainment and gains andor losses related to the sale of our ships if any 

we do not allocate payroll and related expenses food expenses fuel expenses or other operating expenses to the expense categories attributable to passenger ticket revenues or onboard and other revenues since they are incurred to provide the total cruise vacation experience 

selected operational and financial metrics 

we utilize a variety of operational and financial metrics which are defined below to evaluate our performance and financial condition as discussed in more detail herein certain of these metrics are nongaap financial measures these nongaap financial measures are provided along with the related gaap financial measures as we believe they provide useful information to investors as a supplement to our consolidated financial statements which are prepared and presented in accordance with gaap the presentation of nongaap financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap 

adjusted loss earnings per share adjusted eps represents adjusted net loss income attributable to royal caribbean cruises ltd as defined below divided by weighted average shares outstanding or by diluted weighted average shares outstanding as applicable we believe that this nongaap measure is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis 

adjusted net loss income attributable to royal caribbean cruises ltd represents net loss income less net income attributable to noncontrolling interest excluding certain items that we believe adjusting for is meaningful when assessing our 

performance on a comparative basis for the periods presented these items included i loss on the extinguishment of debt ii the amortization of noncash debt discount on our convertible notes iii the estimated cash refund expected to be paid to pullmantur guests and other expenses incurred as part of the pullmantur sa reorganization iv impairment and credit losses recognized as a result of the impact of covid19 v equity investment asset impairments vi net insurance recoveries related to the collapse of the drydock structure at the grand bahama shipyard involving oasis of the seas or for 2019 incidental costs net of insurance recoveries related to drydock structure incidents grand bahama shipyard vii restructuring charges incurred in relation to the reduction in our us workforce and other initiative expenses and the reorganization of our international sales and marketing structure in 2019 viii the change in the fair value in the silversea cruises contingent consideration the amortization of the silversea cruises intangible assets resulting from our acquisition of a 667 interest in silversea cruises in 2018 and transaction and integration costs related to the 2018 silversea cruises acquisition ix the noncontrolling interest adjustment to exclude the impact of the contractual accretion requirements associated with the put option held by heritage cruise holding ltd previously known as silversea cruises group ltd noncontrolling interest in silversea cruises which noncontrolling interest we acquired on july 9 2020 x the net gain recognized in the first quarter of 2021 in relation to the sale of the azamara brand xi currency translation losses recognized during the second quarter of 2020 in connection with the ships classified as assets heldforsale that were previously chartered to pullmantur and xii the net loss recognized in the fourth quarter of 2021 related to the elimination of the threemonth reporting lag for silversea cruises 

available passenger cruise days  apcd  is our measurement of capacity and represents double occupancy per cabin multiplied by the number of cruise days for the period which excludes canceled cruise days and cabins not available for sale we use this measure to perform capacity and rate analysis to identify our main noncapacity drivers that cause our cruise revenue and expenses to vary 

occupancy load factor  in accordance with cruise vacation industry practice occupancy is calculated by dividing passenger cruise days as defined below by apcd a percentage in excess of 100 indicates that three or more passengers occupied some cabins 

passenger cruise days represent the number of passengers carried for the period multiplied by the number of days of their respective cruises 

although discussed in prior periods we do not disclose or reconcile in this report our gross yields net yields gross cruise costs net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel as defined in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2019 historically we have utilized these financial metrics to measure relevant rate comparisons to other periods however our 2020 and 2021 reduction in capacity and revenues and the shift in the nature of our running costs due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our operations do not allow for a meaningful analysis and comparison of these metrics and as such these metrics have been excluded from this report 

recent developments covid19 

return to healthy sailing 

we have restarted our global cruise operations in a phased manner following our voluntary suspension of global cruise operations that commenced in march of 2020 in response to the covid19 outbreak our return to service efforts incorporate our enhanced health and safety protocols and the requirements of regulatory agencies which has resulted in reduced guest occupancy modified itineraries and vaccination protocols 

by the end of december 2021 we operated 50 of our global and partner brand ships representing over 85 of worldwide capacity and carried approximately 13 million guests since we resumed operations 

uncertainties remain as to the specifics timing and costs of administering and implementing our health and safety measures some of which may be significant based on our assessment of these requirements and recommendations the status of covid19 infection and its variants andor vaccination rates in the us or globally or for other reasons we may determine it necessary to cancel or modify certain of our global brands’ cruise sailings we believe the impact to our global bookings resulting from covid19 will continue to have a material negative impact on our results of operations and liquidity which may be prolonged beyond containment of the disease and its variants see part i item 1 business  regulation for an update on the us centers for disease control and preventions cdc framework for conditional sailing order 

continued fleet rampup 

we experienced service disruptions and cancelled several sailings in the first quarter of 2022 due to the impact from the omicron variant omicron service disruptions have abated as covid19 cases have declined despite these service disruptions and cancellations the overall trajectory of our return to service remains unchanged we expect that by the end of the first quarter of 2022 53 out of 62 of our global and partner brand ships including wonder of the seas which was delivered in 

january 2022 will have been brought back to service additionally we expect that the rest of the fleet will return to operations before the summer season 

we expect load factors in the first quarter of 2022 to be lower than initially anticipated due to the omicron impact on bookings and cancellations particularly on january sailings as such we anticipate load factors on core itineraries of approximately 60 during the first quarter of 2022 with sequential monthly improvement and approximately 77 million apcds for the first quarter of 2022 core itineraries exclude sailings during the early rampup period of up to four weeks and exclude new itineraries implemented during the covid period  additionally we expect total cash flow from ships in operation in the first quarter to be positive 

update on bookings 

we experienced a softening in booking volumes and an increase in nearterm cancellations as a result of the significant shortterm disruptions experienced by the travel industry due to omicron the disruptions intensified during the holiday season and in early january with the spread of the variant 

load factors for sailings in the first half of 2022 are expected to remain below historical levels consistent with our return to service schedule which includes the omicron impact load factors for sailings in the second half of 2022 continue to be booked within historical ranges at higher prices with and without fccs we have observed cancellations subside and bookings improve to preomicron levels and we have adjusted our sales and marketing efforts in anticipation of a delayed and extended wave period 

as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 32 billion in customer deposits approximately 32 of the customer deposit balance as of december 31 2021 is related to fccs compared to 35 of the customer deposit balance as of september 30 2021 a positive trend indicating new demand 

update on recent liquidity actions and ongoing uses of cash 

as of december 31 2021 we had liquidity of approximately 35 billion in the form of cash and cash equivalents of 27 billion 01 billion of undrawn revolving credit facility capacity and a 07 billion commitment for a 364day term loan facility available to draw on at any ti me prior to august 12 2022 our revolving credit facilities were mostly utilized through a combination of amounts drawn and letters of credit issued under the facilities as of december 31 2021 we temporarily applied the net proceeds of the 10 billion january 2022 unsecured notes to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facilities bringing our undrawn revolving credit facility capacity to 11 billion as of the date of the issuance of this report from 01 billion as of december 31 2021 we continue to prioritize and bolster liquidity while taking steps to improve our balance sheet and reduce our interest costs to be well positioned for recovery 

reduced operating expenses 

we took significant actions in early 2020 to reduce operating expenses during the suspension of our global cruise operations in particular we 

• significantly reduced ship operating expenses including crew payroll food fuel insurance and port charges 

• further reduced operating expenses as the company’s ships were transitioned into various levels of layup with several ships in the fleet transitioning into cold layup 

• significantly reduced marketing and selling expenses 

• reduced and furloughed our workforce with approximately 23 of our us shoreside employee base being impacted in 2020 and 

• suspended travel for shoreside employees and instituted a hiring freeze across the organization 

during our ramp up of operations we have incurred and will continue to incur incremental spend related to bringing ships back to operating status returning crew members to ships and implementing enhanced health and safety protocols we also collected and will continue to collect deposits related to those sailings and for future cruises we take into account a number of variables in determining when to bring ships back into service including deployment opportunities commercial potential cost of operations and cash flow

executive overview 

while 2021 proved to be another challenging year for our company and industry it also marked our successful return to service starting in june we began our return to cruising with 50 ships back in service by year end representing more than 85 of our capacity we delivered safe and memorable experiences to approximately 13 million guests at record guest satisfaction scores 

the outofservice period in the first half of the year the costs of returning our ships and crew to operations the revamping of sales and marketing and the costs to execute on health protocols all had a significant impact on our financial results although we generated a fraction of normal revenue levels in 2021 total revenue per passenger cruise day in the fourth quarter was up 10 compared to record 2019 levels the increase was driven by strong onboard revenue performance seen across every revenue stream 

since resuming operations our focus has been on the safety and wellbeing of our guests and crew as delta and omicron variants started to spread they created shortterm operational challenges as well as an increase in cancellations however our health and safety protocols including our crew and guest vaccination requirements proved to be successful as only 019 of our guests tested positive for covid19 as infection rates decline and localities lift covid19 protocols we will continue to work closely with health authorities to maintain protocols that promote the health and safety of our guests crew and communities we visit as part of this commitment we have optedin to the cdc’s new voluntary program in the “highly vaccinated ship” category for health and safety protocols 

during 2021 we remained focused on managing costs improving our balance sheet and preserving liquidity we ended the year with approximately 35 billion in liquidity which includes cash and cash equivalents undrawn revolving credit facility capacity and a 07 billion commitment for a loan facility we reestablished access to unsecured debt markets and successfully refinanced 23 billion of secured or guaranteed high coupon debt in some instances reducing the coupon by up to 600 basis points given the current environment and anticipated inflationary pressures we continue to take numerous actions to reshape our cost structure with a goal of further improving upon our leading precovid margins 

new hardware is a key pillar to supporting our recovery and a driver of quality demand and financial performance this past year we successfully took delivery of celebrity apex odyssey of the seas and silver dawn  all poised to significantly contribute to our yield growth profitability and cash generation additionally we look forward to welcoming two new ships in 2022 wonder of the seas and celebrity beyond  we expect to return the full fleet before the summer season of 2022 and load factors to reach precovid levels in the third quarter although omicron has caused service disruptions several cancelled sailings and a likely delay in our return to profitability by a few months we currently expect to be generating net income in the second half of 2022 

as we focus on setting the foundation for a strong recovery and longterm profitable growth we remain driven to innovate our product and maintain a strong competitive advantage we finished the year stronger than we started and continue to manage the challenges related to omicron as well as search for further operational opportunities on our journey back to financial health

year ended december 31 2021 compared to year ended december 31 2020 

in this section references to 2021 refer to the year ended december 31 2021 and references to 2020 refer to the year ended december 31 2020 

revenues 

total revenues for 2021 decreased 07 billion or 306 to 15 billion from 22 billion in 2020 

passenger ticket revenues comprised 614 of our 2021 total revenues passenger ticket revenues decreased by 06 billion or 374 from 2020 the decrease in passenger ticket reflects a 526 decrease in occupancy for the period in 2021 during which we gradually returned to service compared to occupancy during 2020 when we operated the majority of our fleet up through our global suspension in march of 2020 

the decrease to passenger ticket revenues was slightly offset by the 50 million favorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our revenues in currencies other than the united states dollar 

the remaining 386 of 2021 total revenues was comprised of onboard and other revenues  which decreased 01 billion or 161 this decrease was primarily due to the 526 decrease in occupancy noted above and a decrease in cancellation fees in 2021 these decreases more than offset a strong onboard revenue per passenger cruise day performance during our gradual resumption of operations in 2021 as well as the favorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our onboard and other revenues denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar of 45 million 

onboard and other revenues included concession revenues of 720 million in 2021 and 760 million in 2020 

cruise operating expenses 

total c r uise operating expenses for 2021 decreased 01 billion or 39 to 27 billion in 2021 from 28 billion in 2020 the decrease was primarily due to a 1371 million decrease in commissions transportation and other expenses and a 403 million decrease in onboard and other expenses due to the decrease in revenues and occupancy noted above 

the decrease in cruise operating expenses was partially offset by an increase on payroll and related expenses of 498 million due to our return to service during 2021 and the unfavorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our expense transactions denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar of 73 million 

marketing selling and administrative expenses 

marketing selling and administrative expenses for 2021 increased 1705 million or 142 to 14 billion from 12 billion in 2020 the increase is due to the ramp up of our global sales and marketing efforts in the second half of 2021 as we commenced our resumption of operations 

depreciation and amortization expenses 

depreciation and amortization expenses for 2021 increased 136 million or 11 to 13 billion the increase was primarily due to the addition of odyssey of the seas to our fleet in the first quarter of 2021 a full year of depreciation in 2021 for celebrity apex silver moon and silver origin which were added to our fleet during 2020 and to a lesser extent the addition of silver dawn to our fleet in the fourth quarter of 2021 the increases in depreciation in 2021 were partially offset by lower depreciation resulting from vessel disposals and asset impairments during 2020 and 2021 

impairment and credit losses 

for the year ended december 31 2021 and 2020 as a result of the ongoing impact of the covid19 pandemic on our operations and cash flows we recorded total impairment and credit losses of 820 million and 16 billion respectively 

primarily related to construction in progress other longlived assets and credit loss allowances related to our notes receivable in 2021 and to our goodwill trademarks and trade names vessels construction in progress rightofuse assets and credit loss allowances related to our notes receivable in 2020 

other income expense 

interest expense net of interest capitalized  increased 4475 million or 530 to 13 billion in 2021 from 8442 million in 2020 the increase was primarily due to new debt issuances in 2021 and 2020 a higher average balance on our revolver debt and a loss on extinguishment of debt of 1388 million 

equity investment loss improved by 778 million or 365 to a loss of 1355 million in 2021 from a loss of 2133 million in 2020 mainly due to decreased losses reported by our equity investments as a result of their return to operations during 2021 and receipt of local government grants by one of our equity investments 

other income was 203 million in 2021 compared to other expense of 1371 million in 2020 the improvement of 1574 million includes an increase in income of 1106 million related to the change in the fair value of fuel swap derivative instruments that are not designated under hedge accounting a onetime 144 million tax benefit recognized in 2021 and a 138 million decrease in foreign exchange losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency compared to 2020 additionally in 2020 we recognized a deferred currency translation adjustment loss of 690 million related to the pullmantur brand as we no longer have significant involvement in pullmanturs operations which did not recur in 2021 and a 200 million expense representing the cash refund expected to be paid to pullmantur guests as part of the brands reorganization compared to a 50 million expense in 2021 the 2021 increases in income were partially offset by a 626 million loss recognized in 2021 resulting from the elimination of the silversea cruises threemonth reporting lag effective october 1 2021 

other comprehensive income loss 

other comprehensive income in 2021 was 285 million compared to 584 million in 2020 the decrease of 299 million in 2021 was primarily due to a decrease in gain on cash flow derivative hedges in 2021 of 340 million gain on cash flow derivative hedges decreased in 2021 primarily due to the reclassification of fuel swap gains from accumulated other comprehensive loss into the consolidated statement of comprehensive loss income in 2021 compared to the reclassification of fuel swap losses during 2020 this decrease was partially offset by a net increase in the fair value of our cash flow derivative hedges mostly driven by increases in the fair value of our fuel and interest rate swaps in 2021

liquidity and capital resources 

sources and uses of cash 

net cash used in operating activities decreased by 19 billion to cash used of 19 billion for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to cash used of 37 billion for the same period in 2020 our gradual resumption of operations in 2021 generated increased guest ticket collections resulting in an increase of customer deposits of 14 billion for the twelve months ended december 31 2021 compared to a decrease of customer deposits of 16 billion during the same period in 2020 during our suspension of global operations the increase in customer deposits was offset by increased expenses for our vessels that resumed cruise operations in 2021 including start up costs 

net cash used in operating activities was 37 billion in 2020 compared to net cash provided of 37 billion in 2019 reflecting a change of 74 billion in 2020 the 2020 disruptions to our business led to a decrease in collections from our guests as well as an increase of refunds to guests for cancelled sailings during the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 

net cash used in investing activities decreased 338 million to cash used of 21 billion for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to cash used of 22 billion for the same period in 2020 the decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to an increase in proceeds from the sale of property and equipment and other assets of 1482 million in 2021 compared to 2020 and a decrease in cash paid on settlement of derivative financial instruments of 871 million partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures of 2646 million mostly due to our purchase of terminal a at portmiami in 2021  

net cash used in investing activities decreased 09 billion to cash used 22 billion in 2020 compared to cash used 31 billion in 2019 the decrease in investing activities was primarily attributable to a decrease in capital expenditures of 11 billion 

net cash provided by financing activities was 30 billion in 2021 compared to cash provided of 93 billion in 2020 the decrease of 63 billion was primarily attributable to higher debt proceeds and issuance of commercial paper notes of 158 billion during the twelve months ended december 31 2020 compared to the same period in 2021 offset by higher debt and commercial paper repayments of 90 billion during the twelve months ended december 31 2020 compared to the same period in 2021 additionally dividends paid of 3264 million during the twelve months ended december 31 2020 compared to none during the same period in 2021 

net cash provided by financing activities was 93 billion in 2020 compared to net cash used of 07 billion in 2019 the change was primarily attributable to an increase in debt proceeds of 100 billion in 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 and 14 billion in proceeds from common stock issuances in 2020 these proceeds were partially offset by net repayments of commercial paper of 11 billion during the twelve months ended december 31 2020 compared to net borrowings of commercial paper of 06 billion during the same period in 2019

capital expenditures 

our future capital commitments consist primarily of new ship orders as of december 31 2021 we have two oasisclass ships and three ships of a new generation known as our iconclass on order for our royal caribbean international brand with an aggregate capacity of approximately 28200 berths as of december 31 2021 we have two edgeclass ships on order for our celebrity cruises brand with an aggregate capacity of approximately 6500 berths additionally as of december 31 2021 we have two ships on order for our silversea cruises brand with an aggregate capacity of approximately 1460 berths refer to item 1 businessoperations for further information on our ships on order we have committed financing arrangements in place covering 80 of the cost of the ship for the nine ships on order for our global brands almost all of which include sovereign financing guarantees additionally we have an agreement in place with chantiers de l’atlantique to build an additional edgeclass ship for delivery in 2025 which is contingent upon completion of conditions precedent and financing

measurements and derivative instruments and note 17 commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

decreased demand for cruising as a result of concerns regarding the covid19 pandemic had and is expected to continue to have a material impact on our cash flows liquidity and financial position in order to preserve liquidity throughout the covid19 pandemic we deferred a significant portion of our planned 2020 2021 and 2022 capital expenditures as of december 31 2021 we anticipate overall full year capital expenditures based on our existing ships on order will be approximately 31 billion for 2022 these amounts do not include any ships on order by our partner brands 

material cash requirements

7 amounts represent fees payable to sovereign guarantors in connection with certain of our export credit debt facilities and facility fees on our revolving credit facilities 

please refer to funding needs and sources below for discussion on the planned funding of the above material contractual obligations 

as a normal part of our business depending on market conditions pricing and our overall growth strategy we continuously consider opportunities to enter into contracts for the building of additional ships we may also consider the sale of ships or the purchase of existing ships we continuously consider potential acquisitions and strategic alliances if any of these 

were to occur they would be financed through the incurrence of additional indebtedness the issuance of additional shares of equity securities or through cash flows from operations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

tui cruises has entered into various ship construction and credit agreements that include certain restrictions on each of our and tui ags ability to reduce our current ownership interest in tui cruises below 3755 through may 2033 

some of the contracts that we enter into include indemnification provisions that obligate us to make payments to the counterparty if certain events occur these contingencies generally relate to changes in taxes increased lender capital costs and other similar costs the indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms and are entered into in the normal course of business there are no stated or notional amounts included in the indemnification clauses and we are not able to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments if any under these indemnification clauses we have not been required to make any payments under such indemnification clauses in the past and under current circumstances we do not believe an indemnification obligation is probable 

in june of 2021 we exercised our option under our operating lease with smbc leasing and finance inc the lessor to purchase terminal a at portmiami in july 2021 for the preagreed purchase price of 2200 million upon purchase of the terminal lease in july 2021 the underlying asset was recorded as a leasehold improvement within property and equipment net our july 2021 purchase of the port of miami terminal eliminated the residual value guarantee and a requirement under the lease to post 1811 million of cash collateral on or before july 18 2021 

certain of our surety agreements with third party providers for the benefit of certain agencies and associations that provide travel related bonds allow the sureties to request collateral we also have agreements with our credit card processors relating to customer deposits received by us for future voyages these agreements allow the credit card processors to require us under certain circumstances including breach of the financial covenants the existence of other material adverse changes excessive chargebacks and other triggering events to maintain a reserve that can be satisfied by posting collateral as of december 31 2021 we have posted letters of credit as collateral with our sureties and credit card processors under our revolving credit facilities in the amount of 1933 million 

executed amendments are in place for the majority of our credit card processors waiving reserve requirements tied to breach of our financial covenants through at least september 30 2022 with modified covenants thereafter and as such we do not anticipate any incremental collateral requirements for the processors covered by these waivers in the next 12 months we have a reserve with a processor where the agreement was amended in the first quarter of 2021 such that proceeds are held in reserve until the sailing takes place or the funds are refunded to the customer the maximum projected exposure with the processor including amounts currently withheld and reported in trade and other receivables  is approximately 2850 million the amount and timing are dependent on future factors that are uncertain such as the pace of resumption of our cruise operations the volume of future deposits and whether we transfer our business to other processors if we require additional waivers on the credit card processing agreements and are not able to obtain them this could lead to the termination of these agreements or the trigger of reserve requirements 

as of december 31 2021 other than the items described above we are not party to any other offbalance sheet arrangements including guarantee contracts retained or contingent interest certain derivative instruments and variable interest entities that either have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial position 

funding needs and sources 

historically we relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations drawdowns under our available credit facilities the incurrence of additional debt andor the refinancing of our existing debt and the issuance of additional shares of equity securities to fund our obligations the impact of covid19 resulted in our voluntary suspension of global cruise operations from march 2020 up to our gradual resumption of operations primarily in 2021 the suspension of operations strained our sources of cash flow and liquidity causing us to take actions resulting in reductions in our operating expenses reductions in our capital expenses and new financings and other liquidity actions 

the company continues to identify and evaluate further actions to improve its liquidity these include and are not limited to further reductions in capital expenditures operating expenses and administrative costs and additional financings see further discussion on these liquidity actions at recent developments  covid19 

we have significant contractual obligations of which our debt service obligations and the capital expenditures associated with our ship purchases represent our largest funding needs as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 100 billion of committed financing for our ships on order 

as of december 31 2021 we had 58 billion in contractual obligations due through december 31 2022 of which approximately 22 billion relates to debt maturities 09 billion relates to interest on debt and 23 billion relates to progress payments on our ship orders and the final installments payable due upon the delivery of wonder of the seas and celebrity beyond  

as of december 31 2021 we had liquidity of 35 billion including 01 billion of undrawn revolving credit facility capacity 27 billion in cash and cash equivalents and a 07 billion commitment for a 364day term loan facility available to draw at any time prior to august 12 2022 as of december 31 2021 our revolving credit facilities were mostly utilized through a combination of amounts drawn and letters of credit issued under the facilities we temporarily applied the net proceeds of the 10 billion january 2022 unsecured notes to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facilities bringing our undrawn revolving credit facility capacity to 11 billion as of the date of the issuance of this report from 01 billion as of december 31 2021 

we have agreed with certain of our lenders not to pay dividends or engage in stock repurchases thereafter in the event we declare a dividend or engage in stock repurchases we will need to repay the amounts deferred under our export credit facilities refer to note 10  shareholders equity to our consolidated financial statements for further information 

if any person acquires ownership of more than 50 of our common stock or subject to certain exceptions during any 24month period a majority of our board of directors is no longer comprised of individuals who were members of our board of directors on the first day of such period we may be obligated to prepay indebtedness outstanding under our credit facilities which we may be unable to replace on similar terms our public debt securities also contain change of control provisions that would be triggered by a thirdparty acquisition of greater than 50 of our common stock coupled with a ratings downgrade if this were to occur it would have an adverse impact on our liquidity and operations 

based on our assumptions and estimates and our financial condition we believe that the liquidity resulting from the actions mentioned above will be sufficient to fund our liquidity requirements over at least the next twelve months however there is no assurance that our assumptions and estimates are accurate due to possible unknown variables related to this unprecedented suspension of our operations and as such there is inherent uncertainty in our ability to predict future liquidity requirements refer to note 1  general management’s plan and liquidity to our consolidated financial statements under item 1 financial statements for further information 

beyond the next 12 months in june of 2023 approximately 32 billion of longterm debt will need to be refinanced in order to maintain the companys liquidity position 

in february 2022 we entered into certain agreements with morgan stanley  co llc “ms” where ms agrees to provide backstop committed financing to refinance repurchase andor repay in whole or in part our existing and outstanding 10875 senior secured notes due 2023 9125 priority guaranteed notes due 2023 and 425 convertible notes due 2023 pursuant to the agreements we may at our sole option issue and sell to ms subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions fiveyear senior unsecured notes with gross proceeds of up to 315 billion at any time between april 1 2023 and june 29 2023 to refinance the aforementioned notes 

debt covenants 

both our export credit facilities and our nonexport credit facilities contain covenants that require us among other things to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 125x and limit our net debttocapital ratio to no more than 625 and under certain facilities to maintain a minimum level of shareholders equity the fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated by dividing net cash from operations for the past four quarters by the sum of dividend payments plus scheduled principal debt payments in excess of any new financings for the past four quarters our minimum net worth and maximum net debttocapital calculations exclude the impact of accumulated other comprehensive loss on total shareholders’ equity  

during 2020 we amended all of our export credit facilities all of our nonexport credit facilities and certain of our credit card processing agreements which contain financial covenants to extend the financial covenant waiver through and including the fourth quarter of 2021 during the first quarter of 2021 we amended 49 billion of our nonexport credit facilities and 63 billion of our export credit facilities and certain credit card processing agreements to extend the waiver of our financial covenants through and including at least the third quarter of 2022 and subsequently in the third quarter of 2021 we entered into a letter agreement to extend the waiver period for our export credit facilities to the end of the fourth quarter of 2022 during the fourth quarter of 2021 we amended 73 billion of outstanding exportcredit facilites plus committed exportcredit facilities to 

modify financial covenant levels for 2023 and 2024 following the waiver period through and including the fourth quarter of 2022 

in addition pursuant to the amendments for the nonexport credit facilities we have modified the manner in which such covenants are calculated temporarily in certain cases and permanently in others as well as the levels at which our net debt to capitalization covenant will be tested during the period commencing immediately following the end of the waiver period and continuing through the end of 2023 

the amendments impose a monthlytested minimum liquidity covenant of 3500 million which in the case of the nonexport credit facilities terminates at the end of the waiver period and in the case of the export credit facilities terminates either in july 2025 or when we pay off all deferred amounts whichever is earlier in addition the amendments to the nonexport credit facilities place restrictions on paying cash dividends and effectuating share repurchases through the end of the third quarter of 2022 while the export credit facility amendments require us to prepay any deferred amounts if we elect to issue dividends or complete share repurchases as of december 31 2021 we were in compliance with the applicable minimum liquidity covenant and we estimate that we will be in compliance for at least the next twelve months 

any further covenant waivers may lead to increased costs increased interest rates additional restrictive covenants and other available lender protections as may be agreed with our lenders there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain additional waivers in a timely manner or on acceptable terms if we require additional waivers and are not able to obtain them or repay the debt facilities this would lead to an event of default and potential acceleration of amounts due under all of our outstanding debt and derivative contracts 

dividends 

during the first quarter of 2020 we declared a cash dividend on our common stock of 078 per share which was paid in the second quarter of 2020 

during the second quarter of 2020 we agreed with certain of our lenders not to pay dividends or engage in common stock repurchases for so long as our debt covenant waivers are in effect in addition in the event we declare a dividend or engage in share repurchases we will need to repay the amounts deferred under our export credit facilities accordingly we did not declare a dividend during the seventh consecutive quarters ending december 31 2021 pursuant to amendments made to these agreements during the first quarter of 2021 the restrictions on paying cash dividends and effectuating share repurchases were extended through and including the third quarter of 2022 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial instruments and other 

general 

we are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices we try to mitigate these risks through a combination of our normal operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments pursuant to our hedging practices and policies the financial impact of these hedging instruments is primarily offset by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures being hedged we achieve this by closely matching the amount term and conditions of the derivative instrument with the underlying risk being hedged although certain of our derivative financial instruments do not qualify or are not accounted for under hedge accounting our objective is not to hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes refer to note 16 fair value measurements and derivative instruments to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our longterm debt obligations including future interest payments at december 31 2021 approximately 657 of our longterm debt was effectively fixed as compared to 645 as of december 31 2020 we use interest rate swap agreements to modify our exposure to interest rate movements and to manage our interest expense 

market risk associated with our longterm fixed rate debt is the potential increase in fair value resulting from a decrease in interest rates we use interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a portion of our fixedrate debt to a floatingrate basis to manage this risk at december 31 2021 we maintained interest rate swap agreements on the following fixedrate debt instruments 



these interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as fair value hedges 

the estimated fair value of our longterm fixedrate debt at december 31 2021 was 137 billion using quoted market prices where available or using the present value of expected future cash flows which incorporates risk profile the fair value of our fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements was estimated to be an asset of 77 million as of december 31 2021 based on the present value of expected future cash flows a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates at december 31 2021 would increase the fair value of our hedged and unhedged longterm fixedrate debt by approximately 1053 million and would increase the fair value of our fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements by approximately 50 million 

market risk associated with our longterm floatingrate debt is the potential increase in interest expense from an increase in interest rates we use interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a portion of our floatingrate debt to a fixedrate basis to manage this risk a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase our forecasted 2022 interest expense by approximately 487 million assuming no change in foreign currency exchange rates 

at december 31 2021 we maintained interest rate swap agreements on the following floatingrate debt instruments 

 

1 interest rate swap agreements hedging the eurodenominated term loan for harmony of the seas include euribor zerofloors matching the hedged debt euribor zerofloor amount presented is based on the exchange rate as of december 31 2021 

2 interest rate swap agreements hedging the term loan of odyssey of the seas include libor zerofloors matching the debt libor zerofloor the effective dates of the 4217 million and 1917 million interest rate swap agreements are october 2020 and october 2022 respectively the unsecured term loan for the financing of odyssey of the seas was drawn on march 2021 

these interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges 

the fair value of our floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements was estimated to be a liability of 707 million as of december 31 2021 based on the present value of expected future cash flows these interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to our ship construction contracts denominated in euros our foreign currency denominated debt and our international business operations on a regular basis we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and from time to time we utilize crosscurrency swap agreements and collar options to manage portions of the exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 

the estimated fair value as of december 31 2021 of our eurodenominated forward contracts associated with our ship construction contracts was a liability of 1225 million based on the present value of expected future cash flows as of december 31 2021 the aggregate cost of our ships on order not including ships on order by our partner brands was approximately 124 billion of which we had deposited 8002 million as of such date approximately 590 of the aggregate cost of the ships under construction was exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively a hypothetical 10 strengthening of the euro as of december 31 2021 assuming no changes in comparative interest rates would result in a 7304 million increase in the united states dollar cost of the foreign currency denominated ship construction contracts exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate our foreign currency forward contract agreements are accounted for as cash flow or net investment hedges depending on the designation of the related hedge 

our international business operations subject us to foreign currency exchange risk we transact business in many different foreign currencies and maintain investments in foreign operations which may expose us to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates movements in foreign currency exchange rates may affect the value of our earnings in foreign currencies and cash flows we manage most of this exposure on a consolidated basis which allows us to take advantage of any natural offsets therefore weakness in one particular currency might be offset by strengths in other currencies over time the extent to which one currency is effective as a natural offset of another currency fluctuates over time in addition some foreign currency exposures have little to no mitigating natural offsets available 

we consider our investments in our foreign operations to be denominated in relatively stable currencies and of a longterm nature as of december 31 2021 we maintained a foreign currency forward contract and designated it as a hedge of a portion of our net investment in tui cruises of €2450 million or approximately 2786 million based on the exchange rate at december 31 2021 this forward currency contract matures in april 2022 

we also address the exposure of our investments in foreign operations by denominating a portion of our debt in our subsidiaries and investments functional currencies and designating it as a hedge of these subsidiaries and investments we had designated debt as a hedge of our net investments primarily in tui cruises of approximately €970 million or approximately 1103 million through december 31 2021 as of december 31 2020 we had designated debt as a hedge of our net investments primarily in tui cruises of approximately €2150 million or approximately 2630 million 

we have included net gains of approximately 477 million and 221 million of foreigncurrency transaction remeasurement and changes in the fair value of derivatives in the foreign currency translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive loss at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

on a regular basis we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and from time to time we utilize crosscurrency swap agreements and collar options to minimize the volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than our functional currency or the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries during 2021 we maintained an average of approximately 4832 million of these foreign currency forward contracts these instruments are not designated as hedging instruments for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 changes in the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts resulted in gains losses of approximately 309 million 190 million and 14 million respectively which offset gains losses arising from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies in those same years of 243 million 15 million and 04 million respectively these changes were recognized in earnings within other income expense in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss 

fuel price risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates primarily to the consumption of fuel on our ships fuel cost net of the financial impact of fuel swap agreements as a percentage of our total revenues was approximately 251 in 2021 168 in 2020 and 64 in 2019 we use fuel swap agreements to mitigate the financial impact of fluctuations in fuel prices 

as of december 31 2021 we had fuel swap agreements to pay fixed prices for fuel with an aggregate notional amount of approximately 5273 million maturing through 2023 these fuel swap agreements are generally accounted for as cash flow hedges the fuel swap agreements designated as hedges of projected fuel purchases represented 54 of our projected 2022 fuel requirements and 15 of our projected 2023 fuel requirements the prior suspension of our cruise operations due to the covid19 pandemic and our gradual resumption of cruise operations has resulted in reductions to our forecasted fuel purchases as of december 31 2021 the company had outstanding fuel swaps of 231900 metric tons maturing in 2022 that do not hedge forecasted fuel consumption of these swaps 115950 metric tons relate to fuel swap agreements with discontinued hedge accounting in which we effectively pay fixed prices for our fuel purchases and receive floating prices from the counterparty the remaining 115950 tons relate to fuel swap agreements that were not designated as hedges since inception in which we effectively pay floating prices for our fuel purchases and receive fixed prices from the counterparty the estimated fair value of our fuel swap agreements at december 31 2021 was estimated to be an asset of 403 million we estimate that a hypothetical 10 increase in our weightedaverage fuel price from that experienced during the year ended december 31 2021 would increase our forecasted 2022 fuel cost by approximately 500 million net of the impact of fuel swap agreements

covid19 

the disruptions to our operations resulting from the covid19 pandemic “covid19” have had and continue to have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations the global efforts to contain the spread of the disease have resulted in travel restrictions and created significant uncertainty regarding worldwide port closures and availability as part of the global containment effort we implemented a voluntary suspension of our global brands cruise operations beginning march 13 2020 which has been extended through at least april 30 2021 for most of our cruise operations as of february 23 2021 four of our ships were operating with guests onboard 

on and effective as of october 30 2020 the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc issued a framework for conditional sailing order the “conditional order” that will conditionally permit cruise ship passenger operations in us waters under certain conditions and using a phased approach the conditional order will remain in effect until the earlier of 1 the expiration of the secretary of health and human services’ declaration that covid19 constitutes a public health emergency 2 the rescission or modification by the cdc director of the conditional order based on specific public health or other considerations or 3 november 1 2021 see business  regulation for further details on the conditional order 

our resumption of operations will include a staggered return of the fleet to service which will include 

• bringing the fleet from layup status to fully operational 

• bringing crew back to an appropriate staffing level and expected reduced load factors for a period of time and 

• implementing health and safety protocols on ships as they resume operations and while protocols are required 

we are working with both the cdc and the healthy sail panel hsp formed in june 2020 by us and norwegian cruise line holdings ltd and composed of leading experts in relevant fields including epidemiology infectious diseases public policy and regulation engineering and general health safety to prepare and develop our plan to meet the framework for the conditional order 

while the conditional order represents an important step in our return to service many uncertainties remain as to the specifics timing and costs of administering and implementing the requirements of the conditional order some of which may be significant further the conditional order contemplates that the cdc may issue additional requirements through technical instructions or orders as needed and that the phases described above will be further determined based on public health considerations including the trajectory of the pandemic and the ability of cruise ship operators to successfully employ measures that mitigate the risk of covid19 based on our assessment of these conditions or for other reasons we may determine it necessary to further extend our voluntary suspension of our global brands’ cruise sailings which currently extends through at least april 30 2021 for most of our cruise operations 

we have undertaken several proactive measures to mitigate the financial and operational impacts of covid19 including significant reduction of capital expenditures and operating expenses as well as the issuance of debt and shares of our common stock given the current environment we intend to continue to prioritize and bolster liquidity through cash conservation and additional financing sources which may include the issuance of new debt including convertible debt refinancing of existing debt amortization deferrals under our exportcredit backed debt facilities and issuance of common stock to ensure that we are well positioned for recovery additionally we agreed with certain of our lenders that we will not pay dividends or engage in stock repurchases until the end of the third quarter of 2022 see part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis  critical accounting policies and recent developments covid19 and note 1 general to our consolidated financial statements under item 1 financial statements for further details on the impact of covid19 on our financial condition and results of operations

industry 

the cruising industry has been considered a wellestablished vacation sector in the north american european and australian markets and a developing sector in several other emerging markets although the industry is currently experiencing challenges brought on by the covid19 pandemic we believe that cruising will continue to be a popular vacation choice in the longterm due to its inherent value extensive itineraries and variety of shipboard and shoreside activities 

as part of the global effort to contain the spread of covid19 the company and other industry participants voluntarily suspended operations in march 2020 resulting in a limited number of cruises being taken in the past year as a result representative information of market penetration and other indicators are not available for 2020 for the five year period prior to 2020 industry data indicated that market penetration rates were still low and that a significant portion of cruise guests carried in those years were firsttime cruisers we believe this presents an opportunity for operational and financial recovery and longterm growth for the industry when it resumes operations

we sell and market our global brands royal caribbean international celebrity cruises azamara and silversea cruises to guests outside of the united states and canada through the combined efforts of internationally focused internal resources and a network of independent international representatives located throughout the world historically our focus has been to primarily source guests for our global brands from north america we will continue to expand our focus on selling and marketing our cruise brands to guests in countries outside of north america by tailoring itineraries and onboard product offerings to the cultural characteristics and preferences of our international guests in addition we explore opportunities that may arise to acquire or develop brands tailored to specific markets

fleet upgrade and maintenance 

we place a strong focus on innovation which we seek to achieve by introducing new concepts on our new ships and continuously making improvements to our fleet through modernization projects and key technological improvements several of these innovations have become signature elements of our brands for the royal caribbean international brand 

we introduced the “royal promenade” a boulevard with shopping dining and entertainment venues and interior balconies on the oasis class ships and a twolevel family suite on symphony of the seas  for the celebrity cruises brand we enhanced many of the brands design features through the introduction of the solstice class ships more recently with the introduction of celebrity edge  we introduced the magic carpet a cantilevered floating platform that reaches a height of 13 stories above sea level and can serve as a dining venue full bar and platform for live music and newly designed staterooms with an infinite veranda where with the touch of a button the veranda becomes part of the entire living space 

as part of the newbuild and modernization programs we also seek to bring innovations in the areas of safety reliability and energy efficiency to our fleet 

we are committed to building stateoftheart ships at a moderate growth rate and we believe our success in this area provides us with a competitive advantage our newer vessels traditionally generate higher revenue yield premiums and are more efficient to operate than older vessels 

as of december 31 2020 our global brands and partner brands have 15 ships on order refer to the operations section below for further information on our ships on order in addition we regularly evaluate opportunities to order new ships purchase existing ships or sell ships in our current fleet while ensuring that we remain focused on the returns we generate on invested capital and maintaining a high level of discipline on capital spending and operating leverage 

we have undertaken measures to mitigate the financial and operational impacts of covid19 such as the reduction of our capital expenditures by delaying or deferring newbuild deliveries and the modernization of our ships the expected capital expenditures for 2021 are 21 billion and are mostly related to newbuild projects which have committed financing during 2021 the company expects the delivery of odyssey of the seas and silver dawn during the first and fourth quarter respectively in 2022 the company has two ship deliveries scheduled both with committed financing w onder of the seas and celebrity beyond  excluding the newbuilds the capital expenditures for 2022 will depend on the company’s schedule to return to operation moreover covid19 has impacted shipyard operations which has resulted in delivery delays for newbuilds the exact duration of the ship delivery delays is currently under discussion with the impacted shipyards

markets and itineraries 

in an effort to penetrate untapped markets diversify our consumer base and respond to changing economic and geopolitical market conditions we continue to seek opportunities to deploy ships to new and stronger markets and itineraries throughout the world the portability of our ships allows us to deploy our ships to meet demand within our existing cruise markets we make deployment decisions generally 18 to 28 months in advance with the goal of optimizing the overall profitability of our portfolio additionally the infrastructure investments we have made to create a flexible global sourcing model have made our brands relevant in a number of markets around the world which allows us to be opportunistic and source the highest yielding guests for our itineraries 

our ships offer a wide selection of itineraries that call on more than 1000 destinations in 126 countries spanning all seven continents we are focused on obtaining the best possible longterm shareholder returns by operating in established markets while growing our presence in developing markets new capacity has allowed us to expand into new markets and itineraries our brands have expanded their mix of itineraries while strengthening our ability to further penetrate the asian and australian markets the acquisition of silversea cruises added more than 500 new destinations allowing us to expand and enhance our selection of exotic itineraries

destination experiences and port facilities 

additionally in order to provide unique destination experiences to our guests we have invested in our private land destinations for instance in 2018 we announced perfect day island collection an initiative to develop a series of private island destinations around the world the first island in the collection perfect day at cococay opened in spring 2019 and includes a wide range of attractions such as a water park zip line and wave and freshwater pool as a result of the operational disruptions caused by the covid19 pandemic and in an effort to bolster our liquidity we have delayed previously announced perfect day site openings and are reassessing their timing as well as the timing of our complementary royal beach club offering portfolio we are also reassessing our investment in other destinations

generally we collaborate with local private or governmental entities by providing management andor financial assistance and often enter into longterm port usage arrangements our participation in these efforts is generally accomplished via investments with the relevant government authority andor various other strategic partnerships established to develop andor operate the port facilities by providing direct development and management expertise or in certain limited circumstances by providing direct or indirect financial support in exchange for our involvement we generally secure preferential berthing rights for our ships 

technological capabilities 

technology is a pervasive part of virtually every business process we use to support our strategic focus and provide a quality experience to our customers before during and after their cruise technology also plays a critical role in the measures and protocols that we have developed and will continue to develop to mitigate covid19 on our cruise ships for example through the deployment of our innovative electronic safety drill muster 20 program we have added convenience allowed for physical distancing and improved our guests experience regarding the mandatory safety briefing additionally through the inapp messaging technology we are enhancing guest checkin to support education testing and screening information prior to embarkation and to support onboard detection contingency scenarios and protocols and most importantly promote the health and safety of guests and crew 

in past years we have continued to integrate digital capabilities into our operations and have increased our focus in bringing in data analytics and artificial intelligence into our processes for example we have continued the deployment of our innovative guest journey solutions across our fleet from online checkin to port embarkation to onboard cruise experience at the same time we are investing in shipboard operational technology to facilitate casino play hotel maintenance as well as the optimization of marine maintenance in concert with our destination focus our island technology solutions are now enabling our guests to remain connected with wifi access order food and beverage as well as take advantage of all the island based activities with the same ease as onboard our ships 

investments in our core platforms as well as the trade and direct distribution channels are delivering the benefit of more modernized solutions with scalability and faster selfservice response times while also deploying new features such as flight packages and additional promotional offer capabilities 

cyber security and data privacy are an ongoing focus and we have made and will continue to make investments to protect our customer data intellectual property and global operations

although we grant credit terms in select markets mainly outside of the united states our payment terms generally require an upfront deposit to confirm a reservation with the balance due prior to the sailing our cruises are generally available for sale at least one year in advance and often more than two years in advance of sailing during the selling period of a cruise we continually monitor and adjust our cruise ticket prices for available guest staterooms based on demand with the objective of maximizing net yields 

as our business has grown globally our sale arrangements with travel agents may vary for instance although our direct business has historically grown at a rapid pace sale arrangements through travel agent charter and group sales are proportionately higher in the china market than in our other markets which are primarily through retail agency and direct sales 

we have developed and implemented enhancements to our reservations system that provide us and our travel partners with additional capabilities making it easier to do business with us for example we offer air transportation to our guests through our air transportation program available in major cities around the world

we maintain war risk insurance for legal liability to crew guests and other third parties as well as for loss or damage to our vessels arising from acts of war including invasion insurrection terrorism rebellion piracy and hijacking our primary war risk coverage is provided by a norwegian war risk insurance association and our excess war risk insurance is provided by our four pi clubs consistent with most marine war risk policies our coverage is subject to cancellation in the event of a change in risk in the event of a war between major powers our primary policies terminate after thirty days’ notice and our excess policies terminate immediately our excess policies are also subject to cancellation after a notice period of seven days in the event of other changes in risk these notice periods allow for premiums to be renegotiated based on changes in risk 

insurance coverage for other exposures such as shoreside property and casualty passenger offvessel directors and officers and network security and privacy are maintained with various global insurance companies 

we do not carry business interruption insurance for our ships based on our evaluation of the risks involved and protective measures already in place as compared to the cost of insurance 

all insurance coverage is subject to certain limitations exclusions and deductible levels in addition in certain circumstances we either selfinsure or coinsure a portion of these risks premiums charged by insurance carriers including carriers in the maritime insurance industry increase or decrease from time to time and tend to be cyclical in nature these cycles are impacted both by our own loss experience and by losses incurred in direct and reinsurance markets we historically have been able to obtain insurance coverage in amounts and at premiums we have deemed to be commercially acceptable no assurance can be given that affordable and secure insurance markets will be available to us in the future particularly for war risk insurance

regulation 

our ships are regulated by various international national state and local laws regulations and treaties in force in the jurisdictions in which they operate in addition our ships are registered in the bahamas malta or in the case of our ships operating in the galapagos islands ecuador each ship is subject to regulations issued by its country of registry including regulations issued pursuant to international treaties governing the safety of our ships guests and crew as well as environmental protection each country of registry conducts periodic inspections to verify compliance with these regulations as discussed more fully below ships operating out of ports of call around the world are also subject to inspection by the maritime authorities of that country for compliance with international treaties and local regulations additionally ships operating out of the united states ports are subject to inspection by the united states coast guard for compliance with international treaties and by the united states public health service for sanitary and health conditions our ships are also subject to similar inspections pursuant to the laws and regulations of various other countries our ships visit 

we believe that we are in material compliance with all the regulations applicable to our ships and that we have all licenses necessary to conduct our business health safety security environmental and financial responsibility issues are and we believe will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant government authorities in the united states and internationally from time to time various regulatory and legislative changes may be proposed that could impact our operations and subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 

cdc framework for conditional sailing order 

on and effective as of october 30 2020 the cdc issued a framework for conditional sailing order the “conditional order” that will conditionally permit cruise ship passenger operations in us waters under certain conditions and using a phased approach the conditional order will remain in effect until the earlier of 1 the expiration of the secretary of health and human services’ declaration that covid19 constitutes a public health emergency 2 the rescission or modification by the cdc director of the conditional order based on specific public health or other considerations or 3 november 1 2021 

all phases listed below are outlined in the conditional order however only the first phase listed is detailed in the conditional order the remaining phases are currently pending approval by the cdc for distribution to all cruise lines prior to being detailed in the cdcs phase 2 technical instructions 

• establishment of laboratory testing of crew and guests onboard cruise ships in us waters and upon embarkation and disembarkation 

• simulated voyages designed to test a cruise ship operators’ ability to mitigate covid19 on cruise ships 

• meeting and maintaining requirements for a conditional sailing certificate which include among other things implementing the required testing protocols a prohibition on offering itineraries longer than seven days and the demonstration at each port where a ship intends to dock of approval with us port and local health authorities which requires medical care agreements addressing evacuation to onshore hospitals housing agreements with onshore facilities for isolation and quarantine of covid19 cases and port agreements to limit the number of cruise ships at any single port and 

• a return to passenger voyages in a manner that mitigates the risk of covid19 introduction transmission or spread among passengers and crew onboard ships and ashore to communities 

we are working with both the cdc and the hsp to implement the requirements of the conditional order and establish a comprehensive set of health and safety measures at every step of the guest journey with rigorous protocols we are also designing itineraries where we will be able to control the vacation experience in compliance with the health and safety protocols contained in the conditional order 

while the conditional order represents an important step in our return to service many uncertainties remain as to the specifics timing and costs of administering and implementing the requirements of the conditional order some of which may be material to our results of operations further the conditional order contemplates that the cdc may issue additional requirements through technical instructions or orders as needed and that the phases described above will be further determined based on public health considerations including the trajectory of the pandemic and the ability of cruise ships operators to successfully employ measures that mitigate the risk of covid19 

our resumption of operations will include a staggered return of the fleet to service which will include 

• bringing the fleet from layup status to fully operational 

• bringing crew back to an appropriate staffing level and expected reduced load factors for a period of time and 

• implementation of the health and safety protocols on ships as they resume operations 

we are also reviewing and assessing the uncertainties relating to the conditional order’s requirements based on our assessment of these conditions or for other reasons we may determine it necessary to further extend our voluntary suspension of our global brands’ cruise sailings 

safety and security regulations 

our ships are required to comply with international safety standards defined in the international convention for safety of life at sea “solas” which among other things establishes requirements for ship design structural features materials construction lifesaving equipment and safe management and operation of ships to ensure guest and crew safety the solas standards are revised from time to time and incorporated in our ship design and operation as applicable the latest enhancements include the addition of the polar code which sets goalbased standards for ships operating in the polar region as well as damage stability requirements for new designs and operational measures for existing vessels compliance with these modified standards have not historically had a material effect on our operating costs solas incorporates the international safety management code “ism code” which provides an international standard for the safe management and operation of ships and for pollution prevention the ism code is mandatory for all vessels including passenger vessel operators 

all of our operations and ships are regularly audited by various national authorities and we are required to maintain the relevant certificates of compliance with the ism code 

our ships are subject to various security requirements including the international ship and port facility security code “isps code” which is part of solas and the us maritime transportation security act of 2002 “mtsa” which applies to ships that operate in us ports in order to satisfy these security requirements we implement security measures conduct vessel security assessments and develop security plans the security plans for all of our ships have been submitted to and approved by the recognized security organization on behalf of the ships flag state and are in compliance with the isps code and the mtsa 

the cruise vessel security and safety act of 2010 which applies to passenger vessels which embark or include port stops within the united states requires the implementation of certain safety design features as well as the establishment of practices for the reporting of and dealing with allegations of crime the cruise industry supported this legislation and we believe that our internal standards are generally as strict or stricter than the law requires some provisions of the act call for regulations which have not been finalized we do not expect the pending regulations will have a material impact to our operations 

environmental regulations 

we are subject to various international and national laws and regulations relating to environmental protection under such laws and regulations we are generally prohibited from discharging materials other than food waste into the waterways we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations from time to time environmental and other regulators consider more stringent regulations which may affect our operations and increase our compliance costs we believe that the impact of ships on the global environment will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world and accordingly may subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future including the items described below 

our ships are subject to the international maritime organization’s ‘‘imo’’ regulations under the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships the ‘‘marpol regulations’’ and the international convention for the control and management of ships ballast water and sediments ballast water management convention in addition to other regional and national regulations such as eu directives and the us vessel general permit which includes requirements designed to minimize pollution by oil sewage garbage air emissions and the transfer of nonnativenonindigenous species we have obtained the relevant international compliance certificates relating to oil sewage air pollution prevention and ballast water for all of our ships 

the marpol regulations imposed reduced global limitations on the sulfur content of emissions emitted by ships operating worldwide to 05 as of january 1 2020 which was reduced from 35 we do not expect that this increased limitation will have a material impact to our results of operations largely due to a number of mitigating steps we have taken over the last several years including equipping all of our new ships delivered during or after 2014 with advanced emissions purification aep systems covering all engines and actively developing and installing aep systems on the majority of our remaining fleet 

the marpol regulations also establish special emission control areas ‘‘ecas’’ with additional stringent limitations on sulfur emissions in these areas there are four established ecas that restrict sulfur emissions the baltic sea the north seaenglish channel certain waters surrounding the north american coast and the waters surrounding puerto rico and the us virgin islands the “caribbean eca” ships operating in these sulfur ecas have been required to reduce their emissions sulfur content to 01 this reduction has not had a significant impact on our results of operations to date due to the mitigating steps described above 

we continue to implement our aep system strategy for both our ships on order and our existing fleet as our new ships are delivered and additional existing ships are retrofitted with aep systems they will provide us with additional operational and deployment flexibility 

additionally all new ships operating within the north american and us caribbean sea eca that began construction on or after january 1 2016 and north and baltic sea ships constructed on or after january 1 2021 are required to meet more stringent nitrogen oxide emission limits we comply with these rules for those relevant ships in service as an added measure all of our ships under construction are being built to comply with these rules the rules have not had and are not expected to have a significant impact to our operations or costs 

recently imo approved draft amendments to the marpol convention that will require ships to combine a technical and an operational approach energy efficiency existing ship index and carbon intensity indicator to reduce their carbon intensity in line with the ambition of the initial imo ghg strategy which aims to reduce carbon intensity of international shipping by 40 by 2030 compared to 2008 while there is still a considerable amount of work ahead before these amendments can be implemented we believe the amendments could have a material impact depending on the technical and operational approaches used such as speed optimization engine power reduction etc 

effective july 1 2015 the european commission adopted legislation that requires cruise ship operators with ships visiting ports in the european union to monitor and report on the ship’s annual carbon dioxide emissions starting in 2018 additionally in 2019 the imos monitoring and reporting system imo data and collection system which is applicable to all ship itineraries entered into force while compliance with these regulations did not materially impact our costs or results of operations the legislations contemplate further obligations and restrictions which could ultimately result in additional costs or charges associated with carbon dioxide emissions 

the imo ballast water management convention which came in effect in 2017 requires ships that carry and discharge ballast water to meet specific discharge standards by installing ballast water treatment systems by 2023 compliance with this regulation has not had a material effect on our results of operations and we do not expect the continuing compliance with this regulation to have a material effect on our results of operations 

refer to item 1a risk factors  environmental labor health and safety financial responsibility and other maritime regulations could affect operations and increase costs for further discussion of the risks associated with the regulations discussed above  

consumer financial responsibility regulations 

we are required to obtain certificates from the united states federal maritime commission relating to our ability to satisfy liability in cases of nonperformance of obligations to guests as well as casualty and personal injury as a condition to obtaining the required certificates we generally arrange through our insurers for the provision of surety for our shipoperating companies the required amount is currently 320 million per operator and is subject to additional consumer price index based adjustments 

we are also required by the united kingdom norway finland and the baltics to establish our financial responsibility for any liability resulting from the nonperformance of our obligations to guests from these jurisdictions in the united kingdom we are currently required by the association of british travel agents to provide performance bonds totaling approximately £110 million additionally we were required by the civil aviation authority to provide performance bonds totaling £166 million the norwegian travel guarantee fund requires us to maintain performance bonds in varying amounts during the course of the year to cover our financial responsibility in norway finland and the baltics 

certain other jurisdictions also require that we establish financial responsibility to our guests resulting from the nonperformance of our obligations however the related amounts do not have a material effect on our costs 

taxation of the company 

the following is a summary of our principal taxes exemptions and special regimes in addition to or instead of income taxation virtually all jurisdictions where our ships call impose some tax or fee or both based on guest headcount tonnage or some other measure we also collect and remit value added tax vat or sales tax in many jurisdictions where we operate 

our consolidated operations are primarily foreign corporations engaged in the owning and operating of passenger cruise ships in international transportation 

us income taxation 

the following is a discussion of the application of the us federal and state income tax laws to us and is based on the current provisions of the us internal revenue code treasury department regulations administrative rulings court decisions and the relevant state tax laws regulations rulings and court decisions of the states where we have business operations all of the foregoing is subject to change and any such change could affect the accuracy of this discussion 

application of section 883 of the internal revenue code 

we celebrity cruises inc and silversea cruises ltd are engaged in a trade or business in the united states and many of our shipowning subsidiaries depending upon the itineraries of their ships receive income from sources within the united states additionally our united kingdom tonnage tax company is a shipoperating company classified as a disregarded entity for us federal income tax purposes that may earn us source income under section 883 of the internal revenue code certain foreign corporations may exclude from gross income and effectively from branch profits tax as such earnings do not give rise to effectively connected earnings and profits us source income derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships including income from the leasing of such ships 

a foreign corporation will qualify for the benefits of section 883 if in relevant part 1 the foreign country in which the foreign corporation is organized grants an equivalent exemption to corporations organized in the united states and 2 the stock of the corporation or the direct or indirect corporate parent thereof is “primarily and regularly traded on an 

established securities market” in the united states in the opinion of our us tax counsel faegre drinker biddle  reath llp based on the representations and assumptions set forth in that opinion we celebrity cruises inc silversea cruises ltd and relevant shipowning subsidiaries with us source shipping income qualify for the benefits of section 883 because we and each of those subsidiaries are incorporated in liberia or bahamas which are qualifying countries and our common stock is primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market in the united states ie we are a publicly traded corporation if in the future 1 liberia or bahamas no longer qualify as equivalent exemption jurisdictions and we do not reincorporate in a jurisdiction that does qualify for the exemption or 2 we fail to qualify as a publicly traded corporation we and all of our shipowning or operating subsidiaries that rely on section 883 to exclude qualifying income from gross income would be subject to us federal income tax on their us source shipping income and income from activities incidental thereto 

we believe that most of our income and the income of our shipowning subsidiaries including our uk tonnage tax company which is considered a division for us tax purposes is derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships and therefore is exempt from taxation under section 883 

regulations under section 883 list activities that are not considered by the internal revenue service to be incidental to the international operation of ships including the sale of air and land transportation shore excursions and pre and postcruise tours our income from these activities that is earned from sources within the united states will be subject to us taxation 

taxation in the absence of an exemption under section 883 

if we the operator of our vessels celebrity cruises inc silversea cruises ltd or our shipowning subsidiaries were to fail to meet the requirements of section 883 of the internal revenue code or if the provision was repealed then as explained below such companies would be subject to us income taxation on a portion of their income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships 

because we celebrity cruises inc and silversea cruises ltd conduct a trade or business in the united states we celebrity cruises inc and silversea cruises ltd would be taxable at regular corporate rates on our separate company taxable income ie without regard to the income of our shipowning subsidiaries on income which is effectively connected with our us trade or business generally only income from us sources in addition if any of our earnings and profits effectively connected with our us trade or business were withdrawn or were deemed to have been withdrawn from our us trade or business those withdrawn amounts would be subject to a “branch profits” tax at the rate of 30 we celebrity cruises inc and silversea cruises ltd would also be potentially subject to tax on portions of certain interest paid by us at rates of up to 30 

if section 883 were not available to our shipowning subsidiaries each such subsidiary would be subject to a special 4 tax on its us source gross transportation income if any each year because it does not have a fixed place of business in the united states and its income is derived from the leasing of a ship 

other united states taxation 

we celebrity cruises inc and silversea cruises ltd earn us source income from activities not considered incidental to international shipping the tax on such income is not material to our results of operation for all years presented 

state taxation 

we celebrity cruises inc silversea cruises ltd and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various us state income taxes which are generally imposed on each state’s portion of the us source income subject to federal income taxes additionally the state of alaska subjects an allocated portion of the total income of companies doing business in alaska and certain other affiliated companies to alaska corporate state income taxes and also imposes a 33 tax on adjusted gross income from onboard gambling activities conducted in alaska waters this did not have a material impact to our results of operations for all years presented 

maltese and spanish income taxation 

effective july 31 2016 we sold 51 of our interest in pullmantur holdings sl pullmantur holdings the parent company of the pullmantur brand we account for our retained investment under the equity method of accounting there was no tax impact to us as a result of this sale transaction the pullmantur group continues to be subject to the tax laws of spain and malta among others 

under the sale agreement we remain responsible for presale tax matters with respect to years that are still open under the statute of limitations 

united kingdom income taxation 

during the year ended december 31 2020 we operated 17 ships under the united kingdom tonnage tax regime “uk tonnage tax” 

companies subject to uk tonnage tax pay a corporate tax on a notional profit determined with reference to the net tonnage of qualifying vessels the requirements for a company to qualify for the uk tonnage tax regime include being subject to uk corporate income tax operating qualifying ships which are strategically and commercially managed in the united kingdom and fulfilling a seafarer training requirement 

relevant shipping profits include income from the operation of qualifying ships and from shipping related activities our uk income from nonshipping activities which do not qualify under the uk tonnage tax regime and which are not considered significant remain subject to regular uk corporate income tax 

chinese taxation 

our uk tonnage tax company operates ships in international transportation in china the income earned from this operation is exempt from taxation in china under the ukchina double tax treaty and other circulars addressing indirect taxes changes to or failure to qualify for the treaty or circular could cause us to lose the benefits provided which would have a material impact on our results of operations our chinese income from nonshipping activities or from shipping activities not qualifying for treaty or circular protection and which are considered insignificant remain subject to chinese taxation 

other taxation 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to valueadded and other indirect taxes most of which are reclaimable zerorated or exempt

 item 1a risk factors 

the risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k are important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historical results it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks there may be additional risks that we consider not to be material or which are not known and any of these risks could have the effects set forth below   the ordering of the risk factors set forth below is not intended to reflect any company indication of priority or likelihood see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a cautionary note regarding forwardlooking statements 

covid19 and financial risks 

the covid19 pandemic has had and will continue to have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations the global spread of covid19 and the unprecedented responses by governments and other authorities to control and contain the disease has caused significant disruptions created new risks and exacerbated existing risks to our business 

we have been and will continue to be negatively impacted by the covid19 pandemic including impacts that resulted from actions taken in response to the outbreak examples of these include but are not limited to travel bans and cruising advisories and the resulting temporary suspension of our global brands operations which is expected to continue through at least april 30 2021 for most of our cruise operations restrictions on the movement and gathering of people social distancing measures shelterinplacestayathome orders and disruptions to businesses in our supply chain in addition to the imposed restrictions affecting our business the extent duration and magnitude of the covid19 pandemic’s effect on the economy and consumer demand for cruising and travel is still rapidly fluctuating and difficult to predict as such these impacts may persist for an extended period of time or even become more pronounced even after we are permitted to andor begin to resume operations 

the covid19 pandemic also has elevated risks affecting significant parts of our business 

• operations due to the global public health circumstances we have decided to extend the suspension of sailings of our global brands fleet through at least april 30 2021 for most of our cruise operations it is uncertain as to whether we will need to suspend additional sailings and to what extent and upon the conclusion of such suspensions we expect a gradual return to normal sailings the suspension of sailings and the expected reduction in demand for future cruising once we resume sailing has led to a significant decline in our revenues and cash inflows which has required us to take cost and capital expenditure containment actions consequently we have reduced and furloughed our workforce with approximately 23 of our us shoreside employee base being impacted and except for the minimum safe manning shipboard crew required to operate the ships during the suspension of operations our shipboard crew were notified that their contracts would end early and they would be notified about new assignments when operations resume in the future as a result of these actions we may be challenged in rebuilding our workforce which could further delay our return to service in addition we have reduced our planned capital spending through 2021 which may negatively impact our execution of planned growth strategies particularly as it relates to investments in our ships technology and our expansion of landbased developments furthermore we have taken actions to monitor and mitigate changes in our supply chain and port destination availability which may strain relationships with our vendors and port partners on september 21 2020 the hsp submitted its report on recommendations to the cdc which includes more than 70 detailed recommendations to protect the public health and safety of guests crew and the communities where cruise ships call on october 30 2020 the cdc issued the conditional order which replaced the “no sail” order that expired on october 31 2020 while the conditional order represents an important step in our return to service many uncertainties remain as to the specifics and timing of implementation administration and costs of the requirements of the conditional order some of which may be significant further the conditional order contemplates that the cdc may issue additional requirements through technical instructions or orders as needed and that the phases required to resume operations will be further determined based on public health considerations including the trajectory of the pandemic and the ability of the company and other cruise ship operators to successfully employ measures that mitigate the risk of covid19 in addition the conditional order contains requirements that could negatively impact our results of operations such as laboratory testing of crew members and guests simulated voyages and the certification process including implementing the required testing protocols the prohibition on itineraries longer than seven days and the demonstration at each port where a ship intends to dock of approval with us port and local health authorities which requires medical care agreements addressing evacuation to onshore hospitals housing agreements with onshore facilities for isolation and quarantine of covid19 cases and port agreements to limit the number of cruise ships at any single port our ability to meet the requirements under the conditional order will determine the timing and implementation of our plans to return to service which we expect to be gradual we are currently reviewing and assessing the uncertainties relating to the conditional order’s requirements and are in dialogue with the cdc based on our assessment of these conditions or for other reasons we may determine 

it necessary to extend our voluntary suspension of our global brands’ cruise sailings which currently extends through at least april 30 2021 for most of our cruise operations it is difficult to predict our ability to meet the requirements of the conditional order and the costs associated with compliance some of which could be significant 

if we are unable to satisfy the requirements of the conditional order our operations may be negatively impacted and we could be exposed to reputational and legal risks due to the unprecedented and uncertain nature of the covid19 pandemic and cdc or department of state guidance it is difficult to predict the impact of further disruptions and their magnitude the impact of further disruptions may depend on how they coincide with the timing of when we seek to resume sailing in addition we have never previously experienced a complete cessation of our cruising operations and as a consequence our ability to predict the impact of such a cessation on our brands and future prospects is limited and such impact is uncertain 

• results of operations our suspensions of sailings have materially impacted the results of our operations we have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs associated with cancellations as we accommodate passengers with refunds and future cruise credits as well as continuing to assist our crew with their return home food housing and medical needs in addition although cruise operations are currently suspended we have incurred and will likely continue to incur significant overhead costs associated with layup of our fleet and enhanced covid19 related sanitation procedures as we cannot control adverse media coverage and we cannot predict exactly when we will resume sailing operations we are experiencing and may continue to experience weak demand for cruising for an indeterminable length of time and we cannot predict when we will return to preoutbreak demand or fare pricing or if we will return to such levels in the foreseeable future in turn these negative impacts to our financial performance have resulted and may continue to result in impairments of our longlived and intangible assets which has influenced our decision making relating to early disposal sale or retirement of assets for the twelve months ended december 31 2020 we incurred impairment charges and credit losses of 16 billion related to the impairment of goodwill and trademarks and trade names attributable to our silversea cruises reporting unit and longlived assets as well as credit losses on mostly receivables related to our sale of property and equipment following the resumption of operations our global brands and our partner brands may be subject to the continued impact of the covid19 pandemic our partner brands tui cruises and hapaglloyd cruises resumed limited cruise operations outside of the us in july 2020 with cruises of short durations with reduced occupancies and with limited or no ports of call additionally any future profitability will be impacted by increased debt service costs as a result of our liquidity actions 

• liquidity the suspension of our sailings and the reduction in demand for future cruising has adversely impacted our liquidity as we have experienced a significant increase in refunds of customer deposits while cash inflows from new or existing bookings on future sailings has reduced sharply as a result we have taken actions to increase our liquidity through a combination of capital and operating expense reductions and financing activities during the year ended december 31 2020 we executed and amended various financing arrangements which have resulted in 102 billion of incremental liquidity including 

◦ a 06 billion increase in the capacity available under our revolving credit facilities 

◦ additional liquidity of 67 billion through the issuance of new debt net of repayments and the securing of a oneyear 700 million commitment for a 364day term loan facility 

◦ £3000 million or 4099 million based on exchange rates as of december 31 2020 of available and issued liquidity under an unsecured government commercial paper program with the bank of england 

◦ the deferral of 09 billion of existing debt amortization under our exportcredit backed ship debt facilities through april 2021 and 

◦ the issuance of 226 million shares of common stock for approximately 16 billion 

we also agreed with certain of our lenders that we will not pay dividends or engage in stock repurchases until the end of the third quarter of 2022 thereafter in the event we declare a dividend or engage in stock repurchases we will need to repay the amounts deferred under our export credit facilities on august 24 2020 moody’s downgraded our senior unsecured rating from ba2 to b2 and on august 31 2020 sp global downgraded our senior unsecured rating from bb to b on august 24 2020 moody’s also downgraded the silversea notes from baa3 to ba2 and on august 31 2020 sp downgraded silversea cruises notes from bbb to bb and as a result certain covenants of the indenture governing the silversea notes have been reinstated these downgrades reduce our ability to incur secured indebtedness by reducing the amount of indebtedness that we are permitted to secure and may negatively impact our access to and cost of debt financing on february 25 2021 sp global further downgraded our senior unsecured rating from b to b and downgraded our 332 billion senior secured notes and silversea notes from bb to bb this downgrade has no further impact on the terms of the notes as of december 31 2020 we obtained an interim debt service deferral and financial covenant holiday under certain of our exportcredit backed loan facilities to generate a cumulative 09 billion of incremental liquidity during the 12 month period ended april 2021 which is to be repaid 

over a period of four years after the 12month deferral period during the first quarter of 2021 we amended our export credit facilities to defer 08 billion of amortization payments due under these export facilities the deferred amounts will be repayable semiannually over a fiveyear period starting in april 2022 our ability to raise additional financing whether or not secured could be limited if our credit rating is further downgraded andor if we fail to comply with applicable covenants governing our outstanding indebtedness andor if overall financial market conditions worsen additionally due to the complexity of the pandemic’s impact to the economy and uncertainty of its duration we cannot guarantee that assumptions used to project our liquidity needs will be correct which may result in the need for additional financing andor may result in the inability to satisfy covenants required by our current credit facilities if we continue to raise additional funds through equity or convertible debt issuances our shareholders could experience dilution of their ownership interest and these securities could have rights preferences and privileges that are superior to that of holders of our ordinary shares if we raise additional funds by issuing debt we may be subject to additional limitations on our operations due to restrictive covenants which may be more restrictive than the covenants in our existing debt agreements and we may be required to further encumber our assets also as a result of our additional debt issuances we will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain operations our ability to generate cash depends on factors beyond our control and we may be unable to repay or repurchase debt at maturity if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms or at all we may be unable to fund our operations or respond to competitive pressures any of which could negatively affect our business there is no guarantee that financing will be available in the future or that such financing will be available with similar terms or terms that are commercially acceptable to us further if any government agrees to provide us with disaster relief assistance or other assistance due to the impacts of the covid19 pandemic and we determine it is beneficial to seek such government assistance it may impose restrictions on executive compensation share buybacks dividends prepayment of debt and other restrictions until the aid is repaid or redeemed in full which could significantly limit our corporate activities and adversely impact our business and operations we cannot assure you that any more such disaster relief would be available to us 

we may not be able to obtain sufficient financing or capital for our needs or may not be able to do so on terms that are acceptable or consistent with our expectations 

to fund our capital expenditures including new ship orders operations and scheduled debt payments we have historically relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations drawdowns under available credit facilities the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the sale of equity or debt securities in private or public securities markets any circumstance or event which leads to a decrease in consumer cruise spending such as worsening global economic conditions or significant incidents impacting the cruise industry including the covid19 pandemic negatively affects our operating cash flows and currently we have no cash flows from operations in the case of the covid19 pandemic and the resulting suspension of our operations these circumstances have also resulted in credit rating downgrades see “— adverse worldwide economic or other conditions could result in prolonged reduction in the demand for cruises and passenger spending adversely impacting our operating results cash flows and financial condition including potentially impairing the value of our goodwill ships trademarks and other assets and potentially affecting other critical accounting estimates where the change may be material to our operating results ” and “— incidents on ships at port facilities land destinations andor affecting the cruise vacation industry in general and the associated negative media coverage and publicity could affect our reputation and impact our sales and results of operations ” for more information 

our ability to access additional funding as and when needed our ability to timely refinance andor replace our outstanding debt securities and credit facilities on acceptable terms and our cost of funding will depend upon numerous factors including but not limited to the strength of the financial markets our recovery and financial performance the recovery and performance of our industry in general and the size scope and timing of our financial needs in addition even where financing commitments have been secured significant disruptions in the capital and credit markets could cause our banking and other counterparties to breach their contractual obligations to us or could cause the conditions to the availability of such funding not to be satisfied this could include failures of banks or other financial service companies to fund required borrowings under our loan agreements or to pay us amounts that may become due or return collateral that is refundable under our derivative contracts for hedging of fuel prices interest rates and foreign currencies or other agreements if any of the foregoing occurs for a prolonged period of time it will have a longterm negative impact on our cash flows and our ability to meet our obligations cannot be guaranteed 

our substantial debt could adversely affect our financial condition 

we have a substantial amount of debt and significant debt service obligations as of december 31 2020 we had total debt of 189 billion our substantial debt could have important negative consequences for us for example our substantial debt could require us to dedicate a large portion of our cash flow from operations to service debt and fund repayments on our debt thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic or industry conditions limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or the industry in which we operate place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our 

competitors that have less debt make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business the economy or the industry in which we operate including the current downturn related to covid19 limit our ability to raise additional debt or equity capital in the future to satisfy our requirements relating to working capital capital expenditures development projects strategic initiatives or other purposes restrict us from making strategic acquisitions introducing new technologies or exploiting business opportunities limit or restrict our ability to obtain and maintain performance bonds to cover our financial responsibility requirements in various jurisdictions for nonperformance of guest travel casualty and personal injury make it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt and increase our exposure to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings are and may be in the future at a variable rate of interest 

despite our leverage we may incur more debt which could adversely affect our business 

we may incur substantial additional debt in the future except for the restrictions under the indentures governing our secured notes as defined below and our 9125 senior guaranteed notes due 2023 the “unsecured notes” and certain of our other debt instruments including our unsecured bank and export credit facilities we are not restricted under the terms of our debt instruments from incurring additional debt although the indentures governing the secured notes the unsecured notes and certain of our other debt instruments including our unsecured bank and export credit facilities contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and under certain circumstances the amount of debt that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial our debt instruments do not and will not prevent us from incurring liabilities that do not constitute “indebtedness” as defined therein in the event that we execute and borrow under the 700m liquidity facility the credit agreement that would govern the 700m liquidity facility would impose substantially similar restrictions including the related qualifications and exceptions as are set forth in the indenture governing the unsecured notes if new debt is added to our existing debt levels the related risks that we now face would increase as of december 31 2020 we have commitments for approximately 116 billion of debt to finance the purchase of 11 ships on order by our royal caribbean international celebrity cruises and silversea cruises brands 10 of which are guaranteed by the export credit agencies in the countries in which the ships are being built the ultimate size of each facility will depend on the final contract price including change orders and owner’s supply as well as fluctuations in the eurusd exchange rate 

the terms of existing debt financing gives and any future preferred equity or debt financing may give holders of any preferred securities or debt securities rights that are senior to rights of our common shareholders or impose more stringent operating restrictions on our company 

the holders of our existing debt have rights preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock in the event of liquidation if we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of preferred stock or convertible securities the terms of the debt or the preferred stock issued may give the holders rights preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock particularly in the event of liquidation the terms of the debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations if we raise funds through the issuance of additional equity the ownership percentage of our existing shareholders would be diluted debt or equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms 

we will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control and we may not be able to generate cash required to service our debt 

our ability to make scheduled payments on our debt service obligations or refinance our debt depends on our future operating and financial performance and ability to generate cash this will be affected by our ability to successfully implement our business strategy as well as general economic financial competitive regulatory and other factors beyond our control such as the disruption caused by the covid19 pandemic if we cannot generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service obligations or fund our other business needs we may among other things need to refinance all or a portion of our debt obtain additional financing delay planned capital expenditures or sell assets we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate sufficient cash through any of the foregoing if we are not able to refinance any of our debt obtain additional financing or sell assets on commercially reasonable terms or at all we may not be able to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt 

we are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance future operations and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities in addition if we fail to comply with any of these restrictions it could have a material adverse effect on us 

certain of our debt instruments including our indentures and our unsecured bank and export credit facilities limit our flexibility in operating our business for example certain of our loan agreements and indentures restrict or limit our and our subsidiaries’ ability to among other things incur or guarantee additional indebtedness pay dividends or distributions on or redeem or repurchase capital stock and make other restricted payments make investments consummate certain asset sales engage in certain transactions with affiliates grant or assume certain liens and consolidate merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets both our export credit facilities and our nonexport credit facilities contain covenants that require 

us among other things to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 125x and limit our net debttocapital ratio to no more than 625 refer to note 9  debt to our consolidated financial statements under item 1 financial statements for further discussion on our covenants and existing waivers 

on august 24 2020 moody’s downgraded the silversea notes from baa3 to ba2 and on august 31 2020 sp global downgraded silversea cruises notes from bbb to bb and as a result certain covenants of the indenture governing the silversea notes have been reinstated the application of which had been previously suspended unless and until any such downgrade occurred the reinstated covenants include among other things limitations on the ability of silversea cruises and its restricted subsidiaries to incur indebtedness enter into transactions with affiliates including royal caribbean and its subsidiaries that are not restricted subsidiaries of silversea cruises and pay dividends and make other distributions from silversea cruises to royal caribbean each of which may limit our ability to obtain funding and may decrease our operational and financial flexibility including the ability to make upstream payments from silversea cruises and to provide funding support to silversea cruises on february 25 2021 sp global further downgraded the silversea cruises’ notes from bb to bb which had no further impact with respect to the silversea cruises’ notes the silversea notes are guaranteed by the company on a senior unsecured basis any event of default or acceleration of the indebtedness under the silversea notes could cause the borrowings under other of our debt instruments that contain crossdefault provisions to be accelerated or become payable on demand 

all of these limitations are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications despite these exceptions and qualifications we cannot assure you that the operating and financial restrictions and covenants in certain of our debt instruments will not adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest any future indebtedness may include similar or other restrictive terms in addition our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control these include prevailing economic financial and industry conditions if we breach any of these covenants or restrictions we could be in default under such indebtedness and certain of our other debt instruments and the relevant debt holders or lenders could elect to declare the debt together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees if any immediately due and payable and proceed against any collateral securing that debt if the debt under certain of our debt instruments that we enter into were to be accelerated our liquid assets may be insufficient to repay in full such indebtedness borrowings under other debt instruments that contain crossdefault provisions also may be accelerated or become payable on demand in these circumstances our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness and our other indebtedness then outstanding 

in addition our ability to maintain our credit facilities may also be impacted by changes in our ownership base more specifically we may be required to prepay our bank financing facilities if any person acquires ownership of more than 50 of our common stock or subject to certain exceptions during any 24month period a majority of our board of directors is no longer comprised of individuals who were members of our board of directors on the first day of such period our public debt securities also contain change of control provisions that would be triggered by a thirdparty acquisition of greater than 50 of our common stock coupled with a ratings downgrade which would require us to offer to repurchase our public debt securities in the event of such change of control 

if we elect to settle conversions of our convertible notes if any in shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock conversions of our convertible notes may result in substantial dilution for our existing shareholders 

in 2020 we issued an aggregate principal amount of 1725 billion in convertible notes the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock cash or a combination of common stock and cash at our election the initial conversion rate per 1000 principal amount of the convertible notes is 138672 and 121212 shares of our common stock for our june and october 2020 issuances of convertible notes respectively which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately 7211 and 8250 per share respectively subject to adjustment in certain circumstances in connection with certain corporate events or if we issue a notice of tax redemption we will under certain circumstances increase the conversion rate for holders of the convertible notes who convert their convertible notes in connection with such corporate event or whose convertible notes are called for tax redemption and who convert their convertible notes during the relevant redemption period prior to march 15 and august 15 2023 the june and october convertible notes respectively will be convertible at the option of holders during certain periods only upon satisfaction of certain conditions beyond those dates the convertible notes will be convertible at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding their maturity date if we elect to settle conversions of our convertible notes if any in shares of our common stock or a combination of common stock and cash conversions of our convertible notes may result in significant dilution to our shareholders 

we did not declare dividends on our common stock in the quarters ended june 30 2020 september 30 2020 and december 31 2020 and do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future 

no cash dividends were declared on our common stock during the quarters ended june 30 2020 september 30 2020 and december 31 2020 we expect that any income received from operations will be devoted to our future operations and recovery 

we do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future due to our agreement with certain of our lenders not to pay dividends until the end of the third quarter 2022 in addition in the event we thereafter declare a dividend we will need to repay our debt deferral payment of dividends would in any case depend upon our profitability at the time cash available for those dividends and other factors as our board of directors may consider relevant 

our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates that are linked to changing market interest rates as a result an increase in market interest rates would increase our interest expense and our debt service obligations as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 71 billion of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates this amount represented approximately 355 of our total indebtedness as of december 31 2020 a hypothetical 1 increase in prevailing interest rates would increase our forecasted 2021 interest expense by approximately 594 million 

in addition on july 27 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority which regulates the london interbank offered rate “libor” announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit libor rates after 2021 also in 2017 the alternative reference rates committee a steering committee comprised of among other entities large us financial institutions selected the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” as the rate recommended to replace us dollar libor usd libor sofr measures the cost of borrowing cash overnight backed by us treasury securities sofr is observed and backwardlooking which stands in contrast with libor under the current methodology which is an estimated forwardlooking rate and relies to some degree on the expert judgment of submitting panel members on december 4 2020 ice benchmark administration the administrator of libor released a consultation disclosing its intent to cease publication of oneweek and twomonth usd libor after december 31 2021 but continue to publish the remaining tenors of usd libor for an additional 18 months through june 30 2023 these remaining tenors of usd libor—overnight onemonth threemonth sixmonth and 12months—encompass the tenors referenced in our borrowings and interest rate swaps us regulators continue to encourage banks to cease entering into new contracts that use usd libor as a reference rate by december 31 2021 however uncertainty remains as many market participants await the development of term sofr products ie forwardlooking rates and benchmark providers are developing indices that might coexist with sofr if libor ceases to exist the level of interest payments on the portion of our indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates would be affected which may materially impact the amount of our interest payments under such debt further if we the agent or the lenders holding a majority of the outstanding loans or commitments under such indebtedness determine that a libor rate is no longer available that a specific date has been announced after which a libor rate will no longer be made available or that syndicated loans are being executed or amended to adopt a replacement rate then the terms of such indebtedness will allow us and the applicable agent to amend such indebtedness to implement a replacement rate subject to the negative consent of the lenders holding a majority of the outstanding loans or commitments such replacement rate will give due consideration to any evolving or thenexisting conventions for similar credit facilities which may result in different than expected interest payments 

macroeconomic business market and operational risks 

adverse worldwide economic or other conditions could reduce the demand for cruises and passenger spending adversely impacting our operating results cash flows and financial condition including impairing the value of our goodwill ships trademarks and other assets and potentially affecting other critical accounting estimates where the change may be material to our operating results 

in addition to health and safety concerns demand for cruises is affected by international national and local economic conditions weak or uncertain economic conditions may impact consumer confidence and pose a risk as vacationers postpone or reduce discretionary spending this in turn may result in cruise booking slowdowns decreased cruise prices and lower onboard revenues even after the covid19 pandemic has ended andor related health and safety concerns are reduced given the global nature of our business we are exposed to many different economies and our business could be hurt by challenging conditions in any of our markets any significant deterioration of international national or local economic conditions including those resulting from geopolitical events andor international disputes and the current economic and employment impact of the covid19 pandemic in countries where many of our customers reside could result in a prolonged period of booking slowdowns depressed cruise prices andor reduced onboard revenues even after the covid19 pandemic has ended andor related health and safety concerns are reduced additionally the continued impact of covid19 on the financial markets is complicated and we cannot predict its effect on geopolitical events andor international trade policies as countries attempt to mitigate the impact of the pandemic and as they reopen their economies or reimplement lockdown measures additionally uncertainties resulting from the united kingdom’s recent exit from the european union may impact our business 

our operating costs could increase due to market forces and economic or geopolitical factors beyond our control 

our operating costs including fuel food payroll and benefits airfare taxes insurance and security costs are all subject to increases due to market forces and economic or geopolitical conditions or other factors beyond our control including as a 

result of rerouting itineraries due to ports closing or not accepting passengers in connection with the covid19 pandemic increases in these operating costs could adversely affect our future profitability when an economic recovery begins 

any further impairment of our goodwill longlived assets equity investments and notes receivable could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable a challenging operating environment such as is currently being experienced under the impact of covid19 impacts affecting consumer demand or spending the deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions or other factors could result in a change to the future cash flows we expect to derive from our operations reductions of cash flows used in the valuation analyses may result in the recording of an impairment charge to a reporting unit’s goodwill during the twelve months ended december 31 2020 we recognized a silversea cruises’ goodwill impairment loss of 5762 million see note 5  goodwill to our consolidated financial statements under item 1 financial statements for further information 

price increases for commercial airline service for our guests or major changes or reduction in commercial airline service andor availability could adversely impact the demand for cruises and undermine our ability to provide reasonably priced vacation packages to our guests 

many of our guests depend on scheduled commercial airline services to transport them to or from the ports where our cruises embark or disembark increases in the price of airfare would increase the overall price of the cruise vacation to our guests which may adversely impact demand for our cruises in addition changes in the availability andor regulations governing commercial airline services including those resulting from the covid19 pandemic have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our guests’ ability to obtain air travel as well as our ability to transfer our guests to or from our cruise ships which could adversely affect our results of operations 

fears of terrorist attacks war and other hostilities could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

events such as terrorist attacks war or warlike conditions conflicts domestic or crossborder civil unrest and other hostilities including an escalation in the frequency or severity of incidents and the resulting political instability travel restrictions and advisories and concerns over safety and security aspects of traveling or the fear of any of the foregoing have had and could have in the future a significant adverse impact on demand and pricing in the travel and vacation industry in view of our global operations we are susceptible to a wide range of adverse events these events could also result in additional security measures taken by local authorities which may potentially impact access to ports andor destinations 

disease outbreaks and an increase in concern about the risk of illness could adversely impact our business and results from operations 

disease outbreaks and increased concern related to illness when travelling to from and on our ships could cause a drop in demand for cruises guest cancellations travel restrictions an unavailability of ports andor destinations cruise cancellations ship redeployments and an inability to source our crew provisions or supplies from certain places due to the complex and evolving nature of the covid19 pandemic we cannot predict the duration of the effect of the current pandemic and the magnitude is dependent on the development of future events and responses from governments other authorities and individual consumers our industry including our passengers and crew may be subject to enhanced health and safety requirements in the future which may be costly and take a significant amount of time to implement across our fleet and we may be subject to concerns that cruises are susceptible to the spread of infectious diseases such as covid19 for example local governments may establish their own set of rules for selfquarantines andor require proof of individuals health status prior to or upon visiting these effects may extend beyond any resolution of the current covid19 pandemic through the development of a vaccine or effective therapeutic treatment and the impact of any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition the new operating protocols we are developing and any other health protocol we may develop or that may be required by law in the future in response to covid19 or other infectious diseases may be costly to implement and less effective than we expected in reducing the risk of infection and spread of such disease on our cruise ships which will negatively impact our operations and expose us to reputational and legal risks 

incidents on ships at port facilities land destinations andor affecting the cruise vacation industry in general and the associated negative media coverage and publicity could affect our reputation and impact our sales and results of operations 

the ownership andor operation of cruise ships private destinations port facilities and shore excursions involves the risk of accidents illnesses mechanical failures environmental incidents and other incidents which may bring into question safety health security and vacation satisfaction and can negatively impact our sales operations and reputation incidents involving cruise ships and in particular the safety health and security of guests and crew and the media coverage thereof including those related to the covid19 pandemic have impacted and could continue to impact demand for our cruises and pricing in the industry in particular we cannot predict the impact on our financial performance and our cash flows required for cash refunds of deposits as a result of the pause in our global fleet cruise operations which may be prolonged and the public’s concern 

regarding the health and safety of travel especially by cruise ship and related decreases in demand for travel and cruising moreover our ability to attract and retain guests and crew depends in part upon the perception and reputation of our company and our brands and the public’s concerns regarding the health and safety of travel generally as well as regarding the cruising industry and our ships specifically our reputation and our business could also be damaged by continued or additional negative publicity regarding the cruise industry in general including publicity regarding the spread of contagious disease such as covid19 overtourism in key ports and destinations and the potentially adverse environmental impacts of cruising the considerable expansion in the use of social and digital media over recent years has compounded the potential scope and reach of any negative publicity in addition incidents involving cruise ships may result in additional costs to our business increasing government or other regulatory oversight and in certain cases potential litigation 

significant weather climate events andor natural disasters could adversely impact our business and results from operations 

natural disasters eg earthquakes volcanos wild fires weather andor climate events including hurricanes and typhoons could impact our source markets and operations resulting in travel restrictions guest cancellations an inability to source our crew or our provisions and supplies from certain places we are often forced to alter itineraries and occasionally cancel a cruise or a series of cruises or to redeploy our ships due to these types of events which could have an adverse effect on our sales operating costs and profitability in the current and future periods increases in the frequency severity or duration of these types of events could exacerbate their impact and cause further disruption to our operations or make certain destinations less desirable or unavailable impacting our revenues and profitability further any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and on industry performance 

our reliance on shipyards their subcontractors and our suppliers to implement our newbuild and ship upgrade programs and to repair and maintain our ships exposes us to risks which if realized could adversely impact our business 

we rely on shipyards their subcontractors and our suppliers to effectively construct our new ships and to repair maintain and upgrade our existing ships on a timely basis and in a cost effective manner and there are a limited number of shipyards with the capability and capacity to build repair maintain andor upgrade our ships as such any disruptions effecting the newbuild or fleet modernization supply chain will adversely impact our business as there are limited substitutes 

the covid19 pandemic has led to suspensions andor slowdowns of work at certain shipyards which impacts our ability to construct new ships when and as planned our ability to timely and costeffectively procure new capacity and our ability to execute scheduled drydocks andor fleet modernizations the effects of the covid19 pandemic on the shipyards their subcontractors and our suppliers have resulted in delays in our previously scheduled ship deliveries which are currently under discussion with the shipyards variations from our plan could have a significant negative impact on our business operations and financial condition 

building repairing maintaining andor upgrading a ship is sophisticated work that involves significant risks in addition the prices of labor andor various commodities that are used in the construction of ships can be subject to volatile price changes including the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates shipyards their subcontractors andor our suppliers may encounter financial technical or design problems when doing these jobs if materialized these problems could impact the timely delivery or costs of new ships or the ability of shipyards to repair and upgrade our fleet in accordance with our needs or expectations in addition delays mechanical faults andor unforeseen incidents may result in cancellation of cruises or in more severe situations delays of new ship orders or necessitate unscheduled drydocks such events could result in lost revenue increased operating expenses or both and thus adversely affect our results of operations 

an increase in capacity worldwide or excess capacity in a particular market could adversely impact our cruise sales andor pricing 

although our ships can be redeployed cruise sales andor pricing may be impacted by the introduction of new ships into the marketplace reductions in cruise capacity overall market growth and deployment decisions of ourselves and our competitors as of december 31 2020 a total of 105 new ships with approximately 217600 berths were on order for delivery through 2027 in the cruise industry including 15 ships currently scheduled to be delivered to us the further net growth in capacity from these new ships and future orders without an increase in the cruise industry’s demand andor share of the vacation market could depress cruise prices and impede our ability to achieve yield improvement additionally due to our global suspension of operations and the suspension of operations by other cruise operators cruise prices and yield improvement are further at risk depending on how when and where global operations resume 

in addition to the extent that we or our competitors deploy ships to a particular itineraryregion and the resulting capacity in that region exceeds the demand we may lower pricing and profitability may be lower than anticipated this risk exists in emerging cruise markets where capacity has grown rapidly over the past few years and in mature markets where excess capacity is typically redeployed any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition including potentially impairing the value of our ships and other assets 

unavailability of ports of call may adversely affect our results of operations 

we believe that port destinations are a major reason why guests choose to go on a particular cruise or on a cruise vacation the availability of ports and destinations is affected by a number of factors including industry demand and competition for key ports and destinations existing capacity constraints constraints related to the size of certain ships security financial limitations on port development exclusivity arrangements that ports may have with our competitors geopolitical developments and local governmental regulations and in light of the covid19 pandemic port availability could also be subject to immediate change depending on local andor onboard disease outbreaks or other government restrictions as well as limited availability when sailing resumes in addition higher fuel costs may adversely impact the destinations we choose to call upon on certain of our itineraries as they become too costly to include 

increased demand and competition for key ports of call or destinations limitations on the availability or feasibility of use of specific ports of call andor constraints on the availability of shore excursions and other service providers at such ports or destinations could adversely affect our results of operations 

we may lose business to competitors throughout the vacation market 

we operate in the vacation market and cruising is one of many alternatives for people choosing a vacation we therefore risk losing business not only to other cruise lines but also to other vacation operators which provide other leisure options including hotels resorts internetbased alternative lodging sites and package holidays and tours 

we face significant competition from other cruise lines on the basis of cruise pricing travel agent preference and also in terms of the nature of ships services and destinations that we offer to guests our principal competitors within the cruise vacation industry include carnival corporation  plc which owns among others aida cruises carnival cruise line costa cruises cunard line holland america line po cruises princess cruises and seabourn disney cruise line msc cruises and norwegian cruise line holdings ltd which owns norwegian cruise line oceania cruises and regent seven seas cruises our revenues are sensitive to the actions of other cruise lines in many areas including pricing scheduling capacity and promotions which can have a substantial adverse impact not only on our revenues but on overall industry revenues 

in the event that we do not effectively market or differentiate our cruise brands from our competitors or otherwise compete effectively with other vacation alternatives and new or existing cruise companies our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

if we are unable to appropriately balance our cost management and capital allocation strategies with our goal of satisfying guest expectations it may adversely impact our business success 

our goals call for us to provide high quality products and deliver high quality services there can be no assurance that we can successfully balance these goals with our cost management and capital allocation strategies our business also requires us to make capital allocation decisions across a broad scope of investment options with varying return profiles and time horizons for value realization these include significant capital investment decisions such as ordering new ships upgrading our existing fleet enhancing our technology andor data capabilities and expanding our portfolio of landbased assets based on expected market preferences competition and projected demand there can be no assurance that our strategies will be successful which could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations for example our ownership and operation of older tonnage in particular during the business disruption caused by covid19 has resulted in impaired asset values due to expected returns that we will not be able to recover 

our attempts to expand our business into new markets and new ventures may not be successful 

we opportunistically seek to grow our business through among other things expansion into new destinations or source markets and establishment of new ventures complementary to our current offerings these attempts to expand our business increase the complexity of our business require significant levels of investment and can strain our management personnel operations and systems in addition we have been unable to execute our attempts to expand our business as a result of the impacts of the covid19 pandemic as described elsewhere herein there can be no assurance that these business expansion efforts will develop as anticipated or that we will succeed and if we do not we may be unable to recover our investment which could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks associated with our development and operation of key landbased destination projects may adversely impact our business or results of operations 

we have invested either directly or indirectly through joint ventures and partnerships in a growing portfolio of key landbased projects including port and terminal facilities private destinations and multibrand destination projects these investments can increase our exposure to certain key risks depending on the scope location and the ownership and management structure of these projects these risks include susceptibility to weather events exposure to local politicalregulatory developments and policies logistical challenges and human resource and labor risks in addition to locationspecific 

safety environmental and health risks including challenges posed by the covid19 pandemic and its effects locally where we have these projects and relationships 

our reliance on travel agencies to sell and market our cruises exposes us to certain risks which if realized could adversely impact our business 

we rely on travel agencies to generate the majority of bookings for our ships accordingly we must ensure that our commission rates and incentive structures remain competitive if we fail to offer competitive compensation packages or fail to maintain our relationships these agencies may be incentivized to sell cruises offered by our competitors to our detriment which could adversely impact our operating results our reliance on thirdparty sellers is particularly pronounced in certain markets in addition the travel agent industry is sensitive to economic conditions that impact discretionary income of consumers significant disruptions such as those caused by the covid19 pandemic or contractions in the industry could reduce the number of travel agencies available for us to market and sell our cruises which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations additionally the strength of our recovery from suspended operations could be delayed if we are not aligned and partnered with key travel agencies 

business activities that involve our coinvestments with third parties may subject us to additional risks 

partnerships joint ventures and other business structures involving our coinvestments with third parties generally include some form of shared control over the operations of the business and create additional risks including the event that other investors in such ventures become bankrupt or otherwise lack the financial resources to meet their obligations or could have or develop business interests policies or objectives that are inconsistent with ours in addition to financial risks our coinvestment activities have also presented managerial and operational risks and expose us to reputational or legal concerns these or other issues related to our coinvestments with third parties could adversely impact our operations or liquidity due to the covid19 pandemic pullmantur sa filed for reorganization under the terms of the spanish insolvency laws in addition with the exception of limited sailings outside of the us starting in july 2020 tui cruises and hapaglloyd cruises have for the most part suspended sailings and their operations results of operations and liquidity have been and will continue to be adversely materially impacted the company may be required to continue to provide funding for these affiliated entities and it is unclear when and to what extent these entities will fully resume operations and our ability to provide such funding will be limited by the level and terms of our outstanding indebtedness further due to the arrangements we have in place with our partners in these ventures we are limited in our ability to control the strategy of these ventures if and when they resume operations or their use of capital and other key factors to their results of operation which could adversely affect our investments and impact our results of operations 

past or pending business acquisitions or potential acquisitions that we may decide to pursue in the future carry inherent risks which could adversely impact our financial performance and condition 

the company from time to time has engaged in acquisitions eg our silversea cruises acquisition and may pursue acquisitions in the future which are subject to among other factors the company’s ability to identify attractive business opportunities and to negotiate favorable terms for such opportunities accordingly the company cannot make any assurances that potential acquisitions will be completed timely or at all or that if completed we would realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisition acquisitions also carry inherent risks such as among others 1 the potential delay or failure of our efforts to successfully integrate business processes and realizing expected synergies 2 difficulty in aligning procedures controls andor policies and 3 future unknown liabilities and costs that may be associated with an acquisition in addition acquisitions may also adversely impact our liquidity andor debt levels and the recognized value of goodwill and other intangible assets can be negatively affected by unforeseen events andor circumstances which may result in an impairment charge any of the foregoing events could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on supply chain vendors and thirdparty service providers who are integral to the operations of our businesses these vendors and service providers are also affected by covid19 and may be unable or unwilling to deliver on their commitments or may act in ways that could harm our business 

we rely on supply chain vendors to deliver key products to the operations of our businesses around the world any event impacting a vendor’s ability to deliver goods of the expected quality at the location and time needed could negatively impact our ability to deliver our cruise experience events impacting our supply chain could be caused by factors beyond the control of our suppliers or us including inclement weather natural disasters increased demand problems in production or distribution andor disruptions in thirdparty logistics or transportation systems including those caused by the covid19 pandemic any such interruptions to our supply chain could increase our costs and could limit the availability of products critical to our operations 

in order to achieve cost and operational efficiencies we outsource to thirdparty vendors certain services that are integral to the operations of our global businesses such as our onboard concessionaires certain of our call center operations and operation of a large part of our information technology systems which are also affected by the covid19 pandemic we are 

subject to the risk that certain decisions are subject to the control of our thirdparty service providers and that these decisions may adversely affect our activities a failure to adequately monitor a thirdparty service provider’s compliance with a service level agreement or regulatory or legal requirements could result in significant economic and reputational harm to us there is also a risk the confidentiality privacy andor security of data held by third parties or communicated over thirdparty networks or platforms could become compromised 

the potential unavailability of insurance coverage an inability to obtain insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates or our failure to have coverage in sufficient amounts to cover our incurred losses may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

we seek to maintain appropriate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates we normally insure based on the cost of an asset rather than replacement value and we also elect to selfinsure coinsure or use deductibles in certain circumstances for certain risks such as loss of use of a ship or other business interruption the limits of insurance coverage we purchase are based on the availability of the coverage evaluation of our risk profile and cost of coverage we do not carry business interruption insurance and accordingly we have no insurance coverage for loss of revenues or earnings from our ships or other operations accordingly we are not protected against all risks and we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred which could result in an unexpected decrease in our revenue and results of operations in the event of an incident 

we are members of four protection and indemnity “pi” clubs which are part of a worldwide group of 13 pi clubs known as the international group of pi clubs the “ig” pi coverage provided by the clubs is on a mutual basis and we are subject to additional premium calls in the event of a catastrophic loss incurred by any member of the 13 pi clubs whereby the reinsurance limits purchased by the ig are exhausted we are also subject to additional premium calls based on investment and underwriting shortfalls experienced by our own individual insurers certain liabilities costs and expenses associated with covid19 cases identified on or traced to our vessels are eligible for insurance coverage under our participation in these pi clubs 

we cannot be certain that insurance and reinsurance coverage will be available to us and at commercially reasonable rates in the future or at all or if available that it will be sufficient to cover potential claims additionally if we or other insureds sustain significant losses the result may be higher insurance premiums cancellation of coverage or the inability to obtain coverage the covid19 pandemic for example depending on its ongoing scope and duration and the associated insurance claims volumes driven by the pandemic may potentially impact the insurance markets we rely on for coverage and could adversely impact both the coverage options available to us in the future as well as the premium costs we are required to pay for those coverages such events could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

disruptions in our shoreside or shipboard operations or our information systems may adversely affect our results of operations 

our principal executive office and principal shoreside operations are located in florida and we have shoreside offices throughout the world actual or threatened natural disasters eg hurricanestyphoons earthquakes tornadoes fires or floods municipal lockdowns curfews quarantines or similar events in these locations may have a material impact on our business continuity reputation and results of operations for instance all company shoreside operations are working remotely due to the covid19 pandemic which has posed increased technological risks in addition substantial or repeated information system failures computer viruses or cyber attacks impacting our shoreside or shipboard operations could adversely impact our business we do not generally carry business interruption insurance for our shoreside or shipboard operations or our information systems as such any losses or damages incurred by us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

provisions of our articles of incorporation bylaws and liberian law could inhibit others from acquiring us prevent a change of control and may prevent efforts by our shareholders to change our management 

certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and liberian law may inhibit third parties from effectuating a change of control of the company without approval from our board of directors which could result in the entrenchment of current management these include provisions in our articles of incorporation that prevent third parties other than a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates and their permitted transferees from acquiring beneficial ownership of more than 49 of our outstanding shares without the consent of our board of directors 

compliance and regulatory risks 

changes in us or other countries’ foreign travel policy may affect our results of operations 

changes in us foreign policy could result in the imposition of travel restrictions or travel bans on us persons to certain countries or result in the imposition of us travel advisories warnings rules regulations or legislation that could expose us to penalties or claims of monetary damages the timing and scope of these changes are unpredictable and they could cause us to cancel scheduled sailings possibly on short notice or could result in possible litigation against us this in turn could decrease 

our revenue increase our operating costs and otherwise impair our profitability for instance in june 2019 the us government announced that cruise ships would no longer be allowed to travel between the us and cuba this required us to change our high yielding cuba sailings on short notice which impacted our earnings moreover in may 2019 the us government activated title iii of the cuban liberty and solidarity libertad act of 1996 popularly known as the helmsburton act this allowed certain individuals whose property was confiscated by the cuban government to sue in us courts anyone who “traffics” in the property in question the activation of title iii has resulted in litigation against us and others in the tourism industry 

additionally in the first quarter of 2020 the us department of state along with other governments including canada issued travel advisories warning against cruise travel as a result of the covid19 pandemic and subsequently imposed restrictions on those entering the us and many nations imposed strict temporary restrictions on international travel this combined with other factors ultimately lead to the company voluntarily suspending the sailings of our fleet globally and may limit or slow our ability to resume operations in the near term in addition to the loss of revenues our financial condition is affected by refund requests future cruise credit issuances and other costs associated with returning passengers and crew home safely furthermore many countries have adopted restrictions against us travelers and we currently cannot predict when those restrictions will be eased 

growing antitourism sentiments and environmental concerns related to cruising could adversely impact our operations 

certain ports and destinations are facing a surge of both cruise and noncruise tourism which in certain cases has fueled antitourism sentiments and related countermeasures to limit the volume of tourists allowed in these destinations in certain destinations countermeasures to limit the volume of tourists are being contemplated andor put into effect including proposed limits on cruise ships and cruise passengers potential restrictions in ports and destinations such as venice barcelona or key west could limit the itinerary and destination options we can offer our passengers going forward some environmental groups have also generated negative publicity about the environmental impact of the cruise vacation industry and are advocating for more stringent regulation of ship emissions at berth and at sea these antitourism sentiments and growing environmental scrutiny of the cruise industry and any related countermeasures could adversely impact our operations and financial results and subject us to increasing compliance costs 

environmental labor health and safety financial responsibility and other maritime regulations could affect operations and increase operating costs 

the us and various state and foreign government or regulatory agencies have enacted or may enact environmental regulations or policies such as requiring the use of low sulfur fuels eg imo 2020 that could increase our direct cost to operate in certain markets increase our cost for fuel limit the supply of compliant fuel cause us to incur significant expenses to purchase andor develop new equipment and adversely impact the cruise vacation industry while we have taken and expect to continue to take a number of actions to mitigate the potential impact of certain of these regulations there can be no assurances that these efforts will be successful over the long term 

there is increasing global regulatory focus on climate change greenhouse gas and other emissions these regulatory efforts both internationally and in the us are still developing and we cannot yet determine what the final regulatory programs or their impact will be in any jurisdiction where we do business however such climate changerelated regulatory activity in the future may adversely affect our business and financial results by requiring us to reduce our emissions purchase allowances or otherwise pay for our emissions such activity may also impact us by increasing our operating costs including fuel costs 

in addition we are subject to various international national state and local laws regulations and treaties that govern among other things discharge from our ships safety standards applicable to our ships treatment of disabled persons health and sanitary standards applicable to our guests security standards on board our ships and at the shipport interface areas and financial responsibilities to our guests these issues are and we believe will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world this could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise ships that could subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 

a change in our tax status under the us internal revenue code or other jurisdictions may have adverse effects on our income 

we and a number of our subsidiaries are foreign corporations that derive income from a us trade or business andor from sources within the us in connection with the year end audit each year faegre drinker biddle  reath llp our us tax counsel delivers to us an opinion based on certain representations and assumptions set forth in it to the effect that this income to the extent derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships is excluded from gross income for us federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 883 of the internal revenue code we believe that most of our income including that of our subsidiaries is derived from or incidental to the international operation of ships 

our ability to rely on section 883 could be challenged or could change in the future provisions of the internal revenue code including section 883 are subject to legislative change at any time moreover changes could occur in the future with 

respect to the identity residence or holdings of our direct or indirect shareholders trading volume or trading frequency of our shares or relevant foreign tax laws of liberia or bahamas such that they no longer qualify as equivalent exemption jurisdictions that could affect our eligibility for the section 883 exemption accordingly there can be no assurance that we will continue to be exempt from us income tax on us source shipping income in the future if we were not entitled to the benefit of section 883 we and our subsidiaries would be subject to us taxation on a portion of the income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships which would reduce our net income 

additionally portions of our business are operated by companies that are within the united kingdom tonnage tax regime further some of our operations are conducted in jurisdictions where we rely on tax treaties to provide exemption from taxation to the extent the united kingdom tonnage tax laws change or we do not continue to meet the applicable qualification requirements or if tax treaties are changed or revoked we may be required to pay higher income tax in these jurisdictions adversely impacting our results of operations 

as budgetary constraints continue to adversely impact the jurisdictions in which we operate increases in income tax regulations tax audits or tax reform affecting our operations may be imposed 

we are not a us corporation and our shareholders may be subject to the uncertainties of a foreign legal system in protecting their interests 

our corporate affairs are governed by our articles of incorporation and bylaws and by the business corporation act of liberia the provisions of the business corporation act of liberia resemble provisions of the corporation laws of a number of states in the us however there are very few judicial cases in liberia interpreting the business corporation act of liberia while the business corporation act of liberia provides that it is to be applied and construed to make the laws of liberia with respect of the subject matter of the business corporation act of liberia uniform with the laws of the state of delaware and other states with substantially similar legislative provisions there have been few liberian court cases interpreting the business corporation act of liberia and we cannot predict whether liberian courts would reach the same conclusions as united states courts the right of shareholders to bring a derivative action in liberian courts may be more limited than in us jurisdictions there may also be practical difficulties for shareholders attempting to bring suit in liberia and liberian courts may or may not recognize and enforce foreign judgments thus our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests with respect to actions by management directors or controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a us jurisdiction 

general risk factors 

conducting business globally may result in increased costs and other risks 

we operate our business globally which exposes us to a number of risks including increased exposure to a wider range of regional and local economic conditions volatile local political conditions potential changes in duties and taxes including changing andor uncertain interpretations of existing tax laws and regulations required compliance with additional laws and policies affecting cruising vacation or maritime businesses or governing the operations of foreignbased companies currency fluctuations interest rate movements difficulties in operating under local business environments port quality and availability in certain regions us and global antibribery laws or regulations imposition of trade barriers and restrictions on repatriation of earnings 

our future growth strategies increasingly depend on the growth and sustained profitability of international markets factors that will be critical to our success in these markets include our ability to continue to raise awareness of our products and our ability to adapt our offerings to best suit rapidly evolving consumer demands this risk is further heightened by the covid19 pandemic as authorities in many of these markets have implemented numerous measures to contain the spread and impact of covid19 such as travel bans and restrictions shelterinplacestayathome orders and other limitations on business activity including business closures in addition these measures could change unpredictably andor could be scaled up or down in response to evolving intensity or resurgence of covid19 in or around these markets the execution of our planned growth strategies is dependent on meeting the governmental and regulatory measures and policies in each of these markets our ability to realize our future growth strategy is highly dependent on our ability to satisfy countryspecific policies and requirements in order to return to service as well as meeting the needs of region specific consumer preferences as services come back online these factors may cause us to reevaluate some of our international business strategies 

operating globally also exposes us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal regulatory and tax requirements in many parts of the world including countries in which we operate practices in the local business communities might not conform to international business standards these legal and regulatory requirements and standards may change in response to the covid19 pandemic and there may be greater uncertainty as to the interpretation and enforcement of applicable laws and regulations including those introduced in response to the covid19 pandemic we cannot guarantee consistent interpretation application and enforcement of rules and regulations put in place in response to the covid19 pandemic which could place limits on our operations or increase our costs as well as negatively impact our future growth strategies in our key growth 

markets we must adhere to policies designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance as well as applicable laws and regulations however we might not be successful in ensuring that our employees agents representatives and other third parties with whom we associate throughout the world properly adhere to them in addition we may be exposed to the risk of penalties and other liabilities if we fail to comply with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements introduced in response to the covid19 pandemic which may be subject to frequent and rapid change failure by us our employees or any of these third parties to adhere to our policies or applicable laws or regulations could result in penalties sanctions damage to our reputation and related costs which in turn could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows 

as a global operator our business also may be impacted by changes in us policy or priorities in areas such as trade immigration including any continuation of any of the immigration policies put in place by the us government in response to the covid19 pandemic andor environmental or labor regulations among others depending on the nature and scope of any such changes they could impact our domestic and international business operations any such changes and any international response to them could potentially introduce new barriers to passenger or crew travel andor cross border transactions impact our guest experience andor increase our operating costs 

if we are unable to address these risks adequately our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected including impairing the value of our ships and other assets 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates fuel prices and interest rates could affect our financial results 

we are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates fuel prices and interest rates significant changes in any of the foregoing could have a material impact on our financial results net of the impact of our hedging activities and natural offsets our operating results have been and will continue to be impacted often significantly by changes in each of these factors the value of our earnings in foreign currencies is adversely impacted by a strong us dollar in addition any significant increase in fuel prices could materially and adversely affect our business as fuel prices not only impact our fuel costs but also some of our other expenses such as crew travel freight and commodity prices mandatory fuel restrictions may also create uncertainty related to the price and availability of certain fuel types potentially impacting operating costs and the value of our related hedging instruments also a significant increase in interest rates could materially impact the cost of our floating rate debt 

the loss of key personnel our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel or disruptions among our shipboard personnel due to strained employee relations could adversely affect our results of operations 

our success depends in large part on the skills and contributions of key executives and other employees and on our ability to recruit develop and retain high quality personnel as well as having adequate succession plans and backup operating plans for when critical executives are unable to serve as demand for qualified personnel in the industry grows we must continue to effectively recruit train motivate and retain our employees both shoreside and on our ships in order to effectively compete in our industry maintain our current business and support our projected global growth in addition we may experience difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel if we reduce the levels of fixed or variable compensation that we offer including equity compensation impacted by the trading price of our equity whether in response to the impacts of the covid19 pandemic or otherwise 

as of december 31 2020 approximately 89 of our shipboard employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements a dispute under our collective bargaining agreements could result in a work stoppage of those employees covered by the agreements we may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate these collective bargaining agreements when they expire in addition existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage on our ships we may also be subject to or affected by work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements any such work stoppages or potential work stoppages could have a material adverse effect on our financial results as could a loss of key employees our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel or disruptions among our personnel 

if we are unable to keep pace with developments in technology or technological obsolescence including technology in response to the covid19 pandemic our operations or competitive position could become impaired 

our business continues to demand the use of sophisticated technology and systems these technologies and systems require significant investment and must be proven refined updated upgraded andor replaced with more advanced systems in order to continue to meet our customers’ demands and expectations if we are unable to do so in a timely manner or within reasonable cost parameters or if we are unable to appropriately and timely train our employees to operate any of these new systems our business could suffer we also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new technology or system which could result in higher than anticipated costs or impair our operating results 

in response to the covid19 pandemic there has been a search for technology to accurately detect either directly or indirectly whether an individual is or has been infected with the virus or has been exposed to someone who is or might be infected while this technology is in the early stages as this technology continues to develop we may be faced with decisions regarding what technology to adopt for testing our passengers and employees and what safety procedures to adopt for future 

sailings we may be unable to obtain appropriate technology in a timely manner or at all or we may incur significant costs in doing so a failure to adopt the appropriate technology a failure or obsolescence in the technology that we do adopt or a failure in our safety procedures could adversely affect our results of operations 

we are exposed to cyber security attacks and data breaches including the risks and costs associated with protecting our systems and maintaining integrity and security of our business information as well as personal data of our guests employees and business partners 

we are subject to cyber security attacks these cyber attacks can vary in scope and intent from attacks with the objective of compromising our systems networks and communications for economic gain to attacks with the objective of disrupting disabling or otherwise compromising our maritime andor shoreside operations the attacks can encompass a wide range of methods and intent including phishing attacks illegitimate requests for payment theft of intellectual property theft of confidential or nonpublic information installation of malware installation of ransomware and theft of personal or business information the breadth and scope of these attacks as well as the techniques and sophistication used to conduct these attacks have grown over time 

a successful cyber security attack may target us directly or it may be the result of a third party’s inadequate care in either scenario the company may suffer damage to its systems and data that could interrupt our operations adversely impact our reputation and brand and expose us to increased risks of governmental investigation litigation fines and other liability any of which could adversely affect our business furthermore responding to such an attack and mitigating the risk of future attacks could result in additional operating and capital costs in systems technology personnel monitoring and other investments 

in addition we are also subject to various risks associated with the collection handling storage and transmission of sensitive information in the course of doing business we collect large volumes of employee customer and other thirdparty data including personally identifiable information and individual credit data for various business purposes we are subject to federal state and international laws including the european union general data protection regulation as well as industry standards relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of personally identifiable information and individual credit data in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between the company and its subsidiaries and among the company its subsidiaries and other parties with which the company has commercial relations several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with emerging and changing international requirements has caused and may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices if we fail to comply with the various applicable data collection and privacy laws we could be exposed to fines penalties restrictions litigation or other expenses and our business could be adversely impacted 

while we continue to evolve our cyber security practices in line with our business’ reliance on technology and the changing external threat landscape and we invest time effort and financial resources to secure our systems networks and communications our security measures cannot provide absolute assurance that we will be successful in preventing or responding to all cyber security attacks there can be no assurance that any breach or incident will not have a material impact on our operations and financial results 

any breach theft loss or fraudulent use of guest employee thirdparty or company data could adversely impact our reputation and brand and our ability to retain or attract new customers and expose us to risks of data loss business disruption governmental investigation litigation and other liability any of which could adversely affect our business significant capital investments and other expenditures could be required to remedy the problem and prevent future breaches including costs associated with additional security technologies personnel experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached further if we or our vendors experience significant data security breaches or fail to detect and appropriately respond to significant data security breaches we could be exposed to government enforcement actions and private litigation 

litigation enforcement actions fines or penalties could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations andor damage our reputation 

our business is subject to various us and international laws and regulations that could lead to enforcement actions fines civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims and damages in addition improper conduct by our employees agents or joint venture partners could damage our reputation andor lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties including substantial monetary fines in certain circumstances it may not be economical to defend against such matters andor our legal strategy may not ultimately result in us prevailing in a matter such events could lead to an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations in addition we have experienced and may continue to experience increases in litigation pertaining to the covid19 crisis including potential claims for nonrefundable cash deposits we cannot predict the quantum or outcome of any such proceedings and the impact that they will have on our financial results but any such impact may be material while some of these claims are covered by insurance we cannot be certain that all of them will be which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations

 item 3 legal proceedings 

as previously reported two lawsuits were filed against royal caribbean cruises ltd in august 2019 in the us district court for the southern district of florida under title iii of the cuban liberty and democratic solidarity act also known as the helmsburton act the complaint filed by havana docks corporation havana docks action alleges it holds an interest in the havana cruise port terminal and the complaint filed by javier garciabengochea the port of santiago action alleges that he holds an interest in the port of santiago cuba both of which were expropriated by the cuban government the complaints further allege that royal caribbean cruises ltd trafficked in those properties by embarking and disembarking passengers at these facilities the plaintiffs seek all available statutory remedies including the value of the expropriated property plus interest treble damages attorneys’ fees and costs royal caribbean cruises ltd filed its answer to each complaint in october 2019 and on october 15 2020 and the court dismissed the port of santiago action with prejudice on the basis that the plaintiffs in that action lacked standing to bring the claim this decision has been appealed by the plaintiffs we believe we have meritorious defenses to the claims alleged in both the havana docks action and the port of santiago action and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against them we believe that it is unlikely that the outcome of either action will have a material adverse impact to our financial condition results of operations or cash flows however the outcome of litigation is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties and there can be no assurances that the final outcome of this case will not be material 

as previously reported on october 7 2020 a shareholder filed a putative class action complaint against us and three officers richard fain jason liberty and michael bayley in the united states district court for the southern district of florida the court alleging misrepresentations relating to covid19 in violation of sections 10b and 20a of the securities exchange act of 1934 and rule 10b5 seeking unspecified damages on behalf of a purported class consisting of all persons and entities subject to specified exceptions that purchased or otherwise acquired our securities from february 4 2020 through march 17 2020 as previously disclosed on october 27 2020 a second complaint was filed by another shareholder against us and these same officers in the court alleging the same misrepresentations relating to covid19 as is the case with the first action the second action seeks unspecified damages on behalf of a purported class consisting of all persons and entities subject to specified exceptions that purchased or otherwise acquired our securities from february 4 2020 through march 17 2020 on december 23 2020 these cases were consolidated with a new lead plaintiff indiana public retirement system we cannot predict the duration or outcome of this lawsuit at this time although management believes the claims are without merit depending on how this case progresses it could be costly to defend and could divert the attention of management and other resources from operations accordingly even if ultimately resolved in our favor this action could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity on february 25 2021 the lead plaintiff filed with the court a voluntary dismissal of the action without prejudice 

we are also routinely involved in other claims regulatory investigations and inquiries and consumer complaints including those related to covid19 that are typical within the travel and tourism vacation industry the majority of these claims are covered by insurance we believe the outcome of such claims net of expected insurance recoveries will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations and cash flows

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap refer to note 1  general and note 2  summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  certain of our accounting policies are deemed critical as they require managements highest degree of judgment estimates and assumptions we have discussed these accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors we believe our most critical accounting policies are as follows 

liquidity and covid19 

the effects of covid19 have had and continue to have a material negative impact on our operations financial results and liquidity the full extent of the impact will be determined by the length of time covid19 influences our industry and our eventual gradual return to service given the ongoing effects of covid19 on our operations and global bookings we have identified the estimation of our future liquidity requirements as a critical accounting policy 

the estimation of our future liquidity requirements includes numerous assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties the principal assumptions used to estimate our future liquidity requirements during our outofservice period consist of 

• expected date of return to operations 

• expected gradual resumption of cruise operations 

• expected lower than comparable historical occupancy levels during the resumption of cruise operations and 

• expected incremental expenses for the resumption of cruise operations for the maintenance of additional public health protocols and procedures for additional regulations 

the assumptions used to estimate our liquidity requirements are frequently and continuously evaluated because of the unprecedented nonoperational environment we are experiencing due to covid19 in addition the magnitude duration and speed of the global pandemic continues to be uncertain as a result we have made reasonable estimates and judgments of the impact of covid19 on our liquidity within our financial statements and there may be changes to those estimates in future periods 

we have taken and will continue to take actions to improve our liquidity including 

• reduction of capital expenditures 

• reduction of operating expenses including furloughing staff and laying up vessels 

• amending credit agreements to defer payments and covenant requirements as well as extend maturity dates 

• raising capital through debt and stock issuances and 

• suspending dividend payments 

ship accounting 

ships represent our most significant assets and are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization depreciation of ships is generally computed net of a 1015 projected residual value using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of the asset which is generally 3035 years the 3035 year useful life and 1015 residual value is the weightedaverage of all major components of a ship our useful life and residual value estimates take into consideration the impact of anticipated technological changes longterm cruise and vacation market conditions and historical useful lives of similarlybuilt ships in addition we take into consideration our estimates of the weightedaverage useful lives of the ships major component systems such as hull superstructure main electric engines and cabins we employ a cost allocation methodology at the component level in order to support the estimated weightedaverage useful lives and residual values as well as to determine the net cost basis of assets being replaced given the very large and complex nature of our ships our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain we do not have cost segregation studies performed to specifically componentize our ship systems however we estimate the costs useful lives and residual values of component systems based principally on general and technical information known about major ship component systems and their lives as well as our knowledge of the cruise vacation industry we do not identify and track depreciation by ship component systems but instead utilize these estimates to determine the net cost basis of assets replaced or refurbished improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized as additions to the ship and depreciated over the shorter of the improvements estimated useful lives or that of the associated ship the estimated cost and accumulated depreciation of replaced or refurbished ship components are written 

off and any resulting losses are recognized within cruise operating expenses in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss 

we periodically review estimated useful lives and residual values for ongoing reasonableness considering long term views on our intended use of each class of ships and the planned level of improvements to maintain and enhance vessels within those classes in the event a factor is identified that may trigger a change in the estimated useful lives and residual values of our ships a review of the estimate is completed in the fourth quarter of 2019 we completed a modernization of the oasis of the seas under our ship upgrade program the level of capital investment as well as planned investment levels in the other ships within the oasis class triggered a review of the estimated useful lives and residual values of the oasisclass ships following a review of the estimate considering the intended use of the vessel and assessment of the estimated lives of component assets forming the oasis class ships we concluded a change to the estimated lives and residual values of oasis class ships was required effective fourth quarter of 2019 we revised the estimated useful lives and residual values of the oasisclass ships from 30 years with a 15 residual value to 35 years with a 10 residual value the change in the estimated useful lives and residual values was accounted for prospectively as a change in accounting estimate for further information regarding this change in accounting estimate refer to note 2  summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

we use the deferral method to account for drydocking costs under the deferral method drydocking costs incurred are deferred and charged to expense on a straightline basis over the period to the next scheduled drydock which we estimate to be a period of thirty to sixty months based on the vessels age as required by class deferred drydock costs consist of the costs to drydock the vessel and other costs incurred in connection with the drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessels class certification class certification is necessary in order for our cruise ships to be flagged in a specific country obtain liability insurance and legally operate as passenger cruise ships the activities associated with those drydocking costs cannot be performed while the vessel is in service and as such are done during a drydock as a planned major maintenance activity the significant deferred drydock costs consist of hauling and wharfage services provided by the drydock facility hull inspection and related activities eg scraping pressure cleaning bottom painting maintenance to steering propulsion thruster equipment and ballast tanks port services such as tugs pilotage and line handling and freight associated with these items we perform a detailed analysis of the various activities performed for each drydock and only defer those costs that are directly related to planned major maintenance activities necessary to maintain class the costs deferred are related to activities not otherwise routinely periodically performed to maintain a vessels designed and intended operating capability repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred 

we use judgment when estimating the period between drydocks which can result in adjustments to the estimated amortization of drydock costs if the vessel is disposed of before the next drydock the remaining balance in deferred drydock is writtenoff to the gain or loss upon disposal of vessel in the period in which the sale takes place we also use judgment when identifying costs incurred during a drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessels class certification as compared to those costs attributable to repairs and maintenance which are expensed as incurred 

we believe we have made reasonable estimates for ship accounting purposes however should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimates of ship useful lives or projected residual values depreciation expense could be materially higher or lower if circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making determinations as to whether ship improvements should be capitalized the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance costs could increase partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense if we had reduced our estimated average ship useful life by one year depreciation expense for 2020 would have increased by approximately 1573 million if our ships were estimated to have no residual value depreciation expense for 2020 would have increased by approximately 3453 million we have evaluated our estimated ship useful lives and projected residual values in light of our current environment and determined that there are no changes to these estimates based on our return to service expectations 

business combinations 

on july 31 2018 we acquired a 667 equity stake in silversea cruises for 102 billion in cash and contingent consideration refer to note 3 business combination to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further information on the acquisition 

on july 9 2020 we acquired the remaining 333 interest in silversea cruises that we did not already own the noncontrolling interest from heritage as a result of the acquisition of the noncontrolling interest silversea cruises is now a wholly owned cruise brand as consideration for the noncontrolling interest we issued to heritage 52 million shares of common stock par value 001 per share of royal caribbean cruises ltd pursuant to the agreement governing the acquisition among other things the parties terminated any existing obligation to issue heritage any contingent consideration at fair value in connection with our acquisition of a 667 interest in silversea cruises on july 31 2018 the share purchase did not result in a change of control the purchase was accounted for as an equity transaction and no gain or loss was recognized in earnings refer to note 11  redeemable noncontrolling interest to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial 

statements and supplementary data for further information regarding our acquisition of silversea cruises noncontrolling interest 

we account for business combinations in accordance with asc 805 business combinations  by applying the acquisition method of accounting the acquisition method of accounting requires that we record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the noncontrolling interest if any at their respective fair values at the acquisition date goodwill is recognized as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired significant estimates and assumptions are made by management to value such assets and liabilities based on third party valuations such as appraisals or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques although we believe that those estimates and assumptions are reasonable and appropriate they are inherently uncertain and subject to change if during the measurement period not to exceed one year additional information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date related to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed we may adjust our estimates to account for subsequent adjustments to the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date resulting in an offsetting adjustment to the goodwill associated with the business acquired 

uncertain tax positions and taxrelated valuation allowances are initially established in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date our purchase price measurement period for the silversea cruises 2018 acquisition was closed during 2019 

any contingent consideration is estimated at fair value at the acquisition date liabilityclassified contingent consideration is remeasured each reporting period with changes in fair value recognized in earnings until the contingent consideration is settled 

valuation of goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets and longlived assets 

we review goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or when events or circumstances dictate more frequently the impairment review for goodwill consists of a qualitative assessment of whether it is morelikely thannot that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying value and if necessary a goodwill impairment test factors to consider when performing the qualitative assessment include general economic conditions limitations on accessing capital changes in forecasted operating results changes in fuel prices and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 

the goodwill impairment analysis consists of a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value we typically estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a probabilityweighted discounted cash flow model which may also include a combination of a marketbased valuation approach the estimation of fair value utilizing discounted expected future cash flows includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of expected revenues operating costs marketing selling and administrative expenses interest rates ship additions and retirements as well as assumptions regarding the cruise vacation industrys competitive environment and general economic and business conditions among other factors the principal assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model for our 2020 impairment assessments were 

• the timing of our return to service changes in market conditions and port or other restrictions 

• forecasted net revenues primarily the timing of returning to normalized operations occupancy rates from existing and expected ship deliveries including options and terminal growth rate and 

• weighted average cost of capital ie discount rate 

the discounted cash flow model uses the most current projected operating results for the upcoming fiscal year as a base to that base we add future years cash flows based on multiple revenue and expense scenarios reflecting the impact of various return to service management assumptions beyond the base year on the reporting unit we discount the projected cash flows using rates specific to the reporting unit based on its weightedaverage cost of capital 

if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value no writedown of goodwill is required as amended by asu no 201704 intangibles  goodwill and other topic 350 – simplifying the test for goodwill impairment  if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of its net assets an impairment is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to such reporting unit 

the impairment review for indefinitelife intangible assets can be performed using a qualitative or quantitative impairment assessment the quantitative assessment consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying value we estimate the fair value of these assets using a discounted cash flow model and various valuation methods depending on the nature of the intangible asset such as the relieffromroyalty method for trademarks and trade names the principal assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model for our 2020 impairment assessments were 

• forecasted net revenues primarily the timing of returning to normalized operations occupancy rates from existing and expected ship deliveries including options and terminal growth rate 

• royalty rate and 

• weighted average cost of capital ie discount rate 

if the carrying value exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess if the fair value exceeds its carrying value the indefinitelife intangible asset is not considered impaired other intangible assets assigned finite useful lives are amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives refer to note 6 intangible assets to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplemental data for further information on indefinitelife intangible assets 

we review our ships and other longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows that the carrying value of these assets may not be fully recoverable we evaluate asset impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities the lowest level for which we maintain identifiable cash flows that are independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities is at the ship level for our ships if estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of an asset an impairment charge is recognized to the extent its carrying value exceeds fair value refer to note 7  property and equipment to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplemental data for further information on determination of fair value for longlived assets 

we estimate fair value based on quoted market prices in active markets if available if active markets are not available we base fair value on independent appraisals sales price negotiations and projected future cash flows discounted at a rate estimated by management to be commensurate with the business risk quoted market prices are often not available for individual reporting units and for indefinitelife intangible assets accordingly we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit and an indefinitelife intangible asset using an expected present value technique 

the outbreak of covid19 has resulted in an unprecedented global response to contain the spread and control the resurgence of the disease these global efforts have resulted in travel restrictions and created significant uncertainty regarding worldwide port closures and availability of ports and destinations generally as part of the global containment effort the company previously announced a voluntary suspension of its global brands cruise operations through at least april 30 2021 for most of our cruise operations 

as a result of the developments in 2020 we performed interim impairment evaluations in addition to our annual impairment reviews of certain of our goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets and longlived assets in connection with the preparation of our 2020 quarterly and annual financial statements as further discussed below 

royal caribbean international reporting unit 

we performed interim impairment evaluations of royal caribbean international’s goodwill in connection with the preparation of our quarterly financial statements for the periods ended march 31 2020 and june 30 2020 due to the significant impact that covid19 has had on our projected cash flows and triggering events identified in those quarters our extended suspension of our operations and the possibility of further extensions created some uncertainty in forecasting the operating results and future cash flows used in our impairment analyses as a result of the tests we determined that the fair value of the royal caribbean international reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 30 and 8 as of march 31 2020 and june 30 2020 respectively resulting in no impairment to the royal caribbean international goodwill in those periods the fair value of the royal caribbean international reporting unit as of march 31 2020 was determined using a discounted cash flow model and a probabilityweighted discounted cash flow model in combination with a market based valuation approach for the june 30 2020 and november 30 2020 assessments we did not perform interim impairment evaluation of royal caribbean internationals goodwill during the quarter ended september 30 2020 as no triggering events were identified 

during the fourth quarter of 2020 we performed our annual impairment review of goodwill for royal caribbean internationals reporting unit we did not perform a qualitative assessment but instead proceeded directly to the goodwill impairment test as a result of the test we determined the fair value of the royal caribbean international reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 14 resulting in no impairment to royal caribbean internationals goodwill as of december 31 2020 the carrying value of goodwill attributable to our royal caribbean reporting unit was 2966 million 

silversea cruises reporting unit 

we performed interim impairment evaluations of silversea cruises’ goodwill and trade name in connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the quarter ended march 31 2020 as a result of these analyses we determined that the carrying value of the silversea cruises reporting unit exceeded its fair value similarly we determined that the carrying value of silversea cruises’ trade name exceeded its fair value accordingly upon the completion of the impairment test we recognized impairment charges of 5762 million and 308 million for goodwill and the trade name respectively during the 

quarter ended march 31 2020 we estimated the fair value of the silversea cruises reporting unit using a probabilityweighted discounted cash flow model in combination with a market based valuation approach we did not perform interim impairment evaluations of silversea cruises reporting unit or trade names during the quarters ended june 30 2020 and september 30 2020 as no triggering events were identified 

during the fourth quarter of 2020 we performed our annual impairment review of silversea cruises goodwill we did not perform a qualitative assessment but instead proceeded directly to the goodwill impairment test as a result of the test we determined the fair value of the silversea cruises reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 12 resulting in no impairment to silversea cruises goodwill as of december 31 2020 the carrying value of goodwill attributable to our silversea cruises reporting unit was 5086 million 

during the fourth quarter of 2020 we performed our annual impairment review of silversea cruises trade name as a result of the quantitative test we determined that the fair value of the silversea cruises trade name exceeded its carrying value by approximately 3 resulting in no impairment to silversea cruises tr ade name we will continue to closely monitor the change in fair value of the silversea cruises trade name any further adverse developments due to covid19 or other events affecting the projected cash flows for silversea cruises may lead to further impairment of the silversea cruises trade name as of december 31 2020 and 2019 the carrying value of indefinitelife intangible assets was 3215 million and 3523 million respectively which primarily relates to the silversea cruises trade name 

longlived assets 

events surrounding the covid19 pandemic negatively impacted the expected undiscounted cash flows of certain of our longlived assets we evaluated these assets during the year ended 2020 pursuant to our longlived asset impairment test which resulted in an impairment charge of 4642 million during the year ended december 31 2020 to write down certain ships operated by our global brands to their estimated fair values the amount also includes impairment charges for ships that our global brands disposed of during 2020 as well as the three azamara ships 

we also recorded impairment charges of 1713 million during the year ended december 31 2020 for the three ships that we chartered to pullmantur holdings prior to the filing of the pullmantur reorganization during the quarter ended september 30 2020 we sold the ships to third parties for amounts approximating their carrying values and no further impairment was recorded 

during the year ended december 31 2020 we also determined that certain construction in progress projects would be reduced in scope or would no longer be completed as a result of our capital cost containment measures in response to the covid19 impact on our liquidity this led to an impairment charge of 915 million of construction in progress assets reported in property and equipment net 

in addition during the year ended december 31 2020 we identified that the undiscounted cash flows for certain rightofuse assets were less than their carrying values due to the negative impact of covid19 we evaluated these assets pursuant to our longlived asset impairment test resulting in an impairment charge of 659 million to write down these assets to their estimated fair values during the year ended december 31 2020 

the combined impairment charge of 15 billion primarily related to our goodwill trademarks and trade names vessels construction in progress and rightofuse assets were recognized in earnings during the year ended december 31 2020 and is reported within impairment and credit losses within our consolidate d statements of comprehensive income loss these impairment assessments and the resulting charges were determined based on management’s current estimates and projections using information through the time of the issuance of these financial statements the adverse impact that covid19 will continue to have on our business operating results cash flows and overall financial condition is uncertain and may result in changes to the assumptions used in the impairment tests discussed above which may result in additional impairments of our goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets and longlived assets in the future refer to risk factors in part 1 item 1a for further discussion on risks related to the covid19 pandemic 

derivative instruments 

we enter into various forward swap and option contracts to manage our interest rate exposure and to limit our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices these instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value and the vast majority are designated as hedges we also use nonderivative financial instruments designated as hedges of our net investment in our foreign operations and investments although certain of our derivative financial instruments do not qualify or are not accounted for under hedge accounting we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes we account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with authoritative guidance refer to note 2  summary of significant accounting policies and note 19  commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for more information on related authoritative guidance the companys hedging programs and derivative financial instruments 

on a regular basis we enter into foreign currency forward contracts interest rate and fuel swaps and options with thirdparty institutions in overthecounter markets we estimate the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps using expected future cash flows based on the instruments contract terms and published forward prices for foreign currency exchange and interest rates we value floors which are embedded within our interest rate swaps using standard option pricing models with inputs based on the options’ contract terms such as exercise price and maturity and readily available market data such as forward interest rates and interest rate volatility we apply present value techniques and libor or euriborbased discount rates to convert the expected future cash flows to the current fair value of the instruments 

we estimate the fair value of our fuel swaps using expected future cash flows based on the swaps contract terms and forward prices we derive forward prices from published forward fuel curves which in turn are based on actual market transactions and published price quotes for similar assets we apply present value techniques and liborbased discount rates to convert the expected future cash flows to the current fair value of the instruments we also corroborate our fair value estimates using valuations provided by our counterparties 

we adjust the valuation of our derivative financial instruments to incorporate credit risk 

we believe it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate and fuel swaps and options would be derived from other appropriate valuation models using similar assumptions inputs or conditions suggested by actual historical experience 

the current suspension of our cruise operations due to the covid19 pandemic and our 2020 and expected 2021 ship disposals resulted in reductions to our forecasted fuel purchases as of december 31 2020 we discontinued cash flow hedge accounting on 06 million metric tons of our fuel swap agreements maturing in 2020 and 2021 which resulted in the reclassification of a net 1044 million loss from accumulated other comprehensive loss to other expense during the year ended december 31 2020 changes in the fair value of fuel swaps for which cash flow hedge accounting was discontinued are currently recognized in other expense each reporting period 

future s uspension of our operations or modifications to our itineraries may affect our expected forecasted fuel purchases which could result in further discontinuance of fuel swap cash flow hedge accounting and the reclassification of deferred gains or losses from accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings  refer to risk factors in part 1 item 1a for further discussion on risks related to the covid19 pandemic 

contingencies—litigation 

on an ongoing basis we assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss if any can be made in assessing probable losses we take into consideration estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries if any which are recorded as assets when recoverability is probable we accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recoveries it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made 

seasonality 

our revenues are seasonal based on demand for cruises demand is strongest for cruises during the northern hemispheres summer months and holidays in order to mitigate the impact of the winter weather in the northern hemisphere and to capitalize on the summer season in the southern hemisphere our brands have focused on deployment to the caribbean asia and australia during that period 

financial presentation 

description of certain line items 

revenues 

our revenues are comprised of the following 

• passenger ticket revenues  which consist of revenue recognized from the sale of passenger tickets and the sale of air transportation to and from our ships and 

• onboard and other revenues  which consist primarily of revenues from the sale of goods andor services onboard our ships not included in passenger ticket prices cancellation fees sales of vacation protection insurance pre and postcruise tours and fees for operating certain port facilities onboard and other revenues also include revenues we receive from independent third party concessionaires that pay us a percentage of their revenues in exchange for the right to provide selected goods andor services onboard our ships as well as revenues received for our 

bareboat charter procurement and management related services we perform on behalf of our unconsolidated affiliates 

cruise operating expenses 

our cruise operating expenses are comprised of the following 

• commissions transportation and other expenses  which consist of those costs directly associated with passenger ticket revenues including travel agent commissions air and other transportation expenses port costs that vary with passenger head counts and related credit card fees 

• onboard and other expenses  which consist of the direct costs associated with onboard and other revenues including the costs of products sold onboard our ships vacation protection insurance premiums costs associated with pre and postcruise tours and related credit card fees as well as the minimal costs associated with concession revenues as the costs are mostly incurred by thirdparty concessionaires and costs incurred for the procurement and management related services we perform on behalf of our unconsolidated affiliates 

• payroll and related expenses  which consist of costs for shipboard personnel costs associated with our shoreside personnel are included in marketing selling and administrative expenses  

• food expenses  which include food costs for both guests and crew 

• fuel expenses  which include fuel and related delivery storage and emission consumable costs and the financial impact of fuel swap agreements and 

• other operating expenses  which consist primarily of operating costs such as repairs and maintenance port costs that do not vary with passenger head counts vessel related insurance entertainment and gains andor losses related to the sale of our ships if any 

we do not allocate payroll and related expenses food expenses fuel expenses or other operating expenses to the expense categories attributable to passenger ticket revenues or onboard and other revenues since they are incurred to provide the total cruise vacation experience 

selected operational and financial metrics 

we utilize a variety of operational and financial metrics which are defined below to evaluate our performance and financial condition as discussed in more detail herein certain of these metrics are nongaap financial measures these nongaap financial measures are provided along with the related gaap financial measures as we believe they provide useful information to investors as a supplement to our consolidated financial statements which are prepared and presented in accordance with gaap the presentation of nongaap financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap 

adjusted loss earnings per share adjusted eps represents adjusted net loss income attributable to royal caribbean cruises ltd divided by weighted average shares outstanding or by diluted weighted average shares outstanding as applicable we believe that this nongaap measure is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis 

adjusted net loss income represents net loss income less net income attributable to noncontrolling interest excluding certain items that we believe adjusting for is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis for the periods presented these items included i asset impairment and credit losses recorded in 2020 as a result of the impact of covid19 ii equity investment impairment charges recorded in the first quarter of 2020 as a result of the impact of covid19 iii currency translation losses recognized in connection with the ships that were previously chartered to pullmantur iv the estimated cash refund expected to be paid to pullmantur guests and other expenses incurred as part of the pullmantur sa reorganization v restructuring charges incurred in relation to the reduction in our us workforce and other initiatives expenses in 2020 and the reorganization of our international sales and marketing structure primarily in 2019 vi the amortization of noncash debt discount on our convertible notes vii loss on the extinguishment of debt viii the amortization of the silversea cruises intangible assets resulting from the 2018 acquisition ix the noncontrolling interest adjustment to exclude the impact of the contractual accretion requirements associated with the put option held by heritage cruise holding ltd heritage prior to the july 2020 noncontrolling interest purchase x the change in fair value in the silversea cruises contingent consideration xi net insurance recoveries or costs related to the collapse of the drydock structure at the grand bahama shipyard involving oasis of the seas xii transaction costs related to the 2018 silversea cruises acquisition xiii the impairment loss and other costs related to the exit of our tour operations business xiv the impairment loss related to skysea holding and xv the impact of the change in accounting principle related to the recognition of stockbased compensation expense from the graded attribution method to the straightline attribution method for timebased stock awards 

available passenger cruise days  apcd  is our measurement of capacity and represents double occupancy per cabin multiplied by the number of cruise days for the period which excludes canceled cruise days and drydock days we use this 

measure to perform capacity and rate analysis to identify our main noncapacity drivers that cause our cruise revenue and expenses to vary 

occupancy  in accordance with cruise vacation industry practice is calculated by dividing passenger cruise days by apcd a percentage in excess of 100 indicates that three or more passengers occupied some cabins 

passenger cruise days represent the number of passengers carried for the period multiplied by the number of days of their respective cruises 

although discussed in prior periods we did not report nor reconcile our gross yields net revenues net yields gross cruise costs net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel as defined in our annual report on form 10k for twelve months ended december 31 2019 historically we have utilized these financial metrics to measure relevant rate comparisons to other periods however our 2020 reduction in capacity and revenues and the shift in the nature of our running costs due to the suspension of our operations as a result of the covid19 pandemic covid19 do not allow for a meaningful comparison to the prior period metrics and as such these metrics have been excluded from this report 

recent developments covid19 

the disruptions to our operations resulting from covid19 have had and continue to have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations the outbreak of covid19 has resulted in an unprecedented global response to contain the spread of the disease these global efforts have resulted in travel restrictions and created significant uncertainty regarding worldwide port closures and availability of ports and destinations generally as part of the global containment effort we previously announced a voluntary suspension of our global brands’ cruise operations beginning march 13 2020 which has been extended through at least april 30 2021 for most of our cruise operations 

we continue to work with government and health authorities across the globe to address the unique public health challenges posed by covid19 and expect to restart our global cruise operation in a phased manner notably we resumed limited cruise operations outside of the us in july and september with tui cruises and hapaglloyd respectively for a limited period recently we also received approval from the singaporean government to resume sailings out of singapore as a result quantum of the seas  a ship from the royal caribbean international fleet resumed cruising from singapore in december 2020 these initial cruises are and will most likely continue to take place with reduced guest occupancy modified itineraries and enhanced health protocols developed in collaboration with governments and health authorities 

cdc framework for conditional sailing order 

on and effective as of october 30 2020 the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc issued a framework for conditional sailing order the “conditional order” that will conditionally permit cruise ship passenger operations in us waters under certain conditions and using a phased approach the conditional order replaces the cdc’s no sail order that expired on october 31 2020 and will remain in effect until the earlier of 1 the expiration of the secretary of health and human services’ declaration that covid19 constitutes a public health emergency 2 the rescission or modification by the cdc director of the conditional order based on specific public health or other considerations or 3 november 1 2021 see part i item 1 business  regulation for further details on the conditional order 

we are working with both the cdc and the healthy sail panel hsp formed in june 2020 by us and norwegian cruise line holdings ltd and composed of leading experts in relevant fields including epidemiology infectious diseases public policy and regulation engineering and general health safety to prepare and develop our plan to meet the framework for the conditional order while the conditional order represents an important step in our return to service many uncertainties remain as to the specifics timing and costs of administering and implementing the requirements of the conditional order some of which may be significant further the conditional order contemplates that the cdc may issue additional requirements through technical instructions or orders as needed and that the phases described above will be further determined based on public health considerations including the trajectory of the pandemic and the ability of cruise ship operators to successfully employ measures that mitigate the risk of covid19 based on our assessment of these conditions or for other reasons we may determine it necessary to further extend our voluntary suspension of our global brands’ cruise sailings which currently extends through at least april 30 2021 for most of our cruise operations 

update on bookings 

booking activity for the second half of 2021 is aligned with our anticipated resumption of cruises pricing on these bookings is higher than 2019 both including and excluding the dilutive impact of future cruise credits fccs while the brands are still in the process of opening for sale the remainder of their 20222023 seasons first and second quarter 2022 sailings have been open for some time cumulative advance bookings for the first half of 2022 are within historical ranges and at higher prices this was achieved with minimal sales and marketing spend which we believe highlights a strong longterm demand for cruising 

since our last quarterly filing approximately 75 of bookings made for 2021 are new and the rest are due to the redemption of fccs and our “lift  shift” program we continue to provide guests who were booked on a suspended sailing with the option to request a refund to receive an fcc or to “lift and shift” their booking to the following year 

as of december 31 2020 we had 18 billion in customer deposits of which approximately 50 are fccs and the rest are related to new bookings approximately 53 of the guests booked on cancelled sailings since our suspension of operations have requested cash refunds 

update on recent liquidity actions and ongoing uses of cash

liquidity and capital resources 

sources and uses of cash 

as a result of the covid19 impact on our business including the suspension of global sailings we have experienced a decrease in bookings and an increase in customer deposit refunds since the first quarter of 2020 which has significantly affected our liquidity and cash flow 

net cash used in provided by operating activities decreased 74 billion to cash used of 37 billion for the twelve months ended december 31 2020 compared to cash provided of 37 billion in 2019 the current disruptions to our business led to a decrease in collections from our guests as well as an increase of refunds to guests for cancelled sailings during the twelve months ended december 31 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 

net cash provided by operating activities increased 2372 million to 37 billion in 2019 compared to 35 billion in 2018 the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to an increase in proceeds from customer deposits an increase in cash receipts from onboard spending and a decrease in fuel costs in 2019 compared to 2018 additionally dividends received from unconsolidated affiliates decreased by 929 million 

net cash used in investing activities decreased 09 billion to 22 billion in 2020 compared to 31 billion in 2019 the decrease in investing activities was primarily attributable to a decrease in capital expenditures of 11 billion 

net cash used in investing activities decreased 14 billion to 31 billion in 2019 compared to 45 billion in 2018 the decrease was primarily attributable to the 9161 million of cash paid for the acquisition of silversea cruises net of cash acquired in 2018 which did not recur in 2019 and a decrease in capital expenditures of 6354 million due mostly to the delivery of two more ships in 2018 compared to 2019 partially offset by higher fleet modernization costs in 2019 compared to 2018 

net cash provided by financing activities was 93 billion in 2020 compared to net cash used in financing activities of 07 billion in 2019 the change was primarily attributable to an increase in debt proceeds of 100 billion in 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 and 14 million in proceeds from common stock issuances on 2020 these proceeds were partially offset by net repayments of commercial paper of 11 billion during the twelve months ended december 31 2020 compared to net borrowings of commercial paper of 06 billion during the same period in 2019 

net cash used by financing activities was 07 billion in 2019 compared to net cash provided in financing activities of 12 billion in 2018 the change was primarily attributable to a decrease in debt proceeds of 51 billion in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to a decrease in borrowings on our revolving credit facilities and less unsecured term loan borrowings resulting from less ship deliveries in 2019 and the financing of the acquisition of silversea cruises in 2018 this decrease in proceeds was partially offset by a decrease in repayments of debt of 29 billion and a decrease in stock repurchases of 4755 million in 2019 compared to 2018

decreased demand for cruising as a result of concerns regarding the covid19 pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have a material impact on our cash flows liquidity and financial position in order to preserve liquidity throughout the covid19 pandemic we deferred a significant portion of our planned 2020 and 2021 capital expenditures as of december 31 2020 we anticipate overall full year capital expenditures based on our existing ships on order will be approximately 21 billion for 2021 these amounts do not include any ships on order by our partner brands

8 amounts represent fees payable to sovereign guarantors in connection with certain of our export credit debt facilities and facility fees on our revolving credit facilities 

please refer to funding needs and sources below for discussion on the planned funding of the above contractual obligations 

as a normal part of our business depending on market conditions pricing and our overall growth strategy we continuously consider opportunities to enter into contracts for the building of additional ships we may also consider the sale of ships or the purchase of existing ships we continuously consider potential acquisitions and strategic alliances if any of these were to occur they would be financed through the incurrence of additional indebtedness the issuance of additional shares of equity securities or through cash flows from operations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

tui cruises has entered into various ship construction and credit agreements that include certain restrictions on each of our and tui ags ability to reduce our current ownership interest in tui cruises below 3755 through may 2033 

some of the contracts that we enter into include indemnification provisions that obligate us to make payments to the counterparty if certain events occur these contingencies generally relate to changes in taxes increased lender capital costs and other similar costs the indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms and are entered into in the normal course of business there are no stated or notional amounts included in the indemnification clauses and we are not able to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments if any under these indemnification clauses we have not been required to make any payments under such indemnification clauses in the past and under current circumstances we do not believe an indemnification obligation is probable 

we have a residual value guarantee associated with our operating lease of a terminal at port of miami in miami florida that approximates a percentage of cost of the asset as of the inception of the lease we consider the possibility of incurring costs associated with the residual value guarantee to be remote also in connection with the port of miami terminal operating lease we are required to deliver on or before july 18 2021 cash collateral in an amount equal to the lesser of our residual value guarantee or the aggregate balance of the lessors terminal construction debt estimated at 1811 million as of december 31 2020 the collateral is to be issued to an escrow agent and pledged to the benefit of the terminal construction debt lenders until all amounts due by us under the lease have been paid in full 

since the covid19 pandemic began our senior unsecured ratings from moody’s and sp have been downgraded and are currently b2 and b respectively these downgrades reduce our ability to incur secured indebtedness by reducing the amount of indebtedness that we are permitted to secure and may negatively impact our access to and cost of debt financing additionally as a result of moody’s downgrade of the silversea notes from baa3 to ba2 on august 31 2020 and sp’s downgrade of silversea cruises notes from bbb to bb on august 31 2020 certain covenants of the indenture governing the silversea notes have been reinstated on february 25 2021 sp global further downgraded the silversea cruises notes from bb to bb which had no further impact with respect to the silversea cruises’ notes 

the company also has agreements with its credit card processors relating to customer deposits received by the company for future voyages these agreements allow the credit card processors to require under certain circumstances including breach 

of the financial covenants the existence of other material adverse changes excessive chargebacks and other triggering events the company to maintain a reserve that can be satisfied by posting collateral 

executed amendments are in place for the majority of these providers waiving reserve requirements tied to breach of our financial covenants through at least march 31 2022 or september 30 2022 depending on the agreement and as such we do not anticipate any incremental collateral requirements for the processors covered by these waivers in the next 12 months we have a 750 million held in reserve with a processor where the agreement was amended in the first quarter of 2021 such that future proceeds will be withheld in reserve of which the maximum projected exposure is approximately 2000 million the amount and timing are dependent on future factors that are uncertain such as the date we return to operations volume and value of future deposits and whether we transfer our business to other processors if we require additional waivers on the credit card processing agreements and are not able to obtain them this could lead to the termination of these agreements or the trigger of reserve requirements 

certain of our surety agreements with third party providers for the benefit of certain agencies and associations that provide travel related bonds allow the surety to request collateral in the form of cash or letters of credit as of december 31 2020 we have posted collateral in the amount of approximately 91 million 

as of december 31 2020 other than the items described above we are not party to any other offbalance sheet arrangements including guarantee contracts retained or contingent interest certain derivative instruments and variable interest entities that either have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial position 

funding needs and sources 

historically we relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations drawdowns under our available credit facilities the incurrence of additional debt andor the refinancing of our existing debt and the issuance of additional shares of equity securities to fund our obligations the impact of covid19 resulted in our previously announced voluntary suspension 

of global brands cruise operations from march 13 2020 which has been extended through at least april 30 2021 for most of our cruise operations this suspension of operations has strained our sources of cash flow and liquidity causing us to take actions resulting in reductions in our operating expenses reductions in our capital expenses and new financings and other liquidity actions 

the company continues to identify and evaluate further actions to improve its liquidity these include and are not limited to further reductions in capital expenditures operating expenses and administrative costs and additional financings see further discussion on these liquidity actions at recent developments  covid19 

we have significant contractual obligations of which our debt service obligations and the capital expenditures associated with our ship purchases represent our largest funding needs as of december 31 2020 we had 116 billion of committed financing for our ships on order 

as of december 31 2020 we had 39 billion in contractual obligations due through december 31 2021 of which approximately 13 billion relates to debt maturities 09 billion relates to interest on debt and 13 billion relates to progress payments on our ship orders and the final installments payable due upon the delivery of odyssey of the seas  

as of december 31 2020 we had liquidity of 44 billion consisting of cash and cash equivalents of 37 billion and a 07 billion oneyear commitment for a 364day term loan facility  as of december 31 2020 our revolving credit facilities were fully utilized through a combination of amounts drawn and letters of credit issued under the facilities in connection with our debt covenant waiver extensions we agreed with certain of our lenders not to pay dividends or engage in stock repurchases refer to note 12 shareholders equity to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements for further information 

based on our assumptions and estimates and our financial condition we believe that the liquidity resulting from the actions mentioned above will be sufficient to fund our liquidity requirements over at least the next twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements however there is no assurance that our assumptions and estimates are accurate due to possible unknown variables related to this unprecedented suspension of our operations and as such there is inherent uncertainty in our ability to predict future liquidity requirements refer to note 1  general management’s plan and liquidity to our consolidated financial statements under item 1 financial statements for further information 

under certain of our agreements the contractual interest rate facility fee andor export credit agency fee vary with our debt rating on august 24 2020 moody’s downgraded our senior unsecured rating from ba2 to b2 and on august 31 2020 sp global downgraded our senior unsecured rating from bb to b thereby increasing the contractual interest rate facility fee and export credit agency fee across various facilities on february 25 2021 sp global further downgraded our senior unsecured rating from b to b which had no further financial impact 

if any person acquires ownership of more than 50 of our common stock or subject to certain exceptions during any 24month period a majority of our board of directors is no longer comprised of individuals who were members of our board of directors on the first day of such period we may be obligated to prepay indebtedness outstanding under our credit facilities which we may be unable to replace on similar terms our public debt securities also contain change of control provisions that would be triggered by a thirdparty acquisition of greater than 50 of our common stock coupled with a ratings downgrade if this were to occur it would have an adverse impact on our liquidity and operations 

debt covenants 

both our export credit facilities and our nonexport credit facilities contain covenants that require us among other things to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 125x and limit our net debttocapital ratio to no more than 625 and under certain facilities to maintain a minimum level of shareholders equity the fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated by dividing net cash from operations for the past four quarters by the sum of dividend payments plus scheduled principal debt payments in excess of any new financings for the past four quarters our minimum net worth and maximum net debttocapital calculations exclude the impact of accumulated other comprehensive loss on total shareholders’ equity  

as of december 31 2020 financial covenant testing on our exportcredit and nonexport credit facilities totaling 112 billion of and our credit card processing agreements was waived through the fourth quarter of 2021 following amendments to the agreements during 2020 

during the first quarter of 2021 we further amended 49 billion of our nonexport credit facilities and 62 billion of our export credit facilities and certain credit card processing agreements to extend the waiver of our financial covenants through and including at least the third quarter of 2022 

in addition pursuant to the amendments for the nonexport credit facilities we have modified the manner in which such covenants are calculated temporarily in certain cases and permanently in others as well as the levels at which our net debt to 

capitalization covenant will be tested during the period commencing immediately following the end of the waiver period and continuing through the end of 2023 

the amendments impose a monthlytested minimum liquidity covenant of 5000 million for the duration of the waiver period subject to reduction to 3500 million if we raise at least 5000 million of additional capital which can be satisfied through previously undrawn facilities in addition the amendments to the nonexport credit facilities place restrictions on paying cash dividends and effectuating share repurchases through the end of the third quarter of 2022 while the export credit facility amendments require us to prepay any deferred amounts if we elect to issue dividends or complete share repurchases as of december 31 2020 we were in compliance with the applicable minimum liquidity covenant and we estimate that we will be in compliance for at least the next twelve months 

in addition to the above during 2020 we amended our port of miami terminal a operating lease agreement to increase the lien basket in line with our debt facilities in the first quarter of 2021 we also amended this lease to obtain a financial covenant waiver through the end of the third quarter of 2022 on the same terms as apply to the nonexport credit facilities as of december 31 2020 we were in compliance with the amended covenants under the lease agreement 

any further covenant waivers may lead to increased costs increased interest rates additional restrictive covenants and other available lender protections as may be agreed with our lenders there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain additional waivers in a timely manner or on acceptable terms if we require additional waivers and are not able to obtain them or repay the debt facilities this would lead to an event of default and potential acceleration of amounts due under all of our outstanding debt and derivative contracts 

if we require additional waivers on the credit card processing agreements and are not able to obtain them this could lead to the termination of these agreements or the trigger of reserve requirements 

dividends 

during the first quarter of 2020 we declared a cash dividend on our common stock of 078 per share which was paid in the second quarter of 2020 

during the second quarter of 2020 we agreed with certain of our lenders not to pay dividends or engage in common stock repurchases for so long as our debt covenant waivers are in effect in addition in the event we declare a dividend or engage in share repurchases we will need to repay the amounts deferred under our export credit facilities as part of the principal amortization deferral provided in 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 accordingly we did not declare any additional dividends during 2020 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial instruments and other 

general 

we are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices we try to mitigate these risks through a combination of our normal operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments pursuant to our hedging practices and policies the financial impact of these hedging instruments is primarily offset by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures being hedged we achieve this by closely matching the amount term and conditions of the derivative instrument with the underlying risk being hedged although certain of our derivative financial instruments do not qualify or are not accounted for under hedge accounting our objective is not to hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes refer to note 18  fair value measurements and derivative instruments to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our longterm debt obligations including future interest payments at december 31 2020 approximately 645 of our longterm debt was effectively fixed as compared to 621 as of december 31 2019 we use interest rate swap agreements to modify our exposure to interest rate movements and to manage our interest expense 

market risk associated with our longterm fixed rate debt is the potential increase in fair value resulting from a decrease in interest rates we use interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a portion of our fixedrate debt to a floatingrate basis to manage this risk at december 31 2020 we maintained interest rate swap agreements on the following fixedrate debt instruments 



these interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as fair value hedges 

the estimated fair value of our longterm fixedrate debt at december 31 2020 was 129 billion using quoted market prices where available or using the present value of expected future cash flows which incorporates risk profile the fair value of our fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements was estimated to be an asset of 188 million as of december 31 2020 based on the present value of expected future cash flows a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates at december 31 2020 would increase the fair value of our hedged and unhedged longterm fixedrate debt by approximately 672 million and would increase the fair value of our fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements by approximately 118 million 

market risk associated with our longterm floatingrate debt is the potential increase in interest expense from an increase in interest rates we use interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a portion of our floatingrate debt to a fixedrate basis to manage this risk a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase our forecasted 2021 interest expense by approximately 594 million assuming no change in foreign currency exchange rates 

at december 31 2020 we maintained interest rate swap agreements on the following floatingrate debt instruments 



 

1 interest rate swap agreements hedging the eurodenominated term loan for harmony of the seas include euribor zerofloors matching the hedged debt euribor zerofloor amount presented is based on the exchange rate as of december 31 2020 

2 interest rate swap agreements hedging the term loan of odyssey of the seas include libor zerofloors matching the debt libor zerofloor the effective dates of the 4600 million and 1917 million interest rate swap agreements are october 2020 and october 2022 respectively the anticipated unsecured term loan for the financing of odyssey of the seas was initially expected to be drawn in october 2020 however due to the impact of covid19 to shipyard operations there is a delay in the ship delivery 

these interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges 

the fair value of our floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements was estimated to be a liability of 1545 million as of december 31 2020 based on the present value of expected future cash flows these interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to our ship construction contracts denominated in euros our foreign currency denominated debt and our international business operations on a regular basis we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and from time to time we utilize crosscurrency swap agreements and collar options to manage portions of the exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 

the estimated fair value as of december 31 2020 of our eurodenominated forward contracts associated with our ship construction contracts was a liability of 709 million based on the present value of expected future cash flows as of december 31 2020 the aggregate cost of our ships on order not including ships on order by our partner brands and the silversea cruises ships that remain contingent upon final documentation and financing was approximately 142 billion of which we had deposited 6848 million as of such date approximately 663 and 659 of the aggregate cost of the ships under construction was exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively a hypothetical 10 strengthening of the euro as of december 31 2020 assuming no changes in comparative interest rates would result in a 9412 million increase in the united states dollar cost of the foreign currency denominated ship construction contracts exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate our foreign currency forward contract agreements are accounted for as cash flow or net investment hedges depending on the designation of the related hedge 

our international business operations subject us to foreign currency exchange risk we transact business in many different foreign currencies and maintain investments in foreign operations which may expose us to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates movements in foreign currency exchange rates may affect the value of our earnings in foreign currencies and cash flows we manage most of this exposure on a consolidated basis which allows us to take advantage of any natural offsets therefore weakness in one particular currency might be offset by strengths in other currencies over time the extent to which one currency is effective as a natural offset of another currency fluctuates over time in addition some foreign currency exposures have little to no mitigating natural offsets available 

we consider our investments in our foreign operations to be denominated in relatively stable currencies and of a longterm nature as of december 31 2020 we maintained foreign currency forward contracts and designated them as hedges of a portion of our net investment in tui cruises of €2450 million or approximately 2997 million based on the exchange rate at december 31 2020 these forward currency contracts mature in october 2021 

we also address the exposure of our investments in foreign operations by denominating a portion of our debt in our subsidiaries and investments functional currencies and designating it as a hedge of these subsidiaries and investments we had designated debt as a hedge of our net investments primarily in tui cruises of approximately €2150 million or approximately 2630 million through december 31 2020 as of december 31 2019 we had designated debt as a hedge of our net investments primarily in tui cruises of approximately €3190 million or approximately 3581 million 

we have included net gains of approximately 221 million and 968 million of foreigncurrency transaction remeasurement and changes in the fair value of derivatives in the foreign currency translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive loss at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

on a regular basis we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and from time to time we utilize crosscurrency swap agreements and collar options to minimize the volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than our functional currency or the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries during 2020 we maintained an average of approximately 3640 million of these foreign currency forward contracts these instruments are not designated as hedging instruments for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 changes in the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts resulted in gains losses of approximately 190 million 14 million and 624 million respectively which offset gains losses arising from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies in those same years of 15 million 04 million and 576 million respectively these changes were recognized in earnings within other income expense in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss 

fuel price risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates primarily to the consumption of fuel on our ships fuel cost net of the financial impact of fuel swap agreements as a percentage of our total revenues was approximately 168 in 2020 64 in 2019 and 75 in 2018 we use fuel swap agreements to mitigate the financial impact of fluctuations in fuel prices 

as of december 31 2020 we had fuel swap agreements to pay fixed prices for fuel with an aggregate notional amount of approximately 5350 million maturing through 2024 these fuel swap agreements are generally accounted for as cash flow hedges the fuel swap agreements designated as hedges of projected fuel purchases represented 40 of our projected 2021 fuel requirements 23 of our projected 2022 fuel requirements and 5 of our projected 2023 fuel requirements the current suspension of the cruise operations due to the covid19 pandemic and our 2020 and expected 2021 ship disposals resulted in reductions to our forecasted fuel consumption as of december 31 2020 the company had outstanding fuel swaps of 229850 and 14650 metric tons maturing in 2021 and 2022 respectively that no longer hedge forecasted fuel consumption the estimated fair value of our fuel swap agreements at december 31 2020 was estimated to be a liability of 880 million we estimate that a hypothetical 10 increase in our weightedaverage fuel price from that experienced during the year ended december 31 2020 would increase our forecasted 2021 fuel cost by approximately 150 million net of the impact of fuel swap agreements

as we grow our business globally our sale arrangements with travel agents may vary for instance although our direct business is growing at a rapid pace sale arrangements through travel agent charter and group sales are proportionately higher in the china market than in our other markets which are primarily through retail agency and direct sales

we are members of four protection and indemnity pi clubs which are part of a worldwide group of 13 pi clubs known as the international group of pi clubs the “ig” liabilities costs and expenses for illness and injury to crew guest injury pollution and other thirdparty claims in connection with our cruise activities are covered by our pi clubs subject to the clubs’ rules and the limits of coverage determined by the ig pi coverage provided by the clubs is on a mutual basis and we are subject to additional premium calls in the event of a catastrophic loss incurred by any member of the 13 pi clubs whereby the reinsurance limits purchased by the ig are exhausted we are also subject to additional premium calls based on investment and underwriting shortfalls experienced by our own individual insurers

we do not carry business interruption insurance for our ships based on our evaluation of the risks involved and protective measures already in place as compared to the cost of insurance 

all insurance coverage is subject to certain limitations exclusions and deductible levels in addition in certain circumstances we either selfinsure or coinsure a portion of these risks premiums charged by insurance carriers including carriers in the maritime insurance industry increase or decrease from time to time and tend to be cyclical in nature these cycles are impacted both by our own loss experience and by losses incurred in direct and reinsurance markets we historically have been able to obtain insurance coverage in amounts and at premiums we have deemed to be commercially acceptable no assurance can be given that affordable and secure insurance markets will be available to us in the future particularly for war risk insurance

we own a number of registered trademarks related to the royal caribbean international celebrity cruises azamara and silversea cruises cruise brands the registered trademarks include the name “royal caribbean international” and its crown and anchor logo the name “celebrity cruises” and its “x” logo the name “azamara” and its open world and star logo the name “silversea cruises” and its logo and the names of various cruise ships ship venues and other marketing programs we believe our largest brands trademarks are widely recognized throughout the world and have considerable value the duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country however trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use andor their registrations are properly maintained 

regulation 

our ships are regulated by various international national state and local laws regulations and treaties in force in the jurisdictions in which they operate in addition our ships are registered in the bahamas malta or in the case of our ships operating in the galapagos islands ecuador each ship is subject to regulations issued by its country of registry including regulations issued pursuant to international treaties governing the safety of our ships guests and crew as well as environmental protection each country of registry conducts periodic inspections to verify compliance with these regulations as discussed more fully below ships operating out of ports of call around the world are also subject to inspection by the maritime authorities of that country for compliance with international treaties and local regulations additionally ships operating out of the united states ports are subject to inspection by the united states coast guard for compliance with international treaties and by the united states public health service for sanitary and health conditions our ships are also subject to similar inspections pursuant to the laws and regulations of various other countries our ships visit 

we believe that we are in material compliance with all the regulations applicable to our ships and that we have all licenses necessary to conduct our business health safety security environmental and financial responsibility issues are and we believe will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant government authorities in the united states and internationally from time to time various regulatory and legislative changes may be proposed that could impact our operations and subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 

safety and security regulations 

our ships are required to comply with international safety standards defined in the international convention for safety of life at sea “solas” which among other things establishes requirements for ship design structural features materials construction lifesaving equipment and safe management and operation of ships to ensure guest and crew safety the solas standards are revised from time to time and changes are incorporated into the 

table of c ontents 

operation of our ships compliance with these modified standards have not historically had a material effect on our operating costs solas incorporates the international safety management code “ism code” which provides an international standard for the safe management and operation of ships and for pollution prevention the ism code is mandatory for all vessels including passenger vessel operators 

all of our operations and ships are regularly audited by various national authorities and we are required to maintain the relevant certificates of compliance with the ism code 

our ships are subject to various security requirements including the international ship and port facility security code “isps code” which is part of solas and the us maritime transportation security act of 2002 “mtsa” which applies to ships that operate in us ports in order to satisfy these security requirements we implement security measures conduct vessel security assessments and develop security plans the security plans for all of our ships have been submitted to and approved by the recognized security organization on behalf of the ships flag state and are in compliance with the isps code and the mtsa 

the cruise vessel security and safety act of 2010 which applies to passenger vessels which embark or include port stops within the united states requires the implementation of certain safety design features as well as the establishment of practices for the reporting of and dealing with allegations of crime the cruise industry supported this legislation and we believe that our internal standards are generally as strict or stricter than the law requires some provisions of the act call for regulations which have not been finalized we do not expect the pending regulations will have a material impact to our operations 

environmental regulations 

we are subject to various international and national laws and regulations relating to environmental protection under such laws and regulations we are generally prohibited from discharging materials other than food waste into the waterways we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations from time to time environmental and other regulators consider more stringent regulations which may affect our operations and increase our compliance costs we believe that the impact of ships on the global environment will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world and accordingly may subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future including the items described below 

our ships are subject to the international maritime organization’s ‘‘imo’’ regulations under the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships the ‘‘marpol regulations’’ and the international convention for the control and management of ships ballast water and sediments ballast water management convention in addition to other regional and national regulations such as eu directives and the us vessel general permit which includes requirements designed to minimize pollution by oil sewage garbage air emissions and the transfer of nonnativenonindigenous species we have obtained the relevant international compliance certificates relating to oil sewage air pollution prevention and ballast water for all of our ships 

the marpol regulations imposed reduced global limitations on the sulfur content of emissions emitted by ships operating worldwide to 05 as of january 1 2020 which was reduced from 35  we do not expect that this increased limitation will have a material impact to our results of operations largely due to a number of mitigating steps we have taken over the last several years including equipping all of our new ships delivered during or after 2014 with advanced emissions purification aep systems covering all engines and actively developing and installing aep systems on the majority of our remaining fleet 

the marpol regulations also establish special emission control areas ‘‘ecas’’ with additional stringent limitations on sulfur emissions in these areas there are four established ecas that restrict sulfur emissions the baltic sea the north seaenglish channel certain waters surrounding the north american coast and the waters surrounding puerto rico and the us virgin islands the “caribbean eca” ships operating in these sulfur ecas have been required to reduce their emissions sulfur content to 01 this reduction has not had a significant impact on our results of operations to date due to the mitigating steps described above 

we continue to implement our aep system strategy for both our ships on order and our existing fleet as our new ships are delivered and additional existing ships are retrofitted with aep systems they will provide us with additional operational and deployment flexibility 

table of c ontents 

additionally all new ships operating within the north american and us caribbean sea eca that began construction after january 1 2016 are required to meet more stringent nitrogen oxide emission limits we comply with these rules for those relevant ships in service as an added measure all of our ships under construction are being built to comply with these rules the rules have not had and are not expected to have a significant impact to our operations or costs 

effective july 1 2015 the european commission adopted legislation that requires cruise ship operators with ships visiting ports in the european union to monitor and report on the ship’s annual carbon dioxide emissions starting in 2018 additionally in 2019 the imos monitoring and reporting system imo data and collection system which is applicable to all ship itineraries entered into force while compliance with these regulations did not materially impact our costs or results of operations the legislations contemplate further obligations and restrictions which could ultimately result in additional costs or charges associated with carbon dioxide emissions 

the imo ballast water management convention which came in effect in 2017 requires ships that carry and discharge ballast water to meet specific discharge standards by installing ballast water treatment systems by 2023 compliance with this regulation has not had a material effect on our results of operations and we do not expect the continuing compliance with this regulation to have a material effect on our results of operations 

refer to item 1a risk factors  environmental labor health and safety financial responsibility and other maritime regulations could affect operations and increase costs for further discussion of the risks associated with the regulations discussed above  

consumer financial responsibility regulations 

we are required to obtain certificates from the united states federal maritime commission relating to our ability to satisfy liability in cases of nonperformance of obligations to guests as well as casualty and personal injury as a condition to obtaining the required certificates we generally arrange through our insurers for the provision of surety for our shipoperating companies the required amount is currently 320 million per operator and is subject to additional consumer price index based adjustments 

we are also required by the united kingdom norway finland and the baltics to establish our financial responsibility for any liability resulting from the nonperformance of our obligations to guests from these jurisdictions in the united kingdom we are currently required by the association of british travel agents to provide performance bonds totaling approximately £82 million additionally we were required by the civil aviation authority to provide performance bonds totaling £8 million the norwegian travel guarantee fund requires us to maintain performance bonds in varying amounts during the course of the year to cover our financial responsibility in norway finland and the baltics these amounts ranged from nok 32 million to nok 57 million during 2019 

certain other jurisdictions also require that we establish financial responsibility to our guests resulting from the nonperformance of our obligations however the related amounts do not have a material effect on our costs 

taxation of the company 

the following is a summary of our principal taxes exemptions and special regimes in addition to or instead of income taxation virtually all jurisdictions where our ships call impose some tax or fee or both based on guest headcount tonnage or some other measure we also collect and remit value added tax vat or sales tax in many jurisdictions where we operate 

our consolidated operations are primarily foreign corporations engaged in the owning and operating of passenger cruise ships in international transportation 

us income taxation 

the following is a discussion of the application of the us federal and state income tax laws to us and is based on the current provisions of the us internal revenue code treasury department regulations administrative rulings court decisions and the relevant state tax laws regulations rulings and court decisions of the states where we have business operations all of the foregoing is subject to change and any such change could affect the accuracy of this discussion

application of section 883 of the internal revenue code 

we celebrity cruises inc and silversea cruises ltd are engaged in a trade or business in the united states and many of our shipowning subsidiaries depending upon the itineraries of their ships receive income from sources within the united states additionally our united kingdom tonnage tax company is a shipoperating company classified as a disregarded entity for us federal income tax purposes that may earn us source income under section 883 of the internal revenue code certain foreign corporations may exclude from gross income and effectively from branch profits tax as such earnings do not give rise to effectively connected earnings and profits us source income derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships including income from the leasing of such ships 

a foreign corporation will qualify for the benefits of section 883 if in relevant part 1 the foreign country in which the foreign corporation is organized grants an equivalent exemption to corporations organized in the united states and 2 the stock of the corporation or the direct or indirect corporate parent thereof is “primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market” in the united states in the opinion of our us tax counsel drinker biddle  reath llp based on the representations and assumptions set forth in that opinion we celebrity cruises inc silversea cruises ltd and relevant shipowning subsidiaries with us source shipping income qualify for the benefits of section 883 because we and each of those subsidiaries are incorporated in liberia or bahamas which are qualifying countries and our common stock is primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market in the united states ie we are a publicly traded corporation if in the future 1 liberia or bahamas no longer qualify as equivalent exemption jurisdictions and we do not reincorporate in a jurisdiction that does qualify for the exemption or 2 we fail to qualify as a publicly traded corporation we and all of our shipowning or operating subsidiaries that rely on section 883 to exclude qualifying income from gross income would be subject to us federal income tax on their us source shipping income and income from activities incidental thereto 

we believe that most of our income and the income of our shipowning subsidiaries including our uk tonnage tax company which is considered a division for us tax purposes is derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships and therefore is exempt from taxation under section 883 

regulations under section 883 list activities that are not considered by the internal revenue service to be incidental to the international operation of ships including the sale of air and land transportation shore excursions and pre and postcruise tours our income from these activities that is earned from sources within the united states will be subject to us taxation 

taxation in the absence of an exemption under section 883 

if we the operator of our vessels celebrity cruises inc silversea cruises ltd or our shipowning subsidiaries were to fail to meet the requirements of section 883 of the internal revenue code or if the provision was repealed then as explained below such companies would be subject to us income taxation on a portion of their income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships 

because we celebrity cruises inc and silversea cruises ltd conduct a trade or business in the united states we celebrity cruises inc and silversea cruises ltd would be taxable at regular corporate rates on our separate company taxable income ie without regard to the income of our shipowning subsidiaries on income which is effectively connected with our us trade or business generally only income from us sources in addition if any of our earnings and profits effectively connected with our us trade or business were withdrawn or were deemed to have been withdrawn from our us trade or business those withdrawn amounts would be subject to a “branch profits” tax at the rate of 30 we celebrity cruises inc and silversea cruises ltd would also be potentially subject to tax on portions of certain interest paid by us at rates of up to 30 

if section 883 were not available to our shipowning subsidiaries each such subsidiary would be subject to a special 4 tax on its us source gross transportation income if any each year because it does not have a fixed place of business in the united states and its income is derived from the leasing of a ship 

table of c ontents 

other united states taxation 

we celebrity cruises inc and silversea cruises ltd earn us source income from activities not considered incidental to international shipping the tax on such income is not material to our results of operation for all years presented 

state taxation 

we celebrity cruises inc silversea cruises ltd and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various us state income taxes which are generally imposed on each state’s portion of the us source income subject to federal income taxes additionally the state of alaska subjects an allocated portion of the total income of companies doing business in alaska and certain other affiliated companies to alaska corporate state income taxes and also imposes a 33 tax on adjusted gross income from onboard gambling activities conducted in alaska waters this did not have a material impact to our results of operations for all years presented 

2017 tax cuts and jobs act 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act was signed into law among other things the new legislation reduced the federal corporate income tax rate to 21 from 35 resulting in an immaterial benefit in 2017 related to the reduction of our us deferred tax liability although there are a number of provisions which apply to us there was no material impact to our overall tax expense as a result of the legislation 

maltese and spanish income taxation 

effective july 31 2016 we sold 51 of our interest in pullmantur holdings sl pullmantur holdings the parent company of the pullmantur brand we account for our retained investment under the equity method of accounting there was no tax impact to us as a result of this sale transaction the pullmantur group continues to be subject to the tax laws of spain and malta among others 

under the sale agreement we remain responsible for presale tax matters with respect to years that are still open under the statute of limitations 

united kingdom income taxation 

during the year ended december 31 2019 we operated 16 ships under the united kingdom tonnage tax regime “uk tonnage tax” 

companies subject to uk tonnage tax pay a corporate tax on a notional profit determined with reference to the net tonnage of qualifying vessels the requirements for a company to qualify for the uk tonnage tax regime include being subject to uk corporate income tax operating qualifying ships which are strategically and commercially managed in the united kingdom and fulfilling a seafarer training requirement 

relevant shipping profits include income from the operation of qualifying ships and from shipping related activities our uk income from nonshipping activities which do not qualify under the uk tonnage tax regime and which are not considered significant remain subject to regular uk corporate income tax 

chinese taxation 

our uk tonnage tax company operates ships in international transportation in china the income earned from this operation is exempt from taxation in china under the ukchina double tax treaty and other circulars addressing indirect taxes changes to or failure to qualify for the treaty or circular could cause us to lose the benefits provided which would have a material impact on our results of operations our chinese income from nonshipping activities or from shipping activities not qualifying for treaty or circular protection and which are considered insignificant remain subject to chinese taxation 

other taxation 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to valueadded and other indirect taxes most of which are reclaimable zerorated or exempt

 item 1a risk factors 

the risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k are important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historical results it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks there may be additional risks that we consider not to be material or which are not known and any of these risks could have the effects set forth below   the ordering of the risk factors set forth below is not intended to reflect any company indication of priority or likelihood see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a cautionary note regarding forwardlooking statements 

adverse worldwide economic or other conditions could reduce the demand for cruises and passenger spending adversely impacting our operating results cash flows and financial condition including potentially impairing the value of our ships and other assets 

the demand for cruises is affected by international national and local economic conditions weak or uncertain economic conditions impact consumer confidence and pose a risk as vacationers may postpone or reduce discretionary spending this in turn may result in cruise booking slowdowns decreased cruise prices and lower onboard revenues given the global nature of our business we are exposed to many different economies and our business could be hurt by challenging conditions in any of our markets any significant deterioration of international national or local economic conditions including those resulting from geopolitical events andor international disputes could result in a prolonged period of booking slowdowns depressed cruise prices andor reduced onboard revenues 

fears of terrorist attacks war and other hostilities could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

events such as terrorist attacks war or warlike conditions conflicts domestic or crossborder civil unrest and other hostilities including an escalation in the frequency or severity of incidents and the resulting political instability travel restrictions and advisories and concerns over safety and security aspects of traveling or the fear of any of the foregoing have had and could have in the future a significant adverse impact on demand and pricing in the travel and vacation industry in view of our global operations we are susceptible to a wide range of adverse events these events could also result in additional security measures taken by local authorities which may potentially impact access to ports andor destinations 

our operating costs could increase due to market forces and economic or geopolitical factors beyond our control 

our operating costs including fuel food payroll and benefits airfare taxes insurance and security costs are all subject to increases due to market forces and economic or geopolitical conditions or other factors beyond our control increases in these operating costs could adversely affect our profitability 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates fuel prices and interest rates could affect our financial results 

we are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates fuel prices and interest rates significant changes in any of the foregoing could have a material impact on our financial results net of the impact of our hedging activities and natural offsets our operating results have been and will continue to be impacted often significantly by changes in each of these factors the value of our earnings in foreign currencies is adversely impacted by a strong united states dollar in addition any significant increase in fuel prices could materially and adversely affect our business as fuel prices not only impact our fuel costs but also some of our other expenses such as crew travel freight and commodity prices mandatory fuel restrictions such as the international maritime organizations 2020 low sulphur regulation imo 2020 may also create uncertainty related to the price and availability of certain fuel types potentially impacting operating costs and the value of our related hedging instruments also a significant increase in interest rates could materially impact the cost of our floating rate debt furthermore regulatory changes such as the announcement of the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority to phase out libor by the end of 2021 may adversely affect our portfolio of floatingrate debt and interest rate derivatives if libor ceases to exist we may need to renegotiate any credit agreements or interest rate derivatives agreements extending beyond 2021 that utilize libor as a factor in determining the interest rate or hedge rate which could adversely impact our cost of debt 

see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” and “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ” for more information 

table of c ontents 

conducting business globally may result in increased costs and other risks 

we operate our business globally operating internationally exposes us to a number of risks including increased exposure to a wider range of regional and local economic conditions volatile local political conditions potential changes in duties and taxes including changing andor uncertain interpretations of existing tax laws and regulations required compliance with additional laws and policies affecting cruising vacation or maritime businesses or governing the operations of foreignbased companies currency fluctuations interest rate movements difficulties in operating under local business environments port quality and availability in certain regions us and global antibribery laws or regulations imposition of trade barriers and restrictions on repatriation of earnings 

our future growth strategies increasingly depend on the growth and sustained profitability of certain international markets such as china some factors that will be critical to our success in developing these markets may be different than those affecting our moreestablished north american and european markets in the chinese market in particular our future success depends on our ability to continue to raise awareness of our products evolve the available distribution channels and adapt our offerings to best suit the chinese consumer china’s economy differs from the economies of other developed countries in many respects and as the legal and regulatory system in china continues to evolve there may be greater uncertainty as to the interpretation and enforcement of applicable laws and regulations 

operating globally also exposes us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal regulatory and tax requirements in many parts of the world including countries in which we operate practices in the local business communities might not conform to international business standards we must adhere to policies designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance as well as applicable laws and regulations however we might not be successful in ensuring that our employees agents representatives and other third parties with whom we associate throughout the world properly adhere to them failure by us our employees or any of these third parties to adhere to our policies or applicable laws or regulations could result in penalties sanctions damage to our reputation and related costs which in turn could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows 

we have operations in and source passengers from the united kingdom and the european union on january 31 2020 the united kingdom withdrew from the european union and immediately entered an 11month transition period uncertainty during the transition period could lead to adverse effects on the economy of the united kingdom including the value of the british pound and the other economies in which we operate making it more difficult to source passengers from these regions additionally if the withdrawal is not executed effectively it could adversely affect tax legal and regulatory regimes to which our business in the region is subject the withdrawal could also among other potential outcomes disrupt the free movement of goods services and people between the united kingdom and the european union if not executed effectively 

as a global operator our business may be also impacted by changes in us policy or priorities in areas such as trade immigration andor environmental or labor regulations among others depending on the nature and scope of any such changes they could impact our domestic and international business operations any such changes and any international response to them could potentially introduce new barriers to passenger or crew travel andor cross border transactions impact our guest experience andor increase our operating costs 

if we are unable to address these risks adequately our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected including potentially impairing the value of our ships and other assets 

changes in us foreign travel policy may affect our results of operations 

changes in us foreign policy could result in the imposition of travel restrictions or travel bans on us persons to certain countries or result in the imposition of us rules regulations or legislation that could expose us to penalties or claims of monetary damages the timing and scope of these changes are unpredictable and they could cause us to cancel scheduled sailings possibly on short notice or could result in possible litigation against us this in turn could decrease our revenue increase our operating costs and otherwise impair our profitability for instance in june 2019 the us government announced that cruise ships would no longer be allowed to travel between the us and cuba this required us to change our high yielding cuba sailings on short notice which impacted our earnings moreover in may 2019 the us government activated title iii of the cuban liberty and solidarity libertad act of 1996 popularly known as the helmsburton act this allowed certain individuals 

table of c ontents 

whose property was confiscated by the cuban government to sue in us courts anyone who traffics in the property in question the activation of title iii has resulted in litigation against us and others in the tourism industry 

price increases for commercial airline service for our guests or major changes or reduction in commercial airline service andor availability could adversely impact the demand for cruises and undermine our ability to provide reasonably priced vacation packages to our guests 

many of our guests depend on scheduled commercial airline services to transport them to or from the ports where our cruises embark or disembark increases in the price of airfare would increase the overall price of the cruise vacation to our guests which may adversely impact demand for our cruises in addition changes in the availability of commercial airline services could adversely affect our guests’ ability to obtain air travel as well as our ability to transfer our guests to or from our cruise ships which could adversely affect our results of operations 

incidents on ships at port facilities land destinations andor affecting the cruise vacation industry in general and the associated negative media coverage and publicity could affect our reputation and impact our sales and results of operations 

the ownership andor operation of cruise ships private destinations port facilities and shore excursions involves the risk of accidents illnesses mechanical failures environmental incidents and other incidents which may bring into question safety health security and vacation satisfaction and can negatively impact our sales operations and reputation incidents involving cruise ships and in particular the safety health and security of guests and crew and the media coverage thereof have impacted and could in the future impact demand for our cruises and pricing in the industry our reputation and our business could also be damaged by negative publicity regarding the cruise industry in general including publicity regarding the spread of contagious disease overtourism in key ports and destinations and the potentially adverse environmental impacts of cruising the considerable expansion in the use of social and digital media over recent years has compounded the potential scope and reach of any negative publicity if any such incident or news cycle occurs during a time of high seasonal demand the effect could disproportionately impact our results of operations for the year in addition incidents involving cruise ships may result in additional costs to our business increasing government or other regulatory oversight and in certain cases potential litigation 

significant weather climate events andor natural disasters could adversely impact our business and results from operations 

natural disasters eg earthquakes weather andor climate events including hurricanes and typhoons could impact our source markets and operations resulting in travel restrictions guest cancellations an inability to source our crew or our provisions and supplies from certain places we are often forced to alter itineraries and occasionally cancel a cruise or a series of cruises or to redeploy our ships due to these types of events which could have an adverse effect on our sales operating costs and profitability in the current and future periods increases in the frequency severity or duration of these types of events could exacerbate their impact and cause further disruption to our operations or make certain destinations less desirable or unavailable impacting our revenues and profitability further any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and on industry performance 

disease outbreaks and an increase in concern about the risk of illness could adversely impact our business and results from operations 

disease outbreaks and increased concern related to illness when travelling to from and on our ships could cause a drop in demand for cruises guest cancellations travel restrictions an unavailability of ports andor destinations cruise cancellations ship redeployments and an inability to source our crew provisions or supplies from certain places the recent coronavirus outbreak is currently having these impacts on our operations and given its fluid and developing nature has made it extremely difficult for us to forecast the impact it could have on our future operations for instance the resulting measures taken by china and other countries to contain the disease including travel restrictions have resulted in the cancellation or itinerary modification of an increasing number of our cruises in southeast asia in addition our imposition of measures to protect our guests and crew including denying boarding to those that have traveled from to or through mainland china or hong kong has caused us to cancel cruise bookings or restrict certain guests from booking our cruises all of these issues are having and are likely to continue to have a material impact on our bookings operations and our overall financial performance 

table of c ontents 

an increase in capacity worldwide or excess capacity in a particular market could adversely impact our cruise sales andor pricing 

although our ships can be redeployed cruise sales andor pricing may be impacted by the introduction of new ships into the marketplace reductions in cruise capacity overall market growth and deployment decisions of ourselves and our competitors as of december 31 2019 a total of 67 new ships with approximately 159000 berths are on order for delivery through 2024 in the cruise industry the further net growth in capacity from these new ships and future orders without an increase in the cruise industry’s demand andor share of the vacation market could depress cruise prices and impede our ability to achieve yield improvement 

in addition to the extent that we or our competitors deploy ships to a particular itineraryregion and the resulting capacity in that region exceeds the demand we may lower pricing and profitability may be lower than anticipated this risk exists in emerging cruise markets where capacity has grown rapidly over the past few years and in mature markets where excess capacity is typically redeployed any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition including potentially impairing the value of our ships and other assets 

unavailability of ports of call may adversely affect our results of operations  

we believe that port destinations are a major reason why guests choose to go on a particular cruise or on a cruise vacation the availability of ports and destinations is affected by a number of factors including industry demand and competition for key ports and destinations existing capacity constraints constraints related to the size of certain ships security financial limitations on port development exclusivity arrangements that ports may have with our competitors geopolitical developments and local governmental regulations in addition fuel costs may adversely impact the destinations on certain of our itineraries 

increased demand and competition for key ports of call or destinations limitations on the availability or feasibility of use of specific ports of call andor constraints on the availability of shore excursions and other service providers at such ports or destinations could adversely affect our results of operations 

growing antitourism sentiments and environmental concerns related to cruising could adversely impact our operations 

certain ports and destinations are facing a surge of both cruise and noncruise tourism which in certain cases has fueled antitourism sentiments and related countermeasures to limit the volume of tourists allowed in these destinations in certain destinations countermeasures to limit the volume of tourists are being contemplated andor put into effect including proposed limits on cruise ships and cruise passengers for example effective 2020 the local government of dubrovnik croatia will cap the number of cruise ships that can dock each day to two and the number of corresponding passengers similar existing and potential restrictions in ports and destinations such as venice and barcelona could limit the itinerary and destination options we can offer our passengers going forward some environmental groups have also generated negative publicity about the environmental impact of the cruise vacation industry and are advocating for more stringent regulation of ship emissions at berth and at sea these antitourism sentiments and growing environmental scrutiny of the cruise industry and any related countermeasures could adversely impact our operations and financial results and subject us to increasing compliance costs 

our reliance on shipyards their subcontractors and our suppliers to implement our newbuild and ship upgrade programs and to repair and maintain our ships exposes us to risks which if realized could adversely impact our business 

we rely on shipyards their subcontractors and our suppliers to effectively construct our new ships and to repair maintain and upgrade our existing ships on a timely basis and in a cost effective manner there are a limited number of shipyards with the capability and capacity to build repair maintain andor upgrade our ships 

increased demand for available new construction slots andor continued consolidation in the cruise shipyard industry could impact our ability to 1 construct new ships when and as planned 2 cause us to continue to commit to new ship orders earlier than we have historically done so andor 3 result in stronger bargaining power on the part of the shipyards and the export credit agencies providing financing for the project current market conditions characterized by limited shipyard capacity high demand for shipyard and subcontractor resources and the growing application of advanced technologies to newbuilds eg lng could cause delays in ship deliveries and 

table of c ontents 

scheduled drydocks across the industry our inability to timely and costeffectively procure new capacity and the potential delay in ship deliveries andor scheduled drydocks or modernizations could have a significant negative impact on our future business plans and results of operations 

building repairing maintaining andor upgrading a ship is also sophisticated work that involves significant risks in addition the prices of labor andor various commodities that are used in the construction of ships can be subject to volatile price changes including the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates shipyards their subcontractors andor our suppliers may encounter financial technical or design problems when doing these jobs if materialized these problems could impact the timely delivery or costs of new ships or the ability of shipyards to repair and upgrade our fleet in accordance with our needs or expectations in addition delays mechanical faults andor unforeseen incidents such as the collapse of the drydock structure at the grand bahama shipyard involving oasis of the seas may result in cancellation of cruises or in more severe situations new ship orders or necessitate unscheduled drydocks and repairs of ships these events and any related adverse publicity could result in lost revenue increased operating expenses or both and thus adversely affect our results of operations 

we may lose business to competitors throughout the vacation market  

we operate in the vacation market and cruising is one of many alternatives for people choosing a vacation we therefore risk losing business not only to other cruise lines but also to other vacation operators which provide other leisure options including hotels resorts internetbased alternative lodging sites and package holidays and tours 

we face significant competition from other cruise lines on the basis of cruise pricing travel agent preference and also in terms of the nature of ships services and destinations that we offer to guests our principal competitors within the cruise vacation industry include carnival corporation  plc which owns among others aida cruises carnival cruise line costa cruises cunard line holland america line po cruises princess cruises and seabourn disney cruise line msc cruises and norwegian cruise line holdings ltd which owns norwegian cruise line oceania cruises and regent seven seas cruises our revenues are sensitive to the actions of other cruise lines in many areas including pricing scheduling capacity and promotions which can have a substantial adverse impact not only on our revenues but on overall industry revenues 

in the event that we do not effectively market or differentiate our cruise brands from our competitors or otherwise compete effectively with other vacation alternatives and new or existing cruise companies our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

we may not be able to obtain sufficient financing or capital for our needs or may not be able to do so on terms that are acceptable or consistent with our expectations 

to fund our capital expenditures including new ship orders operations and scheduled debt payments we have historically relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations drawdowns under available credit facilities the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the sale of equity or debt securities in private or public securities markets any circumstance or event which leads to a decrease in consumer cruise spending such as worsening global economic conditions or significant incidents impacting the cruise industry could negatively affect our operating cash flows see “ adverse worldwide economic or other conditions… ” and “ incidents or adverse publicity concerning our ships andor passengers or the cruise vacation industry…” for more information 

although we believe we can access sufficient liquidity to fund our operations investments and obligations as expected there can be no assurances to that effect our ability to access additional funding as and when needed our ability to timely refinance andor replace our outstanding debt securities and credit facilities on acceptable terms and our cost of funding will depend upon numerous factors including but not limited to the vibrancy of the financial markets our financial performance the performance of our industry in general and the size scope and timing of our financial needs in addition even where financing commitments have been secured significant disruptions in the capital and credit markets could cause our banking and other counterparties to breach their contractual obligations to us this could include failures of banks or other financial service companies to fund required borrowings under our loan agreements or to pay us amounts that may become due or return collateral that is refundable under our derivative contracts for hedging of fuel prices interest rates and foreign currencies or other agreements if any of the foregoing occurs it may have a negative impact on our cash flows including our ability to meet our obligations our results of operations and our financial condition 

table of c ontents 

our liquidity could be adversely impacted if we are unable to satisfy the covenants required by our credit facilities 

our debt agreements contain covenants including covenants restricting our and their ability to take certain actions and financial covenants our ability to maintain our credit facilities may also be impacted by changes in our ownership base more specifically we may be required to prepay our bank financing facilities if any person acquires ownership of more than 50 of our common stock or subject to certain exceptions during any 24month period a majority of our board of directors is no longer comprised of individuals who were members of our board of directors on the first day of such period our public debt securities also contain change of control provisions that would be triggered by a thirdparty acquisition of greater than 50 of our common stock coupled with a ratings downgrade 

failure to comply with the terms of these debt facilities could result in an event of default generally if an event of default under any debt agreement occurs then pursuant to cross default acceleration clauses our outstanding debt and derivative contract payables could become due andor terminated in addition in such events our credit card processors could hold back payments to create a reserve we cannot provide assurances that we would have sufficient liquidity to repay or the ability to refinance the debt if such amounts were accelerated upon an event of default 

if we are unable to appropriately balance our cost management and capital allocation strategies with our goal of satisfying guest expectations it may adversely impact our business success 

our goals call for us to provide high quality products and deliver high quality services there can be no assurance that we can successfully balance these goals with our cost management and capital allocation strategies our business also requires us to make capital allocation decisions across a broad scope of investment options with varying return profiles and time horizons for value realization these include significant capital investment decisions such as ordering new ships upgrading our existing fleet enhancing our technology andor data capabilities and expanding our portfolio of landbased assets based on expected market preferences competition and projected demand there can be no assurance that our strategies will be successful which could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations investments in older tonnage in particular run the risk of not meeting expected returns and diluting related asset values 

our attempts to expand our business into new markets and new ventures may not be successful 

we opportunistically seek to grow our business through among other things expansion into new destinations or source markets and establishment of new ventures complementary to our current offerings these attempts to expand our business increase the complexity of our business require significant levels of investment and can strain our management personnel operations and systems there can be no assurance that these business expansion efforts will develop as anticipated or that we will succeed and if we do not we may be unable to recover our investment which could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks associated with our development and operation of key landbased destination projects may adversely impact our business or results of operations 

we have invested and will continue to invest either directly or indirectly through joint ventures and partnerships in a growing portfolio of key landbased projects including port and terminal facilities private destinations and multibrand destination projects these investments can increase our exposure to certain key risks depending on the scope location and the ownership and management structure of these projects these risks include susceptibility to weather events exposure to local politicalregulatory developments and policies logistical challenges and human resource and labor risks 

our reliance on travel agencies to sell and market our cruises exposes us to certain risks which if realized could adversely impact our business 

we rely on travel agencies to generate the majority of bookings for our ships accordingly we must ensure that our commission rates and incentive structures remain competitive if we fail to offer competitive compensation packages or fail to maintain our relationships these agencies may be incentivized to sell cruises offered by our competitors to our detriment which could adversely impact our operating results our reliance on thirdparty sellers is particularly pronounced in certain markets in addition the travel agent industry is sensitive to economic 

table of c ontents 

conditions that impact discretionary income of consumers significant disruptions especially disruptions impacting those agencies that sell a high volume of our business or contractions in the industry could reduce the number of travel agencies available for us to market and sell our cruises which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

disruptions in our shoreside or shipboard operations or our information systems may adversely affect our results of operations 

our principal executive office and principal shoreside operations are located in florida and we have shoreside offices throughout the world actual or threatened natural disasters eg hurricanestyphoons earthquakes tornadoes fires or floods or similar events in these locations may have a material impact on our business continuity reputation and results of operations in addition substantial or repeated information system failures computer viruses or cyber attacks impacting our shoreside or shipboard operations could adversely impact our business we do not generally carry business interruption insurance for our shoreside or shipboard operations or our information systems as such any losses or damages incurred by us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

the loss of key personnel our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel or disruptions among our shipboard personnel due to strained employee relations could adversely affect our results of operations 

our success depends in large part on the skills and contributions of key executives and other employees and on our ability to recruit develop and retain high quality personnel as well as having adequate succession plans as demand for qualified personnel in the industry grows we must continue to effectively recruit train motivate and retain our employees both shoreside and on our ships in order to effectively compete in our industry maintain our current business and support our projected global growth 

as of december 31 2019 89 of our shipboard employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements a dispute under our collective bargaining agreements could result in a work stoppage of those employees covered by the agreements we may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate these collective bargaining agreements when they expire in addition existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage on our ships we may also be subject to or affected by work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements any such work stoppages or potential work stoppages could have a material adverse effect on our financial results as could a loss of key employees our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel or disruptions among our personnel 

business activities that involve our coinvestments with third parties may subject us to additional risks 

partnerships joint ventures and other business structures involving our coinvestments with third parties generally include some form of shared control over the operations of the business and create additional risks including the possibility that other investors in such ventures could become bankrupt or otherwise lack the financial resources to meet their obligations or could have or develop business interests policies or objectives that are inconsistent with ours in addition to financial risks our coinvestment activities may also present managerial and operational risks and expose us to reputational or legal concerns these or other issues related to our coinvestments with third parties could adversely impact our operations 

past or pending business acquisitions or potential acquisitions that we may decide to pursue in the future carry inherent risks which could adversely impact our financial performance and condition 

the company from time to time has engaged in acquisitions eg our silversea cruises acquisition and may pursue acquisitions in the future which are subject to among other factors the company’s ability to identify attractive business opportunities and to negotiate favorable terms for such opportunities accordingly the company cannot make any assurances that potential acquisitions will be completed timely or at all or that if completed we would realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisition acquisitions also carry inherent risks such as among others 1 the potential delay or failure of our efforts to successfully integrate business processes and realizing expected synergies 2 difficulty in aligning procedures controls andor policies and 3 future unknown liabilities and costs that may be associated with an acquisition in addition acquisitions may also adversely impact our liquidity andor debt levels and the recognized value of goodwill and other intangible assets can be negatively 

table of c ontents 

affected by unforeseen events andor circumstances which may result in an impairment charge any of the foregoing events could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on supply chain vendors and thirdparty service providers who are integral to the operations of our businesses these vendors and service providers may be unable or unwilling to deliver on their commitments or may act in ways that could harm our business 

we rely on supply chain vendors to deliver key products to the operations of our businesses around the world any event impacting a vendor’s ability to deliver goods of the expected quality at the location and time needed could negatively impact our ability to deliver our cruise experience events impacting our supply chain could be caused by factors beyond the control of our suppliers or us including inclement weather natural disasters increased demand problems in production or distribution andor disruptions in thirdparty logistics or transportation systems such as those caused by the recent coronavirus interruptions to our supply chain could increase costs and could limit the availability of products critical to our operations 

in order to achieve cost and operational efficiencies we outsource to thirdparty vendors certain services that are integral to the operations of our global businesses such as our onboard concessionaires certain of our call center operations and operation of a large part of our information technology systems we are subject to the risk that certain decisions are subject to the control of our thirdparty service providers and that these decisions may adversely affect our activities a failure to adequately monitor a thirdparty service provider’s compliance with a service level agreement or regulatory or legal requirements could result in significant economic and reputational harm to us there is also a risk the confidentiality privacy andor security of data held by third parties or communicated over thirdparty networks or platforms could become compromised 

if we are unable to keep pace with developments in technology or technological obsolescence our operations or competitive position could become impaired 

our business continues to demand the use of sophisticated technology and systems these technologies and systems require significant investment and must be proven refined updated upgraded andor replaced with more advanced systems in order to continue to meet our customers’ demands and expectations if we are unable to do so in a timely manner or within reasonable cost parameters or if we are unable to appropriately and timely train our employees to operate any of these new systems our business could suffer we also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new technology or system which could result in higher than anticipated costs or impair our operating results 

we are exposed to cyber security attacks and data breaches including the risks and costs associated with protecting our systems and maintaining integrity and security of our business information as well as personal data of our guests employees and business partners 

we are subject to cyber security attacks these cyber attacks can vary in scope and intent from attacks with the objective of compromising our systems networks and communications for economic gain to attacks with the objective of disrupting disabling or otherwise compromising our maritime andor shoreside operations the attacks can encompass a wide range of methods and intent including phishing attacks illegitimate requests for payment theft of intellectual property theft of confidential or nonpublic information installation of malware installation of ransomware and theft of personal or business information the breadth and scope of these attacks as well as the techniques and sophistication used to conduct these attacks have grown over time 

a successful cyber security attack may target us directly or it may be the result of a third partys inadequate care in either scenario the company may suffer damage to its systems and data that could interrupt our operations adversely impact our reputation and brand and expose us to increased risks of governmental investigation litigation fines and other liability any of which could adversely affect our business furthermore responding to such an attack and mitigating the risk of future attacks could result in additional operating and capital costs in systems technology personnel monitoring and other investments 

in addition we are also subject to various risks associated with the collection handling storage and transmission of sensitive information in the course of doing business we collect large volumes of employee customer and other thirdparty data including personally identifiable information and individual credit data for various business purposes we are subject to federal state and international laws including the european union 

table of c ontents 

general data protection regulation as well as industry standards relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of personally identifiable information and individual credit data in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between the company and its subsidiaries and among the company its subsidiaries and other parties with which the company has commercial relations several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with emerging and changing international requirements has caused and may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices if we fail to comply with the various applicable data collection and privacy laws we could be exposed to fines penalties restrictions litigation or other expenses and our business could be adversely impacted 

while we continue to evolve our cyber security practices in line with our business reliance on technology and the changing external threat landscape and we invest time effort and financial resources to secure our systems networks and communications our security measures cannot provide absolute assurance that we will be successful in preventing or responding to all cyber security attacks there can be no assurance that any breach or incident will not have a material impact on our operations and financial results 

any breach theft loss or fraudulent use of guest employee thirdparty or company data could adversely impact our reputation and brand and our ability to retain or attract new customers and expose us to risks of data loss business disruption governmental investigation litigation and other liability any of which could adversely affect our business significant capital investments and other expenditures could be required to remedy the problem and prevent future breaches including costs associated with additional security technologies personnel experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached further if we or our vendors experience significant data security breaches or fail to detect and appropriately respond to significant data security breaches we could be exposed to government enforcement actions and private litigation 

the potential unavailability of insurance coverage an inability to obtain insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates or our failure to have coverage in sufficient amounts to cover our incurred losses may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

we seek to maintain appropriate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates we normally insure based on the cost of an asset rather than replacement value and we also elect to selfinsure coinsure or use deductibles in certain circumstances for certain risks such as loss of use of a ship or a cyber security breach the limits of insurance coverage we purchase are based on the availability of the coverage evaluation of our risk profile and cost of coverage accordingly we are not protected against all risks and we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred which could result in an unexpected decrease in our revenue and results of operations in the event of an incident 

we are members of four protection and indemnity pi clubs which are part of a worldwide group of 13 pi clubs known as the international group of pi clubs the “ig” pi coverage provided by the clubs is on a mutual basis and we are subject to additional premium calls in the event of a catastrophic loss incurred by any member of the 13 pi clubs whereby the reinsurance limits purchased by the ig are exhausted we are also subject to additional premium calls based on investment and underwriting shortfalls experienced by our own individual insurers 

we cannot be certain that insurance and reinsurance coverage will be available to us and at commercially reasonable rates in the future or at all or if available that it will be sufficient to cover potential claims additionally if we or other insureds sustain significant losses the result may be higher insurance premiums cancellation of coverage or the inability to obtain coverage such events could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

environmental labor health and safety financial responsibility and other maritime regulations could affect operations and increase operating costs 

the united states and various state and foreign government or regulatory agencies have enacted or may enact environmental regulations or policies such as requiring the use of low sulfur fuels eg imo 2020 that could increase our direct cost to operate in certain markets increase our cost for fuel limit the supply of compliant fuel cause us to incur significant expenses to purchase andor develop new equipment and adversely impact the cruise 

table of c ontents 

vacation industry while we have taken and expect to continue to take a number of actions to mitigate the potential impact of certain of these regulations there can be no assurances that these efforts will be successful or completed on a timely basis 

there is increasing global regulatory focus on climate change greenhouse gas ghg and other emissions these regulatory efforts both internationally and in the united states are still developing and we cannot yet determine what the final regulatory programs or their impact will be in any jurisdiction where we do business however such climate changerelated regulatory activity in the future may adversely affect our business and financial results by requiring us to reduce our emissions purchase allowances or otherwise pay for our emissions such activity may also impact us by increasing our operating costs including fuel costs 

in addition we are subject to various international national state and local laws regulations and treaties that govern among other things discharge from our ships safety standards applicable to our ships treatment of disabled persons health and sanitary standards applicable to our guests security standards on board our ships and at the shipport interface areas and financial responsibilities to our guests these issues are and we believe will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world this could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise ships that could subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 

a change in our tax status under the united states internal revenue code or other jurisdictions may have adverse effects on our income  

we and a number of our subsidiaries are foreign corporations that derive income from a us trade or business andor from sources within the united states in connection with the year end audit each year drinker biddle  reath llp our us tax counsel delivers to us an opinion based on certain representations and assumptions set forth in it to the effect that this income to the extent derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships is excluded from gross income for us federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 883 of the internal revenue code we believe that most of our income including that of our subsidiaries is derived from or incidental to the international operation of ships 

our ability to rely on section 883 could be challenged or could change in the future provisions of the internal revenue code including section 883 are subject to legislative change at any time moreover changes could occur in the future with respect to the identity residence or holdings of our direct or indirect shareholders trading volume or trading frequency of our shares or relevant foreign tax laws of liberia or bahamas such that they no longer qualify as equivalent exemption jurisdictions that could affect our eligibility for the section 883 exemption accordingly there can be no assurance that we will continue to be exempt from us income tax on us source shipping income in the future if we were not entitled to the benefit of section 883 we and our subsidiaries would be subject to us taxation on a portion of the income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships which would reduce our net income 

additionally portions of our business are operated by companies that are within the united kingdom tonnage tax regime further some of our operations are conducted in jurisdictions where we rely on tax treaties to provide exemption from taxation to the extent the united kingdom tonnage tax laws change or we do not continue to meet the applicable qualification requirements or if tax treaties are changed or revoked we may be required to pay higher income tax in these jurisdictions adversely impacting our results of operations 

as budgetary constraints continue to adversely impact the jurisdictions in which we operate increases in income tax regulations tax audits or tax reform affecting our operations may be imposed 

litigation enforcement actions fines or penalties could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations andor damage our reputation 

our business is subject to various united states and international laws and regulations that could lead to enforcement actions fines civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims and damages in addition improper conduct by our employees agents or joint venture partners could damage our reputation andor lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties including substantial monetary fines in certain circumstances it may not be economical to defend against such matters andor our legal strategy may not ultimately result in us prevailing in a matter such events could lead to an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

table of c ontents 

we are not a united states corporation and our shareholders may be subject to the uncertainties of a foreign legal system in protecting their interests 

our corporate affairs are governed by our articles of incorporation and bylaws and by the business corporation act of liberia the provisions of the business corporation act of liberia resemble provisions of the corporation laws of a number of states in the united states however while most states have a fairly well developed body of case law interpreting their respective corporate statutes there are very few judicial cases in liberia interpreting the business corporation act of liberia as such the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under liberian law are not as clearly established as the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under statutes or judicial precedent in certain united states jurisdictions for example the right of shareholders to bring a derivative action in liberian courts may be more limited than in united states jurisdictions there may also be practical difficulties for shareholders attempting to bring suit in liberia and liberian courts may or may not recognize and enforce foreign judgments thus our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests with respect to actions by management directors or controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a united states jurisdiction 

provisions of our articles of incorporation bylaws and liberian law could inhibit others from acquiring us prevent a change of control and may prevent efforts by our shareholders to change our management 

certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and liberian law may inhibit third parties from effectuating a change of control of the company without approval from our board of directors which could result in the entrenchment of current management these include provisions in our articles of incorporation that prevent third parties other than a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates from acquiring beneficial ownership of more than 49 of our outstanding shares without the consent of our board of directors

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap refer to note 1 general and note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  certain of our accounting policies are deemed critical as they require managements highest degree of judgment estimates and assumptions we have discussed these accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors we believe our most critical accounting policies are as follows 

ship accounting 

ships represent our most significant assets and are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization depreciation of ships is generally computed net of a 1015 projected residual value using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of the asset which is generally 3035 years the 3035 year useful life and 1015 residual value is the weightedaverage of all major components of a ship our useful life and residual value estimates take into consideration the impact of anticipated technological changes longterm cruise and vacation market conditions and historical useful lives of similarlybuilt ships in addition we take into consideration our estimates of the weightedaverage useful lives of the ships major component systems such as hull superstructure main electric engines and cabins we employ a cost allocation methodology at the component level in order to support the estimated weightedaverage useful lives and residual values as well as to determine the net cost basis of assets being replaced given the very large and complex nature of our ships our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain we do not have cost segregation studies performed to specifically componentize our ship systems however we estimate the costs useful lives and residual values of component systems based principally on general and technical information known about major ship component systems and their lives as well as our knowledge of the cruise vacation industry we do not identify and track depreciation by ship component systems but instead utilize these estimates to determine the net cost basis of assets replaced or refurbished improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized as additions to the ship and depreciated over the shorter of the improvements estimated useful lives or that of the associated ship the estimated cost and accumulated depreciation of replaced or refurbished ship components are written off and any resulting losses are recognized within cruise operating expenses in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss 

we periodically review estimated useful lives and residual values for ongoing reasonableness considering long term views on our intended use of each class of ships and the planned level of improvements to maintain and enhance vessels within those classes in the event a factor is identified that may trigger a change in the estimated useful lives and residual values of our ships a review of the estimate is completed in the fourth quarter of 2019 we completed a modernization of the oasis of the seas under our ship upgrade program the level of capital investment as well as planned investment levels in the other ships within the oasis class triggered a review of the estimated useful lives and residual values of the oasisclass ships following a review of the estimate considering the intended use of the vessel and assessment of the estimated lives of component assets forming the oasis class ships we concluded a change to the estimated lives and residual values of oasis class ships was required effective fourth quarter of 2019 we revised the estimated useful lives and residual values of the oasisclass ships from 30 years with a 15 residual value to 35 years with a 10 residual value the change in the estimated useful lives and residual values was accounted for prospectively as a change in accounting estimate for further information regarding this change in accounting estimate refer to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

we use the deferral method to account for drydocking costs under the deferral method drydocking costs incurred are deferred and charged to expense on a straightline basis over the period to the next scheduled drydock which we estimate to be a period of thirty to sixty months based on the vessels age as required by class deferred drydock costs consist of the costs to drydock the vessel and other costs incurred in connection with the drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessels class certification class certification is necessary in order for our cruise ships to be flagged in a specific country obtain liability insurance and legally operate as passenger cruise ships the activities associated with those drydocking costs cannot be performed while the vessel is in service and as such are done during a drydock as a planned major maintenance activity the significant deferred drydock costs consist of hauling and wharfage services provided by the drydock facility hull inspection and related activities eg scraping pressure cleaning bottom painting maintenance to steering propulsion thruster equipment and ballast 

table of c ontents 

tanks port services such as tugs pilotage and line handling and freight associated with these items we perform a detailed analysis of the various activities performed for each drydock and only defer those costs that are directly related to planned major maintenance activities necessary to maintain class the costs deferred are related to activities not otherwise routinely periodically performed to maintain a vessels designed and intended operating capability repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred 

we use judgment when estimating the period between drydocks which can result in adjustments to the estimated amortization of drydock costs if the vessel is disposed of before the next drydock the remaining balance in deferred drydock is writtenoff to the gain or loss upon disposal of vessel in the period in which the sale takes place we also use judgment when identifying costs incurred during a drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessels class certification as compared to those costs attributable to repairs and maintenance which are expensed as incurred 

we believe we have made reasonable estimates for ship accounting purposes however should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimates of ship useful lives or projected residual values depreciation expense could be materially higher or lower if circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making determinations as to whether ship improvements should be capitalized the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance costs could increase partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense if we had reduced our estimated average ship useful life by one year depreciation expense for 2019 would have increased by approximately 1293 million if our ships were estimated to have no residual value depreciation expense for 2019 would have increased by approximately 3251 million 

business combinations 

on july 31 2018 we acquired a 667 equity stake in silversea cruises for 102 billion in cash and contingent consideration refer to note 3 business combination to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further information on the acquisition 

we account for business combinations in accordance with asc 805 business combinations  by applying the acquisition method of accounting the acquisition method of accounting requires that we record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the noncontrolling interest if any at their respective fair values at the acquisition date goodwill is recognized as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired significant estimates and assumptions are made by management to value such assets and liabilities based on third party valuations such as appraisals or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques although we believe that those estimates and assumptions are reasonable and appropriate they are inherently uncertain and subject to change if during the measurement period not to exceed one year additional information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date related to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed we may adjust our estimates to account for subsequent adjustments to the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date resulting in an offsetting adjustment to the goodwill associated with the business acquired 

uncertain tax positions and taxrelated valuation allowances are initially established in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date we continue to collect information and reevaluate these estimates and assumptions quarterly we will record any adjustments to our preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that we are within the oneyear measurement period our purchase price measurement period for the silversea cruises acquisition was closed during 2019 

any contingent consideration is estimated at fair value at the acquisition date liabilityclassified contingent consideration is remeasured each reporting period with changes in fair value recognized in earnings until the contingent consideration is settled 

valuation of goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets and longlived assets 

we review goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or when events or circumstances dictate more frequently the impairment review for goodwill consists of a qualitative assessment of whether it is morelikelythannot that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount and if necessary a twostep goodwill impairment test factors to consider when performing the qualitative assessment include general economic conditions limitations on accessing capital changes in forecasted operating results changes in fuel prices and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates if the qualitative assessment demonstrates 

table of c ontents 

that it is morelikelythannot that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value it is not necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to step one for any reporting unit in any period on a periodic basis we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed to step one to corroborate the results of recent years qualitative assessments we can resume the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any subsequent period 

when performing the twostep goodwill impairment test the fair value of the reporting unit is determined and compared to the carrying value of the net assets allocated to the reporting unit we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a probabilityweighted discounted cash flow model the estimation of fair value utilizing discounted expected future cash flows includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of expected revenues operating costs marketing selling and administrative expenses interest rates ship additions and retirements as well as assumptions regarding the cruise vacation industrys competitive environment and general economic and business conditions among other factors the principal assumptions we use in the discounted cash flow model are projected operating results weightedaverage cost of capital and terminal value the discounted cash flow model uses the most current projected operating results for the upcoming fiscal year as a base to that base we add future years cash flows assuming multiple revenue and expense scenarios that reflect the impact of different global economic environments beyond the base year on the reporting unit we discount the projected cash flows using rates specific to the reporting unit based on its weightedaverage cost of capital if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value no further analysis or writedown of goodwill is required if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of its net assets the implied fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all its underlying assets and liabilities including both recognized and unrecognized tangible and intangible assets based on their fair value if necessary goodwill is then written down to its implied fair value 

the impairment review for indefinitelife intangible assets can be performed using a qualitative or quantitative impairment assessment the quantitative assessment consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount we estimate the fair value of these assets using a discounted cash flow model and various valuation methods depending on the nature of the intangible asset such as the relieffromroyalty method for trademarks and trade names if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess if the fair value exceeds its carrying amount the indefinitelife intangible asset is not considered impaired other intangible assets assigned finite useful lives are amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives refer to note 6 intangible assets to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplemental data for further information on indefinitelife intangible assets 

we review our ships and other longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable we evaluate asset impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities the lowest level for which we maintain identifiable cash flows that are independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities is at the ship level for our ships and prior to the sale of the aircraft at the aggregated asset group level for our aircraft if estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of an asset an impairment charge is recognized to the extent its carrying value exceeds fair value 

we estimate fair value based on quoted market prices in active markets if available if active markets are not available we base fair value on independent appraisals sales price negotiations and projected future cash flows discounted at a rate estimated by management to be commensurate with the business risk quoted market prices are often not available for individual reporting units and for indefinitelife intangible assets accordingly we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit and an indefinitelife intangible asset using an expected present value technique 

royal caribbean international 

during the fourth quarter of 2019 we performed a qualitative assessment of the royal caribbean international reporting unit based on our qualitative assessment we concluded that it was morelikelythannot that the estimated fair value of the royal caribbean international reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and thus we did not proceed to the twostep goodwill impairment test no indicators of impairment exist primarily because the reporting units fair value has consistently exceeded its carrying value by a significant margin and forecasts of operating results expected to be generated by the reporting unit appear sufficient to support its carrying value as of 

table of c ontents 

december 31 2019 the carrying amount of goodwill attributable to our royal caribbean reporting unit was 2992 million 

silversea cruises 

the goodwill for the silversea cruises reporting unit was recorded at fair value at july 31 2018 the acquisition date refer to note 3 business combination to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplemental data for further information on the silversea cruises acquisition during the fourth quarter of 2019 we performed a qualitative assessment of the silversea cruises reporting unit based on our qualitative assessment we concluded that it was morelikelythannot that the estimated fair value of the silversea cruises reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and thus we did not proceed to the twostep goodwill impairment test no indicators of impairment exist primarily because forecasts of operating results expected to be generated by the reporting unit appear sufficient to support its carrying value as of december 31 2019 the carrying amount of goodwill attributable to our silversea cruises reporting unit was 11 billion 

the indefinitelife intangible asset related to the silversea cruises trade name acquired in the silversea cruises acquisition was recorded at fair value at july 31 2018 the acquisition date during the fourth quarter of 2019 we performed a qualitative assessment of the silversea cruises trade name as a result of the assessment performed no impairment charge was recorded related to trade name intangible assets for the year ended december 31 2019 as of december 31 2019 and 2018 the carrying amount of indefinitelife intangible assets was 3523 million and 3517 million respectively which primarily relates to the silversea cruises trade name acquired in the silversea cruises acquisition 

derivative instruments 

we enter into various forward swap and option contracts to manage our interest rate exposure and to limit our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices these instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value and the vast majority are designated as hedges we also use nonderivative financial instruments designated as hedges of our net investment in our foreign operations and investments although certain of our derivative financial instruments do not qualify or are not accounted for under hedge accounting we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes we account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with authoritative guidance refer to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies and note 18 fair value measurements and derivative instruments to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for more information on related authoritative guidance the companys hedging programs and derivative financial instruments 

on a regular basis we enter into foreign currency forward contracts interest rate and fuel swaps and options with thirdparty institutions in overthecounter markets we estimate the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps using expected future cash flows based on the instruments contract terms and published forward prices for foreign currency exchange and interest rates we value floors which are embedded within our interest rate swaps using standard option pricing models with inputs based on the options’ contract terms such as exercise price and maturity and readily available market data such as forward interest rates and interest rate volatility we apply present value techniques and libor or euriborbased discount rates to convert the expected future cash flows to the current fair value of the instruments 

we estimate the fair value of our fuel swaps using expected future cash flows based on the swaps contract terms and forward prices we derive forward prices from published forward fuel curves which in turn are based on actual market transactions and published price quotes for similar assets we apply present value techniques and liborbased discount rates to convert the expected future cash flows to the current fair value of the instruments we also corroborate our fair value estimates using valuations provided by our counterparties 

we adjust the valuation of our derivative financial instruments to incorporate credit risk 

we believe it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate and fuel swaps and options would be derived from other appropriate valuation models using similar assumptions inputs or conditions suggested by actual historical experience

contingencies—litigation 

on an ongoing basis we assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss if any can be made in assessing probable losses we take into consideration estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries if any which are recorded as assets when recoverability is probable we accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recoveries it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made 

seasonality 

our revenues are seasonal based on demand for cruises demand is strongest for cruises during the northern hemispheres summer months and holidays in order to mitigate the impact of the winter weather in the northern hemisphere and to capitalize on the summer season in the southern hemisphere our brands have focused on deployment to the caribbean asia and australia during that period 

financial presentation 

description of certain line items 

revenues 

our revenues are comprised of the following 

• passenger ticket revenues  which consist of revenue recognized from the sale of passenger tickets and the sale of air transportation to and from our ships and 

• onboard and other revenues  which consist primarily of revenues from the sale of goods andor services onboard our ships not included in passenger ticket prices cancellation fees sales of vacation protection insurance pre and postcruise tours and fees for operating certain port facilities onboard and other revenues also include revenues we receive from independent third party concessionaires that pay us a percentage of their revenues in exchange for the right to provide selected goods andor services onboard our ships as well as revenues received for our bareboat charter procurement and management related services we perform on behalf of our unconsolidated affiliates 

cruise operating expenses 

our cruise operating expenses are comprised of the following 

• commissions transportation and other expenses  which consist of those costs directly associated with passenger ticket revenues including travel agent commissions air and other transportation expenses port costs that vary with passenger head counts and related credit card fees 

• onboard and other expenses  which consist of the direct costs associated with onboard and other revenues including the costs of products sold onboard our ships vacation protection insurance premiums costs associated with pre and postcruise tours and related credit card fees as well as the minimal costs associated with concession revenues as the costs are mostly incurred by thirdparty concessionaires and costs incurred for the procurement and management related services we perform on behalf of our unconsolidated affiliates 

• payroll and related expenses  which consist of costs for shipboard personnel costs associated with our shoreside personnel are included in marketing selling and administrative expenses  

• food expenses  which include food costs for both guests and crew 

• fuel expenses  which include fuel and related delivery storage and emission consumable costs and the financial impact of fuel swap agreements and 

table of c ontents 

• other operating expenses  which consist primarily of operating costs such as repairs and maintenance port costs that do not vary with passenger head counts vessel related insurance entertainment and gains andor losses related to the sale of our ships if any 

we do not allocate payroll and related expenses food expenses fuel expenses or other operating expenses to the expense categories attributable to passenger ticket revenues or onboard and other revenues since they are incurred to provide the total cruise vacation experience 

selected operational and financial metrics 

we utilize a variety of operational and financial metrics which are defined below to evaluate our performance and financial condition as discussed in more detail herein certain of these metrics are nongaap financial measures these nongaap financial measures are provided along with the related gaap financial measures as we believe they provide useful information to investors as a supplement to our consolidated financial statements which are prepared and presented in accordance with gaap the presentation of nongaap financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap 

program refers to the multiyear program designed to communicate and motivate employees to work towards company specific goals the program includes five goals by 2025 delivering 2000 adjusted earnings per share further reducing the company’s carbon footprint by 25 against a 2019 base delivering strong returns on invested capital and continuing to improve on record guest satisfaction and employee engagement metrics these goals have been put in place to focus our leadership on achieving outsized improvements in our performance going forward and are purposely aspirational the strategies that we will employ to achieve the goals of the program are consistent with our ongoing operating strategies as listed in the operating strategies section during the sixyear time horizon of this program there are many factors that will impact our ability to achieve these ambitious goals in particular our goal of reducing our carbon footprint by 25 will be challenging and will depend on our ability to take aggressive steps including the use of new technologies that have not yet been developed or proven 

adjusted earnings per share adjusted eps represents adjusted net income attributable to royal caribbean cruises ltd divided by weighted average shares outstanding or by diluted weighted average shares outstanding as applicable we believe that this nongaap measure is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis 

adjusted net income represents net income less net income attributable to noncontrolling interest excluding certain items that we believe adjusting for is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis for the periods presented these items included i costs net of insurance recoveries related to the grand bahama drydock structure incident involving oasis of the seas  ii our equity share of the writeoff of the grand bahama drydock and other incidental expenses by grand bahama iii the noncontrolling interest adjustment to exclude the impact of the contractual accretion requirements associated with the put option held by heritage cruise holding ltds previously known as silversea cruises group ltd noncontrolling interest iv the change in fair value in the contingent consideration related to the silversea cruises acquisition v a loss on the early extinguishment of debt related to the repayment of certain loans vi the amortization of the silversea cruises intangible assets resulting from the acquisition vii integration costs related to the silversea cruises acquisition viii transaction costs related to the silversea cruises acquisition ix restructuring charges incurred in relation to the reorganization of our international sales and marketing structure and other initiatives x the impairment loss and other costs related to the exit of our tour operations business xi the impairment loss related to skysea holding and xii the impact of the change in accounting principle related to the recognition of stockbased compensation expense from the graded attribution method to the straightline attribution method for timebased stock awards 

available passenger cruise days  apcd  is our measurement of capacity and represents double occupancy per cabin multiplied by the number of cruise days for the period which excludes canceled cruise days and drydock days we use this measure to perform capacity and rate analysis to identify our main noncapacity drivers that cause our cruise revenue and expenses to vary 

gross cruise costs represent the sum of total cruise operating expenses plus marketing selling and administrative expenses for the periods presented gross cruise costs exclude i restructuring charges incurred 

table of c ontents 

in relation to the reorganization of our international sales and marketing structure and other initiatives ii transaction costs related to the silversea cruises acquisition iii integration costs related to the silversea cruises acquisition iv the impairment loss and other costs related to the exit of our tour operations business and v the impact of the change in accounting principle related to the recognition of stockbased compensation expense from the graded attribution method to the straightline attribution method for timebased stock awards which were included within marketing selling and administrative expenses  

gross yields represent total revenues per apcd 

net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel represent gross cruise costs excluding commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses and in the case of net cruise costs excluding fuel fuel expenses each of which is described above under the description of certain line items heading in measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income we believe changes in net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance a reconciliation of historical gross cruise costs to net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel is provided below under results of operations net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel exclude the costs net of insurance recoveries related to the grand bahama drydock structure incident involving oasis of the seas  

net revenues represent total revenues less commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses each of which is described above under the description of certain line items heading 

net yields represent net revenues per apcd we utilize net revenues and net yields to manage our business on a daytoday basis as we believe that they are the most relevant measures of our pricing performance because they reflect the cruise revenues earned by us net of our most significant variable costs which are commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses a reconciliation of historical gross yields to net yields is provided below under results of operations  

occupancy  in accordance with cruise vacation industry practice is calculated by dividing passenger cruise days by apcd a percentage in excess of 100 indicates that three or more passengers occupied some cabins 

passenger cruise days represent the number of passengers carried for the period multiplied by the number of days of their respective cruises 

we believe net yields net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel are our most relevant nongaap financial measures however a significant portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar because our reporting currency is the united states dollar the value of these revenues and expenses can be affected by changes in currency exchange rates although such changes in local currency prices are just one of many elements impacting our revenues and expenses they can be an important element for this reason we also monitor net yields net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel as if the current periods currency exchange rates had remained constant with the comparable prior periods rates or on a constant currency basis 

it should be emphasized that constant currency is primarily used for comparing shortterm changes andor projections changes in guest sourcing and shifting the amount of purchases between currencies can change the impact of the purely currencybased fluctuations 

the use of certain significant nongaap measures such as net yields net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel allows us to perform capacity and rate analysis to separate the impact of known capacity changes from other less predictable changes which affect our business we believe these nongaap measures provide expanded insight to measure revenue and cost performance in addition to the standard gaap based financial measures there are no specific rules or regulations for determining nongaap and constant currency measures and as such they may not be comparable to other companies within the industry 

we have not provided a quantitative reconciliation of i projected total revenues to projected net revenues ii projected gross yields to projected net yields iii projected gross cruise costs to projected net cruise costs and projected net cruise costs excluding fuel and iv projected net income attributable to royal caribbean cruises ltd and earnings per share to projected adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share because preparation of meaningful gaap projections of total revenues gross yields gross cruise costs net income attributable to royal caribbean cruises ltd and earnings per share would require unreasonable effort due to 

table of c ontents 

significant uncertainty we are unable to predict without unreasonable effort the future movement of foreign exchange rates fuel prices and interest rates inclusive of our related hedging programs in addition we are unable to determine the future impact of restructuring expenses or other noncore business related gains and losses which may result from strategic initiatives these items are uncertain and could be material to our results of operations in accordance with gaap due to this uncertainty we do not believe that reconciling information for such projected figures would be meaningful

executive overview 

by all accounts 2019 was another year of very strong performance we introduced three new vessels  spectrum of the seas celebrity flora and tui cruise s mein schiff 2  launched a very successful perfect day destination at coco cay modernized six ships and implemented excalibur our digital transformation platform on most of the fleet in addition we continued to find efficiencies implement synergies and reduce costs while at the same time remained focused on strategic investments in areas that will boost revenue 

our 2019 net income was 19 billion or 895 per diluted share compared to 18 billion or 856 per diluted share in 2018 adjusted net income for 2019 was 20 billion or 954 per diluted share compared to 19 billion or 886 per diluted share in 2018 adjusted eps for 2019 on a diluted basis represents an 8 increase in earnings compared to 2018 we were able to achieve these results despite the drydock incident in the grand bahama shipyard the cancellation of cruises to cuba beginning in june of this year and an unusual hurricane season all of which negatively impacted the company’s adjusted earnings per share for the year by approximately 080 

total revenues increased 15 billion in 2019 to 110 billion compared to 95 billion in 2018 primarily driven by increases in both ticket and onboard yields during 2019 our gross yields and net yields increased by 80 on a constantcurrency basis marking the tenth consecutive year of revenue growth the addition of new vessels to the fleet the consolidation of silversea cruises perfect day at cococay and our miami terminal operation also contributed to our yearoveryear revenue growth onboard revenue and net onboard revenue growth came from a variety of revenue enhancing initiatives including beverage package sales and promotions gaming initiatives and new strategies and promotions on our shore excursions specialty restaurants and internet services 

cruise operating expenses increased 8010 million in 2019 to 61 billion from 53 billion in 2018 adjusting for capacity our gross cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel increased by 87 and 114 respectively on a constant currency basis compared to 2018 driven primarily by the consolidation of silversea cruises our new operations of perfect day at cococay and our terminal operation in miami 

the company remains focused on improving returns for our shareholders in 2019 we bought back 1000 million in shares of common stock and have 6000 million remaining under our 10 billion share repurchase program that was announced in may 2018 consistent with our earnings growth we also announced a 11 increase to our common stock dividend our seventh consecutive year with a dividend increase 

perfect day at cococay is the first of our perfect day island collection of nextlevel private destinations the island debuted a combination of firstoftheirkind thrills and oneofakind ways to chill that significantly change what is possible in a vacation destination the island features the tallest waterslide in north america the up and away helium balloon and the caribbean’s largest wave pool 

the year 2020 has started off challenging as we address the impact of the recent coronavirus outbreak on our operations prior to the outbreak our sailings in china were trending particularly well both in terms of rate and volume our itineraries in china were expected to represent 6 and 4 of our full year and first quarter 2020 capacity respectively the travel restrictions and other measures taken by china and other countries to contain the disease have resulted in the cancellation of an increasing number of our cruises in the region we have also implemented several measures restricting the boarding of certain atrisk guests and crew on our ships these and other concerns and restrictions relating to the coronavirus outbreak are having an impact on the demand for cruises and causing travel restrictions guest cancellations an unavailability of ports andor destinations ship redeployments and an inability to source our crew provisions or supplies from certain places all of these issues are having and are likely to continue to have a material impact on our bookings operations and our overall financial performance however given the fluidity and uncertainty of this situation we are unable to predict the full financial impact that this incident will have on our operations and financial condition including what our yields and earnings for 2020 will be see outlook  

in 2020 we expect our capacity to increase 48 yearoveryear as we add odyssey of the seas and celebrity apex as well as two silversea vessels silver origin and silver moon  to the fleet we’ve slightly 

table of c ontents 

increased our capacity in the caribbean to over 50 of our total capacity in 2020 driven by the inaugural winter seasons of odyssey of the seas and celebrity apex  our european itineraries will account for 17 of our 2020 capacity with the yearoveryear increase driven by the timing of drydocks and the addition of celebrity apex and silver moon  excluding the impact of the recent coronavirus outbreak we expect another year of total revenue and net yield growth driven by our new ships strong demand for our core products and continued growth from our onboard revenue areas 

in addition we recently announced our program which presents specific goals to be achieved by 2025 delivering 2000 adjusted earnings per share further reducing the company’s carbon footprint by 25 delivering strong returns on invested capital and continuing to improve on record guest satisfaction and employee engagement metrics our management team is goal motivated and our aim through this program is to establish clear simple and ambitious targets that will motivate our people and drive superior results adopting these clear and simple goals will help guide our everyday decisionmaking to focus on people profits and planet

results of operations 

for reporting purposes we include silversea cruises’ results of operations on a threemonth reporting lag from october 1 2018 through september 30 2019 in our consolidated results of operations for the year ended december 31 2019 and from the date of acquisition through september 30 2018 in our consolidated results of operations for the year ended december 31 2018 refer to note 1 general and note 3 business combinations to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further information on the threemonth reporting lag and the silversea cruises acquisition 

in addition to the items discussed above under executive overview significant items for 2019 include

• total revenues excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency rates increased by 16 billion for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to an increase in capacity and an increase in ticket prices and onboard spending on a per passenger basis which are further discussed below 

• the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our passenger ticket and onboard and other revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar resulted in a decrease in total revenues of 1274 million for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 

• total cruise operating expenses excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency rate increased by 8375 million for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to an increase in capacity which is further discussed below 

• the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our cruise operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar resulted in a decrease in total operating expenses of 369 million for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 

• effective june 5th 2019 we stopped sailings to cuba as the us government rescinded authorized travel to cuba under the peopletopeople program and prohibited travel to cuba via cruise ships the estimated negative impact resulting from this regulatory change primarily due to changes in itineraries is approximately 029 per share on a diluted basis to our net income attributable to royal caribbean cruises ltd 

• the estimated negative impact resulting from the grand bahama drydock structure incident involving oasis of the seas  net of insurance recoveries and including our share of the writeoff of the related drydock by grand bahama is approximately 036 per share on a diluted basis to our net income attributable to royal caribbean cruises ltd 

• the estimated negative impact resulting from 2019 hurricanerelated disruptions was approximately 015 per share on a diluted basis to our net income attributable to royal caribbean cruises ltd 

• in april 2019 we entered into and drew in full on an unsecured threeyear term loan agreement in the amount of 10 billion proceeds of this loan were used to repay the 700 million 364day loan due july 2019 related to the acquisition of silversea cruises and the remaining balance of the unsecured term loan originally incurred in 2010 to purchase allure of the seas  the repayment of these loans resulted in a total loss on the extinguishment of debt of 63 million which was recognized within other expense income within our consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss

outlook 

the widely reported coronavirus outbreak and efforts by china and other countries to move aggressively to contain the spread of the disease have adversely impacted our business including a drop in demand for cruises guest cancellations travel restrictions an unavailability of ports andor destinations cruise cancellations ship redeployments and an inability to source our crew provisions or supplies from certain places we have implemented several measures to protect guest and crew including denying boarding to those that have travelled from to or through mainland china or hong kong in the past 15 days and performing mandatory specialized health screenings on atrisk guest and crew these measures have caused us to cancel cruise bookings or restrict certain guests from booking our cruises we are assessing the developments constantly and will update our protective measures as needed 

as a result of these measures we have now cancelled 30 sailings in southeast asia and modified several itineraries in the region which overall have an estimated impact of 090 per share to our 2020 financial performance if the company were to cancel all of its remaining sailings in asia through the end of april it would impact our 2020 financial performance by an additional 030 

there are still too many variables and uncertainties regarding the impact of this outbreak on our business in asia and elsewhere to reasonably forecast the full impact on our business including what our yields and earnings for 2020 will be these concerns and restrictions over the outbreak are impacting our bookings and are having and are likely to continue to have a material impact on our overall financial performance 

the company does not make predictions about fuel pricing interest rates or currency exchange rates but does provide guidance about its future business activities on february 4 2020 we announced the following initial full year and first quarter 2020 guidance based on the then current fuel pricing interest rates and currency exchange rates given the fluidity of the circumstances related to the recent coronavirus and the actions being taken to contain its spread the following 2020 guidance does not include any financial impact related to the coronavirus outbreak

first quarter 2020 



since our earnings release on february 4 2020 fuel prices and foreign currency exchange rates have fluctuated and are likely to continue to do so accordingly except for the impact of the recent coronavirus outbreak described above fuel prices and foreign currency exchange rates our forecast remains essentially unchanged

we and tui ag have each guaranteed the repayment by tui cruises of 50 of a bank loan as of december 31 2019 the outstanding principal amount of the loan was € 264 million or approximately  297 million based on the exchange rate at december 31 2019 the loan amortizes quarterly and is currently secured by a first mortgage on mein schiff herz previously known as mein schiff 2  based on current facts and circumstances we do not believe potential obligations under our guarantee of this bank loan are probable 

tui cruises has entered into various ship construction and credit agreements that include certain restrictions on each of our and tui ags ability to reduce our current ownership interest in tui cruises below 3755  through may 2031 

some of the contracts that we enter into include indemnification provisions that obligate us to make payments to the counterparty if certain events occur these contingencies generally relate to changes in taxes increased lender capital costs and other similar costs the indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms and are entered into in the normal course of business there are no stated or notional amounts included in the indemnification clauses and we are not able to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments if any under these indemnification clauses we have not been required to make any payments under such indemnification clauses in the past and under current circumstances we do not believe an indemnification obligation is probable 

as of december 31 2019 other than the items described above we are not party to any other offbalance sheet arrangements including guarantee contracts retained or contingent interest certain derivative instruments and variable interest entities that either have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial position 

funding needs and sources 

we have significant contractual obligations of which our debt service obligations and the capital expenditures associated with our ship purchases represent our largest funding needs as of december 31 2019 we had approximately 55 billion in contractual obligations due through december 31 2020 of which approximately 26 billion relates to debt maturities including our commercial paper notes 3488 million relates to interest on debt and 22 billion relates to progress payments on our ship orders and the final installments payable due upon the deliveries of celebrity apex silver origin silver moon and odyssey of the seas in 2020  we have historically relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations drawdowns under our available credit facilities and our commercial paper program the incurrence of additional debt andor the refinancing of our existing debt and the issuance of additional shares of equity securities to fund these obligations 

as of december 31 2019 we had a working capital deficit of 68 billion which included 12 billion of current portion of debt including finance leases and 14 billion of commercial paper as of december 31 2018 we had a working capital deficit of 59 billion which included 16 billion of current portion of debt including finance leases and 08 million of commercial paper similar to others in our industry we operate with a substantial working capital deficit this deficit is mainly attributable to the fact that under our business model a vast majority of our passenger ticket receipts are collected in advance of the applicable sailing date these advance passenger 

table of c ontents 

receipts remain a current liability until the sailing date the cash generated from these advance receipts is used interchangeably with cash on hand from other sources such as our revolving credit facilities commercial paper and other cash from operations the cash received as advanced receipts can be used to fund operating expenses for the applicable future sailing or otherwise pay down our revolving credit facilities and commercial paper invest in long term investments or any other use of cash in addition we have a relatively lowlevel of accounts receivable and rapid turnover results in a limited investment in inventories we generate substantial cash flows from operations and our business model along with our unsecured revolving credit facilities has historically allowed us to maintain this working capital deficit and still meet our operating investing and financing needs we expect that we will continue to have working capital deficits in the future 

as of december 31 2019 we had liquidity of 15 billion consisting of 2437 million in cash and cash equivalents and 13 billion available under our unsecured credit facilities net of our outstanding commercial paper notes 

we anticipate that our cash flows from operations and our current financing arrangements as described above will be adequate to meet our capital expenditures and debt repayments over the next twelvemonth period 

as of december 31 2019 we have approximately 6000 million that remains available for future common stock repurchase transactions under a 24month common stock repurchase program for up to 10 billion authorized by our board of directors in may 2018 repurchases under the program may be made at managements discretion from time to time on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and are expected to be funded from available cash or borrowings refer to note 12 shareholders equity to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplemental data for further information 

if any person acquires ownership of more than 50 of our common stock or subject to certain exceptions during any 24month period a majority of our board of directors is no longer comprised of individuals who were members of our board of directors on the first day of such period we may be obligated to prepay indebtedness outstanding under our credit facilities which we may be unable to replace on similar terms our public debt securities also contain change of control provisions that would be triggered by a thirdparty acquisition of greater than 50 of our common stock coupled with a ratings downgrade if this were to occur it would have an adverse impact on our liquidity and operations 

debt covenants 

certain of our financing agreements contain covenants that require us among other things to maintain minimum net worth of at least 99 billion a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 125x and limit our net debttocapital ratio to no more than 625 the fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated by dividing net cash from operations for the past four quarters by the sum of dividend payments plus scheduled principal debt payments in excess of any new financings for the past four quarters our minimum net worth and maximum net debttocapital calculations exclude the impact of accumulated other comprehensive loss on total shareholders equity  we were well in excess of all debt covenant requirements as of december 31 2019 the specific covenants and related definitions can be found in the applicable debt agreements the majority of which have been previously filed with the securities and exchange commission 

dividends 

in december 2019 we declared a cash dividend on our common stock of 078 per share which was paid in the first quarter of 2020 we declared a cash dividend on our common stock of 078 per share during the third quarter of 2019 which was paid in the fourth quarter of 2019 during the first and second quarters of 2019 we declared a cash dividend on our common stock of 070 per share which was paid in the second and third quarters of 2019 respectively during the first quarter of 2019 we also paid a cash dividend on our common stock of 070 per share which was declared during the fourth quarter of 2018

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial instruments and other 

general 

we are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices we try to mitigate these risks through a combination of our normal operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments pursuant to our hedging practices and policies the financial impact of these hedging instruments is primarily offset by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures being hedged we achieve this by closely matching the amount term and conditions of the derivative instrument with the underlying risk being hedged although certain of our derivative financial instruments do not qualify or are not accounted for under hedge accounting our objective is not to hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes refer to note 18 fair value measurements and derivative instruments to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our longterm debt obligations including future interest payments at december 31 2019 approximately 621 of our longterm debt was effectively fixed as compared to 591 as of december 31 2018 we use interest rate swap agreements to modify our exposure to interest rate movements and to manage our interest expense 

market risk associated with our longterm fixed rate debt is the potential increase in fair value resulting from a decrease in interest rates we use interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a portion of our fixedrate debt to a floatingrate basis to manage this risk at december 31 2019 and 2018 we maintained interest rate swap agreements on the following fixedrate debt instruments 



these interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as fair value hedges 

the estimated fair value of our longterm fixedrate debt at december 31 2019 was 56 billion using quoted market prices where available or using the present value of expected future cash flows which incorporates risk profile the fair value of our fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements was estimated to be a liability of 16 million as of december 31 2019 based on the present value of expected future cash flows a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates at december 31 2019 would increase the fair value of our hedged and unhedged longterm fixedrate debt by approximately 2662 million and would increase the fair value of our fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements by approximately 165 million 

market risk associated with our longterm floatingrate debt is the potential increase in interest expense from an increase in interest rates we use interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a portion of our floatingrate debt to a fixedrate basis to manage this risk a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase our forecasted 2020 interest expense by approximately 374 million assuming no change in foreign currency exchange rates 

table of c ontents 

at december 31 2019 and 2018 we maintained interest rate swap agreements on the following floatingrate debt instruments 



 

1 interest rate swap agreements hedging the eurodenominated term loan for harmony of the seas include euribor zerofloors matching the hedged debt euribor zerofloor amount presented is based on the exchange rate as of december 31 2019 

2 interest rate swap agreements hedging the term loan for odyssey of the seas include libor zerofloors matching the hedged debt libor zerofloor the anticipated unsecured term loan for the financing of odyssey of the seas is expected to be drawn in october 2020 

these interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges 

the fair value of our floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements was estimated to be a liability of 654 million as of december 31 2019 based on the present value of expected future cash flows these interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to our ship construction contracts denominated in euros our foreign currency denominated debt and our international business operations on a regular basis we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and from time to time we utilize crosscurrency swap agreements and collar options to manage portions of the exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 

the estimated fair value as of december 31 2019 of our eurodenominated forward contracts associated with our ship construction contracts was a liability of 1392 million based on the present value of expected future cash flows as of december 31 2019 the aggregate cost of our ships on order not including ships on order by our partner brands and the silversea cruises ships that remain contingent upon final documentation and financing was approximately 148 billion of which we had deposited 8815 million as of such date approximately 659 and 535 of the aggregate cost of the ships under construction was exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate at december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively a hypothetical 10 strengthening of the euro as of december 31 2019 assuming no changes in comparative interest rates would result in a 9722 million increase in the united states dollar cost of the foreign currency denominated ship construction contracts exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate our foreign currency forward contract agreements are accounted for as cash flow or net investment hedges depending on the designation of the related hedge 

our international business operations subject us to foreign currency exchange risk we transact business in many different foreign currencies and maintain investments in foreign operations which may expose us to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates movements in foreign currency exchange rates may affect the value of our earnings in foreign currencies and cash flows we manage most of this exposure on a consolidated basis which allows us to take advantage of any natural offsets therefore weakness in one particular currency might be offset by strengths in other currencies over time the extent to which one currency is effective as a natural offset of another currency fluctuates over time in addition some foreign currency exposures have little to no mitigating natural offsets available 

table of c ontents 

we consider our investments in our foreign operations to be denominated in relatively stable currencies and of a longterm nature as of december 31 2019 we maintained foreign currency forward contracts and designated them as hedges of a portion of our net investment in tui cruises of €1730 million or approximately 1942 million based on the exchange rate at december 31 2019 these forward currency contracts mature in october 2021 

we also address the exposure of our investments in foreign operations by denominating a portion of our debt in our subsidiaries and investments functional currencies and designating it as a hedge of these subsidiaries and investments we had designated debt as a hedge of our net investments primarily in tui cruises of approximately €3190 million or approximately 3581 million through december 31 2019 as of december 31 2018 we had designated debt as a hedge of our net investments primarily in tui cruises of approximately €2800 million or approximately 3202 million 

we have included net gains of approximately 968 million and 861 million of foreigncurrency transaction remeasurement and changes in the fair value of derivatives in the foreign currency translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive loss at december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively 

on a regular basis we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and from time to time we utilize crosscurrency swap agreements and collar options to minimize the volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than our functional currency or the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries during 2019 we maintained an average of approximately 6897 million of these foreign currency forward contracts these instruments are not designated as hedging instruments for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 changes in the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts resulted in gains losses of approximately 14 million 624 million and 620 million respectively which offset gains losses arising from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies in those same years of 04 million 576 million an d 756 million respectively these changes were recognized in earnings within other income expense in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss 

fuel price risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates primarily to the consumption of fuel on our ships fuel cost net of the financial impact of fuel swap agreements as a percentage of our total revenues was approximately 64 in 2019 75 in 2018 and 78 in 2017 we use fuel swap agreements to mitigate the financial impact of fluctuations in fuel prices 

as of december 31 2019 we had fuel swap agreements to pay fixed prices for fuel with an aggregate notional amount of approximately 8100 million maturing through 2023 the fuel swap agreements represented 54 of our projected 2020 fuel requirements 30 of our projected 2021 fuel requirements 19 of our projected 2022 fuel requirements and 5 of our projected 2023 fuel requirements these fuel swap agreements are generally accounted for as cash flow hedges the estimated fair value of these contracts at december 31 2019 was estimated to be a liability of 238 million we estimate that a hypothetical 10 increase in our weightedaverage fuel price from that experienced during the year ended december 31 2019 would increase our forecasted 2020 fuel cost by approximately 368 million net of the impact of fuel swap agreements

we target customers across all touch points and identify underlying needs for which guests are willing to pay a premium we rely on various programs and technologies during the cruiseplanning cruising and aftercruise periods aimed at increasing ticket prices onboard revenues and occupancy we have and continue to strategically invest in onboard projects on our ships that we believe drive marketability profitability and improve the guest experience 

global awareness and market penetration 

we increase brand awareness and market penetration of our cruise brands in various ways including the use of communication strategies and marketing campaigns designed to emphasize the qualities of each brand and to broaden the awareness of the brand especially among target groups our marketing strategies include the use of travel agencies traditional media mobile and digital media as well as social media influencers and brand websites our brands engage past and potential guests by collaborating with travel partners and through call centers international offices and international representatives in addition our global brands target repeat guests with exclusive benefits offered through their respective loyalty programs 

we sell and market our global brands royal caribbean international celebrity cruises azamara club cruises and silversea cruises to guests outside of the united states and canada through our commercial teams located in europe asia australia new zealand and mexico we believe that having a local presence in these markets provides us with the ability to react more quickly to local market conditions and better understand our consumer base in each market we further extend our geographic reach with a network of approximately 76  independent international 

representatives located throughout the world covering more than 180  countries historically our focus has been to primarily source guests for our global brands from north america we continue to expand our focus on selling and marketing our cruise brands to guests in countries outside of north america by tailoring itineraries and onboard product offerings to the cultural characteristics and preferences of our international guests in addition we explore opportunities that may arise to acquire or develop brands tailored to specific markets 

passenger ticket revenues generated by sales originating in countries outside of the united states were approximately 39  of total passenger ticket revenues in 2018  41  in 2017  and 45  in 2016  international guests have grown from approximately 22 million  in 2014  to approximately 23 million  in 2018  refer to item 1a risk factors   “ conducting business globally may result in increased costs and other risks” for a discussion of the risks associated with our international operations 

cost efficiency operating expenditures and adequate cash and liquidity 

we have adopted a number of strategies to control our operating costs and will continue to do so in 2019 for example we have adopted numerous initiatives to reduce energy consumption and by extension fuel costs these include the design of more energyefficient ships as well as the implementation of more efficient hardware including improvements in operations and voyage planning as well as improvements to the propulsion machinery hvac and lighting systems the overall impact of these efforts has resulted in an approximate 30 improvement in energy efficiency from 2005 through 2018 and we believe that our energy consumption per guest is currently the lowest in the cruise industry in order to sustain our competitive advantage we will continue to seek to lead with innovative technologies and commit to achieve our short and longterm sustainability goals 

we are focused on maintaining a strong liquidity position investment grade credit metrics and a balanced debt maturity profile we believe these strategies enhance our ability to achieve our overall goal of maximizing our longterm shareholder value 

fleet upgrade maintenance and expansion 

we place a strong focus on innovation which we seek to achieve by introducing new concepts on our new ships and continuously making improvements to our fleet through modernization projects several of these innovations have become signature elements of our brands for the royal caribbean international brand we introduced the “royal promenade” a boulevard with shopping dining and entertainment venues and more recently interior balconies on the oasis class ships and a twolevel family suite on symphony of the seas  for the celebrity cruises brand we enhanced many of the brands design features through the introduction of the solstice class ships more recently with the introduction of celebrity edge  the first ship of a new generation of ships we introduced the magic carpet a cantilevered floating platform that reaches a height of 13 stories above sea level and can serve as a dining venue full bar and platform for live music and newly designed staterooms with an infinite veranda where with the touch of a button the entire living space becomes the veranda 

in 2018 the royal caribbean international and celebrity cruises brands announced the royal amplified and celebrity revolution modernization programs to upgrade vessels across their fleet as part of these modernization programs we incorporate certain innovations included in our newer ships to some of the ships in the remaining fleet the process of integrating some of our latest innovations into our older vessels allows us to create a greater level of consistency of product across our fleet 

as part of the newbuild and modernization programs we also seek to bring innovations in the areas of safety reliability and energy efficiency to our fleet 

we are committed to building stateoftheart ships at a moderate growth rate and we believe our success in this area provides us with a competitive advantage our newer vessels traditionally generate higher revenue yield premiums and are more efficient to operate than older vessels 

as of december 31 2018  our global brands and partner brands have 16  ships on order refer to the operations  section below for further information on our ships on order 

in addition we regularly evaluate opportunities to order new ships purchase existing ships or sell ships in our current fleet in the current environment of high industry demand we recently have placed new ship orders earlier than we have historically done as well as more aggressively sought to sell older capacity 

markets and itineraries 

in an effort to penetrate untapped markets diversify our consumer base and respond to changing economic and geopolitical market conditions we continue to seek opportunities to deploy ships to new and stronger markets and itineraries throughout the world the portability of our ships allows us to deploy our ships to meet demand within our existing cruise markets we make deployment decisions generally 12 to 18 months in advance with the goal of optimizing the overall profitability of our portfolio additionally the infrastructure investments we have made to create a flexible global sourcing model have made our brands relevant in a number of markets around the world which allows us to be opportunistic and source the highest yielding guests for our itineraries 

our ships offer a wide selection of itineraries that call on more than 1000  destinations in 126  countries spanning all seven continents we are focused on obtaining the best possible longterm shareholder returns by operating in established markets while growing our presence in developing markets new capacity allows us to expand into new markets and itineraries our brands have expanded their mix of itineraries while strengthening our ability to further penetrate the asian and australian markets the recent acquisition of silversea cruises adds more than 500 new destinations allowing us to expand and enhance our selection of exotic itineraries additionally in order to provide unique destination experiences to our guests we are investing in our private land destinations for instance in 2018 we announced perfect day island collection  an initiative to develop a series of private island destinations around the world the first in the collection perfect day  at cococay is scheduled to open in spring 2019 and will include a wide range of attractions such as a water park zip line wave and freshwater pools and overwater cabanas to deliver a unique family experience 

also in order to capitalize on the summer season in the southern hemisphere and mitigate the impact of the winter weather in the northern hemisphere our brands have focused on deployment in the caribbean asia and australia during that period 

in an effort to secure desirable berthing facilities for our ships and to provide new or enhanced cruise destinations for our guests we actively assist or invest in the development or enhancement of certain port facilities and infrastructure including mixeduse commercial properties located in strategic ports of call for instance in late 2018 a new cruise terminal of approximately 170000 square feet was completed at portmiami in miami florida serving as one of our homeports generally we collaborate with local private or governmental entities by providing management andor financial assistance and often enter into longterm port usage arrangements our participation in these efforts is generally accomplished via investments with the relevant government authority andor various other strategic partnerships established to develop andor operate the port facilities by providing direct development and management expertise or in certain limited circumstances by providing direct or indirect financial support in exchange for our involvement we generally secure preferential berthing rights for our ships 

technological capabilities 

the need to develop and use innovative technology is increasingly important technology is a pervasive part of virtually every business process we use to support our strategic focus and provide a quality experience to our customers before during and after their cruise 

in the past year we have digitalized the guest journey from port checkin and onboard purchases to digital stateroom features as the use of our various websites mobile and social media platforms continue to increase both on shore and shipboard by both our guests and crew we continually invest in our systems infrastructure and technologies to facilitate this growth for instance in 2018 we continued to advance our onboard technology in areas such as internet connectivity at sea stateroom automation and guesttoguest chat 

additionally we continue to invest in our distribution channels to ensure the best gotomarket approach whether through travel partners or direct to customer commensurate with our destination strategy we intend to invest in technology to service our guests seamlessly as they transition from ship to our private destinations to enjoy internet connectivity or local activities 

cyber security and data privacy are a continued focus and we have made and will continue to make investments to protect our customer data intellectual property and global operations 

travel agency support and consumer outreach 

travel agencies continue to be the primary source of ticket sales for our ships we believe in the value of this distribution channel and invest in maintaining strong relationships with our travel partners to accomplish this goal we seek to ensure that our commission rates and incentive structures remain competitive with the marketplace we provide brand dedicated sales representatives who serve as advisors to our travel partners we also provide trained customer service representatives call centers and online training tools 

in addition we continue to operate our consumer outreach department which provides consumers 24hour access to our vacation planners and customer service agents in our call centers in addition we maintain and invest in our websites including mobile applications and mobile websites which allow guests to directly plan book and customize their cruise including the ability to add a variety of onboard amenities we enable our guests to communicate and book with us through various channels such as phone web chat text message andor email

passengers and capacity 

selected statistical information is shown in the following table see financial presentation  description of certain line items  and selected operational and financial metrics  under item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for definitions 



 

 cruise pricing 

our cruise ticket prices include accommodations and a wide variety of activities and amenities including meals and entertainment prices vary depending on many factors including the destination cruise length stateroom category selected and the time of year the cruise takes place although we grant credit terms in select markets mainly outside of the united states our payment terms generally require an upfront deposit to confirm a reservation with the balance due prior to the sailing our cruises are generally available for sale at least one year in advance and often more than two years in advance of sailing during the selling period of a cruise we continually monitor and adjust our cruise ticket prices for available guest staterooms based on demand with the objective of maximizing net yields 

as we grow our business globally our sale arrangements with travel agents may vary for instance although our direct business is growing at a rapid pace sale arrangements through travel agent charter and group sales are proportionately higher in the china market than in our other markets which are primarily through retail agency and direct sales 

we have developed and implemented enhancements to our reservations system that provide us and our travel partners with additional capabilities making it easier to do business with us 

we offer air transportation to our guests through our air transportation program available in major cities around the world generally air tickets are sold to guests at prices close to cost which vary by gateway and destination 

passenger ticket revenues accounted for approximately 72  of total revenues in 2018  2017  and 2016  

onboard activities and other revenues 

our cruise brands offer modern fleets with a wide array of onboard services amenities and activities which vary by brand and ship while many onboard activities are included in the base price of a cruise we realize additional revenues from among other things gaming the sale of alcoholic and other beverages internet and other telecommunication services gift shop items shore excursions photography spasalon and fitness services art auctions 

retail shops and a wide variety of specialty restaurants and dining options many of these services are available for prebooking prior to embarkation these activities are provided either directly by us or by independent concessionaires from which we receive a percentage of their revenues 

in conjunction with our cruise vacations we offer pre and postcruise hotel packages to our royal caribbean international celebrity cruises azamara club cruises and silversea cruises guests we also offer cruise vacation protection coverage to guests in a number of markets which provides guests with coverage for trip cancellation medical protection and baggage protection onboard and other revenues accounted for approximately 28   of total revenues in 2018  2017  and 2016  

segment reporting 

we control and operate four cruise brands royal caribbean international celebrity cruises azamara club cruises and silversea cruises in addition we have a 50  investment in a joint venture with tui ag which operates the german brand tui cruises a 49  interest in the spanish brand pullmantur and a 36  interest in the chinese brand skysea cruises which ceased cruising operations in september 2018 we believe our brands possess the versatility to enter multiple cruise market segments within the cruise vacation industry although each of our brands has its own marketing style as well as ships and crews of various sizes the nature of the products sold and services delivered by our brands share a common base ie the sale and provision of cruise vacations our brands also have similar itineraries as well as similar cost and revenue components in addition our brands source passengers from similar markets around the world and operate in similar economic environments with a significant degree of commercial overlap as a result our brands have been aggregated as a single reportable segment based on the similarity of their economic characteristics types of consumers regulatory environment maintenance requirements supporting systems and processes as well as products and services provided our chairman and chief executive officer has been identified as the chief operating decisionmaker and all significant operating decisions including the allocation of resources are based upon the analyses of the company as one segment  for financial information see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

employees 

as of december 31 2018  our global brands employed approximately 77000  employees including 70000  shipboard employees as well as 7000  fulltime and 100  parttime employees in our shoreside operations as of december 31 2018  approximately 89  of our shipboard employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements 

insurance 

we maintain insurance on the hull and machinery of our ships with insured values generally equal to the net book value of each ship this coverage is maintained with reputable insurance underwriters from the british scandinavian french united states and other reputable international insurance markets 

we are members of four protection and indemnity pi clubs which are part of a worldwide group of 13 pi clubs known as the international group of pi clubs the “ig” liabilities costs and expenses for illness and injury to crew guest injury pollution and other thirdparty claims in connection with our cruise activities are covered by our pi clubs subject to the clubs’ rules and the limits of coverage determined by the ig pi coverage provided by the clubs is on a mutual basis and we are subject to additional premium calls in the event of a catastrophic loss incurred by any member of the 13 pi clubs whereby the reinsurance limits purchased by the ig are exhausted we are also subject to additional premium calls based on investment and underwriting shortfalls experienced by our own individual insurers 

we maintain war risk insurance for legal liability to crew guests and other third parties as well as for loss or damage to our vessels arising from acts of war including invasion insurrection terrorism rebellion piracy and hijacking our primary war risk coverage is provided by a norwegian war risk insurance association and our excess war risk insurance is provided by our four pi clubs consistent with most marine war risk policies our coverage is subject to cancellation in the event of a change in risk in the event of a war between major powers our primary policies terminate after thirty days’ notice and our excess policies terminate immediately our excess policies are also subject to cancellation after a notice period of seven days in the event of other changes in risk these notice periods allow for premiums to be renegotiated based on changes in risk 

insurance coverage for other exposures such as shoreside property and casualty passenger offvessel directors and officers and network security and privacy are maintained with various global insurance companies 

we do not carry business interruption insurance for our ships based on our evaluation of the risks involved and protective measures already in place as compared to the cost of insurance 

all insurance coverage is subject to certain limitations exclusions and deductible levels in addition in certain circumstances we either selfinsure or coinsure a portion of these risks premiums charged by insurance carriers including carriers in the maritime insurance industry increase or decrease from time to time and tend to be cyclical in nature these cycles are impacted both by our own loss experience and by losses incurred in direct and reinsurance markets we historically have been able to obtain insurance coverage in amounts and at premiums we have deemed to be commercially acceptable no assurance can be given that affordable and secure insurance markets will be available to us in the future particularly for war risk insurance 

trademarks 

we own a number of registered trademarks related to the royal caribbean international celebrity cruises azamara club cruises and silversea cruises cruise brands the registered trademarks include the name “royal caribbean international” and its crown and anchor logo the name “celebrity cruises” and its “x” logo the name “azamara club cruises” and its globe with an “a” logo the name “silversea cruises” and its logo and the names of various cruise ships as well as loyalty program names ship venues and other marketing programs we believe our largest brands trademarks are widely recognized throughout the world and have considerable value the duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country however trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use andor their registrations are properly maintained 

regulation 

our ships are regulated by various international national state and local laws regulations and treaties in force in the jurisdictions in which they operate in addition our ships are registered in the bahamas malta or in the case of our ships operating in the galapagos islands ecuador each ship is subject to regulations issued by its country of registry including regulations issued pursuant to international treaties governing the safety of our ships guests and crew as well as environmental protection each country of registry conducts periodic inspections to verify compliance with these regulations as discussed more fully below ships operating out of ports of call around the world are also subject to inspection by the maritime authorities of that country for compliance with international treaties and local regulations additionally ships operating out of the united states ports are subject to inspection by the united states coast guard for compliance with international treaties and by the united states public health service for sanitary and health conditions our ships are also subject to similar inspections pursuant to the laws and regulations of various other countries our ships visit 

we believe that we are in material compliance with all the regulations applicable to our ships and that we have all licenses necessary to conduct our business health safety security environmental and financial responsibility issues are and we believe will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant government authorities in the united states and internationally from time to time various regulatory and legislative changes may be proposed that could impact our operations and subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 

safety and security regulations 

our ships are required to comply with international safety standards defined in the international convention for safety of life at sea “solas” which among other things establishes requirements for ship design structural features materials construction lifesaving equipment and safe management and operation of ships to ensure guest and crew safety the solas standards are revised from time to time and changes are incorporated into the operation of our ships compliance with these modified standards have not historically had a material effect on our operating costs solas incorporates the international safety management code “ism code” which provides an international standard for the safe management and operation of ships and for pollution prevention the ism code is mandatory for all vessels including passenger vessel operators 

all of our operations and ships are regularly audited by various national authorities and we are required to maintain the relevant certificates of compliance with the ism code 

our ships are subject to various security requirements including the international ship and port facility security code “isps code” which is part of solas and the us maritime transportation security act of 2002 “mtsa” which applies to ships that operate in us ports in order to satisfy these security requirements we implement security measures conduct vessel security assessments and develop security plans the security plans for all of our ships have been submitted to and approved by the respective countries of registry for our ships in compliance with the isps code and the mtsa 

the cruise vessel security and safety act of 2010 which applies to passenger vessels which embark or include port stops within the united states requires the implementation of certain safety design features as well as the establishment of practices for the reporting of and dealing with allegations of crime the cruise industry supported this legislation and we believe that our internal standards are generally as strict or stricter than the law requires a few provisions of the law call for regulations which have not yet been finalized we do not expect the proposed regulations will have a material impact to our operations 

environmental regulations 

we are subject to various international and national laws and regulations relating to environmental protection under such laws and regulations we are generally prohibited from discharging materials other than food waste into the waterways we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations from time to time environmental and other regulators consider more stringent regulations which may affect our operations and increase our compliance costs we believe that the impact of ships on the global environment will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world and accordingly may subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future including the items described below 

our ships are subject to the international maritime organization’s ‘‘imo’’ regulations under the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships the ‘‘marpol regulations’’ and the international convention for the control and management of ships ballast water and sediments ballast water management convention which includes requirements designed to minimize pollution by oil sewage garbage air emissions and the transfer of nonnativenonindigenous species we have obtained the relevant international compliance certificates relating to oil sewage air pollution prevention and ballast water for all of our ships 

the marpol regulations impose global limitations on the sulfur content of emissions emitted by ships operating worldwide to 35 which will be further reduced to 05 beginning in january 2020   we do not expect this reduced limitation will have a material impact to our results of operations largely due to a number of mitigating steps we have taken over the last several years including equipping all of our new ships delivered during or after 2014 with advanced emissions purification aep systems covering all engines and actively developing and testing aep systems on the majority of our remaining fleet 

the marpol regulations also establish special emission control areas ‘‘ecas’’ with stringent limitations on sulfur emissions in these areas there are four established ecas that restrict sulfur emissions the baltic sea the north seaenglish channel certain waters surrounding the north american coast and the waters surrounding puerto rico and the us virgin islands the “caribbean eca” ships operating in these sulfur ecas have been required to reduce their emissions sulfur content from 10 to 01 this reduction has not had a significant impact on our results of operations to date due to the mitigating steps described above 

we continue to implement our aep system strategy both for our ships on order and for the majority of the ships on our fleet as our new ships are delivered they will provide us with additional operational and deployment flexibility from 2014 to 2017 we had in place exemptions for 19 of our ships which applied while they were sailing in the north american and caribbean ecas these exemptions delayed the requirement to comply with the additional sulfur content reduction pending our continued development and deployment of aep systems on these ships by the end of 2018 we completed installations on all ships covered by the exemptions we believe that the learning from our existing endeavors as well as our further efforts with regards to this technology will allow us to continue an effective aep system retrofit strategy for our fleet 

all new ships that began construction after january 1 2016 are required to meet more stringent nitrogen oxide emission limits when operating within the north american and us caribbean sea eca we comply with these rules 

for those relevant ships in service all of our ships under construction are being built to comply with these rules these rules have not had and are not expected to have a significant impact to our operations or costs 

effective july 1 2015 the european commission adopted legislation that requires cruise ship operators with ships visiting ports in the european union to monitor and report on the ship’s annual carbon dioxide emissions starting in 2018 compliance with this regulation did not have a material impact to our costs or results of operations in 2018 additionally in 2019 the imos monitoring and reporting system imo data and collection system which is applicable to all ship itineraries will enter into force while we do not expect compliance with either of these regulations to materially impact our costs or results of operations the legislations both present the new monitoring and reporting requirements as the first step of a staged approach which could ultimately result in additional costs or charges associated with carbon dioxide emissions 

the imo ballast water management convention which came in effect in 2017 requires ships that carry and discharge ballast water to meet specific discharge standards by installing ballast water treatment systems within the next five years compliance with this regulation has not had a material effect on our results of operations and we do not expect the continuing compliance with this regulation to have a material effect on our results of operations 

refer to item 1a risk factors  environmental labor health and safety financial responsibility and other maritime regulations could affect operations and increase costs for further discussion of the risks associated with the regulations discussed above  

consumer financial responsibility regulations 

we are required to obtain certificates from the united states federal maritime commission relating to our ability to satisfy liability in cases of nonperformance of obligations to guests as well as casualty and personal injury as a condition to obtaining the required certificates we generally arrange through our insurers for the provision of surety for our shipoperating companies the required amount is currently 300 million  per operator and is subject to additional consumer price index based adjustments 

we are also required by the united kingdom norway finland and the baltics to establish our financial responsibility for any liability resulting from the nonperformance of our obligations to guests from these jurisdictions in the united kingdom we are currently required by the association of british travel agents to provide performance bonds totaling approximately £74 million  the norwegian travel guarantee fund requires us to maintain performance bonds in varying amounts during the course of the year to cover our financial responsibility in norway finland and the baltics these amounts ranged from nok 44 million  to nok 116 million  during 2018  

certain other jurisdictions also require that we establish financial responsibility to our guests resulting from the nonperformance of our obligations however the related amounts do not have a material effect on our costs 

taxation of the company 

the following is a summary of our principal taxes exemptions and special regimes in addition to or instead of income taxation virtually all jurisdictions where our ships call impose some tax or fee or both based on guest headcount tonnage or some other measure we also collect and remit value added tax vat or sales tax in many jurisdictions where we operate 

our consolidated operations are primarily foreign corporations engaged in the owning and operating of passenger cruise ships in international transportation 

us income taxation 

the following is a discussion of the application of the us federal and state income tax laws to us and is based on the current provisions of the us internal revenue code treasury department regulations administrative rulings court decisions and the relevant state tax laws regulations rulings and court decisions of the states where we have business operations all of the foregoing is subject to change and any such change could affect the accuracy of this discussion 

application of section 883 of the internal revenue code 

we celebrity cruises inc and silversea cruises ltd are engaged in a trade or business in the united states and many of our shipowning subsidiaries depending upon the itineraries of their ships receive income from sources within the united states additionally our united kingdom tonnage tax company is a shipoperating company classified as a disregarded entity for us federal income tax purposes that may earn us source income under section 883 of the internal revenue code certain foreign corporations may exclude from gross income and effectively from branch profits tax as such earnings do not give rise to effectively connected earnings and profits us source income derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships including income from the leasing of such ships 

a foreign corporation will qualify for the benefits of section 883 if in relevant part 1 the foreign country in which the foreign corporation is organized grants an equivalent exemption to corporations organized in the united states and 2 the stock of the corporation or the direct or indirect corporate parent thereof is “primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market” in the united states in the opinion of our us tax counsel drinker biddle  reath llp based on the representations and assumptions set forth in that opinion we celebrity cruises inc and our shipowning subsidiaries with us source shipping income qualify for the benefits of section 883 because we and each of those subsidiaries are incorporated in liberia which is a qualifying country and our common stock is primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market in the united states ie we are a publicly traded corporation in addition in the opinion of drinker biddle and reath llp based on the representations and assumptions set forth in that opinion silversea cruises ltd and its shipowning subsidiaries with us source shipping income qualify for the benefits of section 883 because silversea cruises ltd and each of those subsidiaries is incorporated in bahamas which is a qualifying country and more than 50 of silversea cruises ltd’s shares were indirectly owned through a number of intermediary non us companies by a qualifying individual and such individual and intermediary entities have complied with the relevant document requirements if in the future 1 liberia or bahamas no longer qualify as equivalent exemption jurisdictions and we do not reincorporate in a jurisdiction that does qualify for the exemption or 2 we fail to qualify as a publicly traded corporation we and all of our shipowning or operating subsidiaries that rely on section 883 to exclude qualifying income from gross income would be subject to us federal income tax on their us source shipping income and income from activities incidental thereto 

we believe that most of our income and the income of our shipowning subsidiaries including our uk tonnage tax company which is considered a division for us tax purposes is derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships and therefore is exempt from taxation under section 883 

regulations under section 883 list activities that are not considered by the internal revenue service to be incidental to the international operation of ships including the sale of air and land transportation shore excursions and pre and postcruise tours our income from these activities that is earned from sources within the united states will be subject to us taxation 

taxation in the absence of an exemption under section 883 

if we the operator of our vessels celebrity cruises inc silversea cruises ltd or our shipowning subsidiaries were to fail to meet the requirements of section 883 of the internal revenue code or if the provision was repealed then as explained below such companies would be subject to us income taxation on a portion of their income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships 

because we celebrity cruises inc and silversea cruises ltd conduct a trade or business in the united states we celebrity cruises inc and silversea cruises ltd would be taxable at regular corporate rates on our separate company taxable income ie without regard to the income of our shipowning subsidiaries on income which is effectively connected with our us trade or business generally only income from us sources in addition if any of our earnings and profits effectively connected with our us trade or business were withdrawn or were deemed to have been withdrawn from our us trade or business those withdrawn amounts would be subject to a “branch profits” tax at the rate of 30 we celebrity cruises inc and silversea cruises ltd would also be potentially subject to tax on portions of certain interest paid by us at rates of up to 30 

if section 883 were not available to our shipowning subsidiaries each such subsidiary would be subject to a 

special 4 tax on its us source gross transportation income if any each year because it does not have a fixed place of business in the united states and its income is derived from the leasing of a ship 

other united states taxation 

we celebrity cruises inc and silversea cruises ltd earn us source income from activities not considered incidental to international shipping the tax on such income is not material to our results of operation for all years presented 

state taxation

 item 1a risk factors 

the risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k are important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historical results it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks there may be additional risks that we consider not to be material or which are not known and any of these risks could have the effects set forth below   the ordering of the risk factors set forth below is not intended to reflect any company indication of priority or likelihood see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a cautionary note regarding forwardlooking statements 

adverse worldwide economic or other conditions could reduce the demand for cruises and passenger spending adversely impacting our operating results cash flows and financial condition including potentially impairing the value of our ships and other assets 

the demand for cruises is affected by international national and local economic conditions weak or uncertain economic conditions impact consumer confidence and pose a risk as vacationers may postpone or reduce discretionary spending this in turn may result in cruise booking slowdowns decreased cruise prices and lower onboard revenues given the global nature of our business we are exposed to many different economies and our business could be hurt by challenging conditions in any of our markets any significant deterioration of international national or local economic conditions could result in a prolonged period of booking slowdowns depressed cruise prices and reduced onboard revenues 

fears of terrorist attacks war and other hostilities could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

events such as terrorist attacks war or warlike conditions conflicts domestic or crossborder civil unrest and other hostilities including an escalation in the frequency or severity of incidents and the resulting political instability travel restrictions and advisories and concerns over safety and security aspects of traveling or the fear of any of the foregoing have had and could have in the future a significant adverse impact on demand and pricing in the travel and vacation industry in view of our global operations we are susceptible to a wide range of adverse events these events could also result in additional security measures taken by local authorities which may potentially impact access to ports andor destinations 

our operating costs could increase due to market forces and economic or geopolitical factors beyond our control 

our operating costs including fuel food payroll and benefits airfare taxes insurance and security costs are all subject to increases due to market forces and economic or geopolitical conditions or other factors beyond our control increases in these operating costs could adversely affect our profitability 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates fuel prices and interest rates could affect our financial results 

we are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates fuel prices and interest rates significant changes in any of the foregoing could have a material impact on our financial results net of the impact of our hedging activities and natural offsets our operating results have been and will continue to be impacted often significantly by changes in each of these factors the value of our earnings in foreign currencies is adversely impacted by a strong united states dollar in addition any significant increase in fuel prices could materially and adversely affect our business as fuel prices not only impact our fuel costs but also some of our other expenses such as crew travel freight and commodity prices also a significant increase in interest rates could materially impact the cost of our floating rate debt furthermore regulatory changes such as the announcement of the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority to phase out libor by the end of 2021 may adversely affect our portfolio of floatingrate debt and interest rate derivatives if libor ceases to exist we may need to renegotiate any credit agreements or interest rate derivatives agreements extending beyond 2021 that utilize libor as a factor in determining the interest rate or hedge rate which could adversely impact our cost of debt 

see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” and “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ” for more information 

conducting business globally may result in increased costs and other risks 

we operate our business globally operating internationally exposes us to a number of risks including increased exposure to a wider range of regional and local economic conditions volatile local political conditions potential 

changes in duties and taxes including changing andor uncertain interpretations of existing tax laws and regulations required compliance with additional laws and policies affecting cruising vacation or maritime businesses or governing the operations of foreignbased companies currency fluctuations interest rate movements difficulties in operating under local business environments port quality and availability in certain regions us and global antibribery laws or regulations imposition of trade barriers and restrictions on repatriation of earnings 

our future growth strategies increasingly depend on the growth and sustained profitability of certain international markets such as china some factors that will be critical to our success in developing these markets may be different than those affecting our moreestablished north american and european markets in the chinese market in particular our future success depends on our ability to continue to raise awareness of our products evolve the available distribution channels and adapt our offerings to best suit the chinese consumer china’s economy differs from the economies of other developed countries in many respects and as the legal and regulatory system in china continues to evolve there may be greater uncertainty as to the interpretation and enforcement of applicable laws and regulations in march 2017 chinas national tourism administration issued a directive to travel agents to halt sales of holiday packages to south korea this travel restriction has had a direct impact on our related itineraries impacting the overall performance of our china business it is uncertain what the ultimate scope and duration of this restriction will be but to the extent that this or similar sanctions affecting regional travel andor tourism continues or are put in place it may impact local demand available cruise itineraries and the overall financial performance of the china market 

operating globally also exposes us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal regulatory and tax requirements in many parts of the world including countries in which we operate practices in the local business communities might not conform to international business standards we must adhere to policies designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance as well as applicable laws and regulations however we might not be successful in ensuring that our employees agents representatives and other third parties with whom we associate throughout the world properly adhere to them failure by us our employees or any of these third parties to adhere to our policies or applicable laws or regulations could result in penalties sanctions damage to our reputation and related costs which in turn could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows 

we have operations in and source passengers from the united kingdom and other member countries of the european union in march 2017 the united kingdom notified the european council of its intent to withdraw from the european union since the initial referendum in june 2016 the expected withdrawal has resulted in increased volatility in the global financial markets and in particular in global currency exchange rates the expected withdrawal could potentially adversely affect tax legal and regulatory regimes to which our business in the region is subject the expected withdrawal could also among other potential outcomes disrupt the free movement of goods services and people between the united kingdom and the european union further as the expected withdrawal approaches continued uncertainty around these issues could lead to adverse effects on the economy of the united kingdom including the value of the british pound and the other economies in which we operate making it more difficult to source passengers from these regions these risks may be exacerbated if a structured withdrawal agreement is not ratified before the march 29 2019 deadline andor if voters of other countries within the european union similarly elect to exit the european union in future referendums 

as a global operator our business may be also impacted by changes in us policy or priorities in areas such as trade immigration andor environmental or labor regulations among others depending on the nature and scope of any such changes they could impact our domestic and international business operations any such changes and any international response to them could potentially introduce new barriers to passenger or crew travel andor cross border transactions impact our guest experience andor increase our operating costs for example we are currently monitoring developments in venezuela as well as the us governments recent comments regarding its policy towards cuba and its impact to our business a significant shift in us policy towards cuba including the administration’s possible taking action to limit the ability of companies like us to continue to conduct business in cuba andor a significant deterioration in the cuban economy could impact our cuban itineraries and associated ticket and tour revenues 

in addition the administration has stated it is reviewing whether to continue to suspend the right of private parties to bring litigation under the helmsburton act against companies making unauthorized use of property confiscated by the cuban government if such suspension is lifted monetary and other claims may be brought against us and other companies doing business in cuba although we believe we have meritorious defenses to any such claims it is possible that such claims could lead to an adverse impact on our business 

if we are unable to address these risks adequately our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected including potentially impairing the value of our ships and other assets 

price increases for commercial airline service for our guests or major changes or reduction in commercial airline service andor availability could adversely impact the demand for cruises and undermine our ability to provide reasonably priced vacation packages to our guests 

many of our guests depend on scheduled commercial airline services to transport them to or from the ports where our cruises embark or disembark increases in the price of airfare would increase the overall price of the cruise vacation to our guests which may adversely impact demand for our cruises in addition changes in the availability of commercial airline services could adversely affect our guests’ ability to obtain airfare as well as our ability to fly our guests to or from our cruise ships which could adversely affect our results of operations 

incidents or adverse publicity concerning our ships port facilities land destinations andor passengers or the cruise vacation industry in general unusual weather conditions and other natural disasters or disruptions could affect our reputation as well as impact our sales and results of operations 

the ownership andor operation of cruise ships private destinations port facilities and shore excursions involves the risk of accidents illnesses mechanical failures environmental incidents and other incidents which may bring into question safety health security and vacation satisfaction which could negatively impact our reputation incidents involving cruise ships and in particular the safety health and security of guests and crew and media coverage thereof have impacted and could in the future impact demand for our cruises and pricing in the industry our reputation and our business could also be damaged by negative publicity regarding the cruise industry in general including publicity regarding the spread of contagious disease and the potentially adverse environmental impacts of cruising the considerable expansion in the use of social media and digital marketing over recent years has compounded the potential scope of any negative publicity if any such incident or news cycle occurs during a time of high seasonal demand the effect could disproportionately impact our results of operations for the year in addition incidents involving cruise ships may result in additional costs to our business increasing government or other regulatory oversight and in the case of incidents involving our ships potential litigation 

our cruise ships port facilities and land destinations may also be adversely impacted by weather or natural disasters or disruptions such as hurricanes we are often forced to alter itineraries and occasionally cancel a cruise or a series of cruises or to redeploy our ships due to these types of events which could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability in the current and future periods increases in the frequency severity or duration of severe weather events including those related to climate change could exacerbate their impact and cause further disruption to our operations or make certain destinations less desirable in addition these and any other events which impact the travel industry more generally may negatively impact our ability to deliver guests or crew to our cruises andor interrupt our ability to obtain services and goods from key vendors in our supply chain any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and on industry performance 

an increase in capacity worldwide or excess capacity in a particular market could adversely impact our cruise sales andor pricing 

although our ships can be redeployed cruise sales andor pricing may be impacted by the introduction of new ships into the marketplace reductions in cruise capacity overall market growth and deployment decisions of ourselves and our competitors as of december 31 2018  a total of 89  new ships with approximately 198000  berths are on order for delivery through 2023  in the cruise industry the further net growth in capacity from these new ships and future orders without an increase in the cruise industry’s demand andor share of the vacation market could depress cruise prices and impede our ability to achieve yield improvement 

in addition to the extent that we or our competitors deploy ships to a particular itinerary and the resulting capacity in that region exceeds the demand we may lower pricing and profitability may be lower than anticipated this risk exists in emerging cruise markets such as china where capacity has grown rapidly over the past few years and in mature markets where excess capacity is typically redeployed any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition including potentially impairing the value of our ships and other assets 

unavailability of ports of call may adversely affect our results of operations  

we believe that port destinations are a major reason why guests choose to go on a particular cruise or on a cruise vacation the availability of ports and destinations is affected by a number of factors including existing capacity constraints constraints related to the size of certain ships security environmental and health concerns adverse weather conditions and natural disasters financial limitations on port development exclusivity arrangements that ports may have with our competitors geopolitical developments local governmental regulations and local community concerns about port development and other adverse impacts on their communities from additional tourists and overcrowding in addition fuel costs may adversely impact the destinations on certain of our itineraries 

today certain ports and destinations are facing a surge of both cruise and noncruise tourism which in certain cases has fueled antitourism sentiments and related countermeasures to limit the volume of tourists allowed in these destinations including proposed limits on cruise ships and cruise passengers in 2019 for example the local government of dubrovnik croatia will cap the number of cruise ships that can dock each day to two and the number of corresponding passengers to 5000 similar potential restrictions in ports and destinations such as barcelona venice amsterdam and the norwegian fjords could limit the itinerary and destination options we can offer our passengers going forward 

any limitations on the availability or feasibility of our ports of call or on the availability of shore excursions and other service providers at such ports could adversely affect our results of operations 

our reliance on shipyards their subcontractors and our suppliers to implement our newbuild and ship upgrade programs and to repair and maintain our ships exposes us to risks which if realized could adversely impact our business 

we rely on shipyards their subcontractors and our suppliers to effectively construct our new ships and to repair maintain and upgrade our existing ships on a timely basis and in a cost effective manner 

there are a limited number of shipyards with the capability and capacity to build our new ships increased demand for available new construction slots andor continued consolidation in the cruise shipyard industry could impact our ability to 1 construct new ships when and as planned 2 cause us to continue to commit to new ship orders earlier than we have historically done so andor 3 result in stronger bargaining power on the part of the shipyards and the export credit agencies providing financing for the project our inability to timely and costeffectively procure new capacity could have a significant negative impact on our future business plans and results of operations 

building repairing maintaining andor upgrading a ship is sophisticated work that involves significant risks in addition the prices of labor andor various commodities that are used in the construction of ships can be subject to volatile price changes including the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates shipyards their subcontractors andor our suppliers may encounter financial technical or design problems when doing these jobs if materialized these problems could impact the timely delivery or costs of new ships or the ability of shipyards to repair and upgrade our fleet in accordance with our needs or expectations in addition delays or mechanical faults may result in cancellation of cruises or in more severe situations new ship orders or necessitate unscheduled drydocks and repairs of ships these events and any related adverse publicity could result in lost revenue increased operating expenses or both and thus adversely affect our results of operations 

we may lose business to competitors throughout the vacation market  

we operate in the vacation market and cruising is one of many alternatives for people choosing a vacation we therefore risk losing business not only to other cruise lines but also to other vacation operators which provide other leisure options including hotels resorts internetbased alternative lodging sites and package holidays and tours 

we face significant competition from other cruise lines on the basis of cruise pricing travel agent preference and also in terms of the nature of ships and services we offer to guests our principal competitors within the cruise vacation industry include carnival corporation  plc which owns among others aida cruises carnival cruise line costa cruises cunard line holland america line po cruises princess cruises and seabourn disney cruise line msc cruises and norwegian cruise line holdings ltd which owns norwegian cruise line oceania cruises and regent seven seas cruises our revenues are sensitive to the actions of other cruise lines in many areas including pricing scheduling capacity and promotions which can have a substantial adverse impact not only on our revenues but on overall industry revenues 

in the event that we do not effectively market or differentiate our cruise brands from our competitors or otherwise compete effectively with other vacation alternatives and new or existing cruise companies our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

we may not be able to obtain sufficient financing or capital for our needs or may not be able to do so on terms that are acceptable or consistent with our expectations 

to fund our capital expenditures including new ship orders operations and scheduled debt payments we have historically relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations drawdowns under available credit facilities the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the sale of equity or debt securities in private or public securities markets any circumstance or event which leads to a decrease in consumer cruise spending such as worsening global economic conditions or significant incidents impacting the cruise industry could negatively affect our operating cash flows see “ adverse worldwide economic or other conditions… ” and “ incidents or adverse publicity concerning our ships andor passengers or the cruise vacation industry…” for more information 

although we believe we can access sufficient liquidity to fund our operations investments and obligations as expected there can be no assurances to that effect our ability to access additional funding as and when needed our ability to timely refinance andor replace our outstanding debt securities and credit facilities on acceptable terms and our cost of funding will depend upon numerous factors including but not limited to the vibrancy of the financial markets our financial performance the performance of our industry in general and the size scope and timing of our financial needs in addition even where financing commitments have been secured significant disruptions in the capital and credit markets could cause our banking and other counterparties to breach their contractual obligations to us this could include failures of banks or other financial service companies to fund required borrowings under our loan agreements or to pay us amounts that may become due or return collateral that is refundable under our derivative contracts for hedging of fuel prices interest rates and foreign currencies or other agreements if any of the foregoing occurs it may have a negative impact on our cash flows including our ability to meet our obligations our results of operations and our financial condition 

our liquidity could be adversely impacted if we are unable to satisfy the covenants required by our credit facilities 

our debt agreements contain covenants including covenants restricting our and their ability to take certain actions and financial covenants our ability to maintain our credit facilities may also be impacted by changes in our ownership base more specifically we may be required to prepay our bank financing facilities if any person acquires ownership of more than 50 of our common stock or subject to certain exceptions during any 24month period a majority of our board of directors is no longer comprised of individuals who were members of our board of directors on the first day of such period our public debt securities also contain change of control provisions that would be triggered by a thirdparty acquisition of greater than 50 of our common stock coupled with a ratings downgrade 

failure to comply with the terms of these debt facilities could result in an event of default generally if an event of default under any debt agreement occurs then pursuant to cross default acceleration clauses our outstanding debt and derivative contract payables could become due andor terminated in addition in such events our credit card processors could hold back payments to create a reserve we cannot provide assurances that we would have sufficient liquidity to repay or the ability to refinance the debt if such amounts were accelerated upon an event of default 

if we are unable to appropriately balance our cost management and capital allocation strategies with our goal of satisfying guest expectations it may adversely impact our business success 

our goals call for us to provide high quality products and deliver high quality services there can be no assurance that we can successfully balance these goals with our cost management and capital allocation strategies our business also requires us to make capital allocation decisions such as ordering new ships upgrading our existing fleet enhancing our technology and data capabilities and expanding our portfolio of landbased assets based on expected market preferences competition and projected demand there can be no assurance that our strategies will be successful which could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations investments in older tonnage in particular run the risk of not meeting expected returns and diluting related asset values 

our attempts to expand our business into new markets and new ventures may not be successful 

we opportunistically seek to grow our business through among other things expansion into new destination or source markets and establishment of new ventures complementary to our current offerings these attempts to expand 

our business increase the complexity of our business require significant levels of investment and can strain our management personnel operations and systems there can be no assurance that these business expansion efforts will develop as anticipated or that we will succeed and if we do not we may be unable to recover our investment which could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

our reliance on travel agencies to sell and market our cruises exposes us to certain risks which if realized could adversely impact our business 

we rely on travel agencies to generate the majority of bookings for our ships accordingly we must ensure that our commission rates and incentive structures remain competitive if we fail to offer competitive compensation packages these agencies may be incentivized to sell cruises offered by our competitors to our detriment which could adversely impact our operating results our reliance on thirdparty sellers is particularly pronounced in certain markets such as china where we have a large number of travel agent charter and group sales and less retail agency and direct bookings in addition the travel agent industry is sensitive to economic conditions that impact discretionary income of consumers significant disruptions especially disruptions impacting those agencies that sell a high volume of our business or contractions in the industry could reduce the number of travel agencies available for us to market and sell our cruises which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

disruptions in our shoreside or shipboard operations or our information systems may adversely affect our results of operations 

our principal executive office and principal shoreside operations are located in florida and we have shoreside offices throughout the world actual or threatened natural disasters eg hurricanestyphoons earthquakes tornadoes fires or floods or similar events in these locations may have a material impact on our business continuity reputation and results of operations in addition substantial or repeated information system failures computer viruses or cyberattacks impacting our shoreside or shipboard operations could adversely impact our business we do not generally carry business interruption insurance for our shoreside or shipboard operations or our information systems as such any losses or damages incurred by us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

the loss of key personnel our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel or disruptions among our shipboard personnel due to strained employee relations could adversely affect our results of operations 

our success depends in large part on the skills and contributions of key executives and other employees and on our ability to recruit develop and retain high quality personnel and develop adequate succession plans as demand for qualified personnel in the industry grows we must continue to effectively recruit train motivate and retain our employees both shoreside and on our ships in order to effectively compete in our industry maintain our current business and support our projected global growth 

as of december 31 2018  89  of our shipboard employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements a dispute under our collective bargaining agreements could result in a work stoppage of those employees covered by the agreements we may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate these collective bargaining agreements when they expire in addition existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage on our ships we may also be subject to or affected by work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements any such work stoppages or potential work stoppages could have a material adverse effect on our financial results as could a loss of key employees our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel or disruptions among our personnel 

business activities that involve our coinvestments with third parties may subject us to additional risks 

partnerships joint ventures and other business structures involving our coinvestments with third parties generally include some form of shared control over the operations of the business and create additional risks including the possibility that other investors in such ventures could become bankrupt or otherwise lack the financial resources to meet their obligations or could have or develop business interests policies or objectives that are inconsistent with ours in addition to financial risks our coinvestment activities may also present managerial and operational risks and expose us to reputational or legal concerns these or other issues related to our coinvestments with third parties could adversely impact our operations 

past or pending business acquisitions or potential acquisitions that we may decide to pursue in the future carry inherent risks which could adversely impact our financial performance and condition 

the company from time to time has engaged in acquisitions eg our recent silversea cruises acquisition and may pursue acquisitions in the future which are subject to among other factors the company’s ability to identify attractive business opportunities and to negotiate favorable terms for such opportunities accordingly the company cannot make any assurances that potential acquisitions will be completed timely or at all or that if completed we would realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisition acquisitions also carry inherent risks such as among others 1 the potential delay or failure of our efforts to successfully integrate business processes and realizing expected synergies 2 difficulty in aligning procedures controls andor policies and 3 future unknown liabilities and costs that may be associated with an acquisition in addition acquisitions may also adversely impact our liquidity andor debt levels and the recognized value of goodwill and other intangible assets can be negatively affected by unforeseen events andor circumstances which may result in an impairment charge any of the foregoing events could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on supply chain vendors and thirdparty service providers who are integral to the operations of our businesses these vendors and service providers may be unable or unwilling to deliver on their commitments or may act in ways that could harm our business 

we rely on supply chain vendors to deliver key products to the operations of our businesses around the world any event impacting a vendor’s ability to deliver goods of the required quality at the location and time needed could negatively impact our ability to deliver our cruise experience events impacting our supply chain could be caused by factors beyond the control of our suppliers or us including inclement weather natural disasters increased demand problems in production or distribution andor disruptions in thirdparty logistics or transportation systems interruptions to our supply chain could increase costs and could limit the availability of products critical to our operations 

in order to achieve cost and operational efficiencies we outsource to thirdparty vendors certain services that are integral to the operations of our global businesses such as our onboard concessionaires certain of our call center operations and operation of a large part of our information technology systems we are subject to the risk that certain decisions are subject to the control of our thirdparty service providers and that these decisions may adversely affect our activities a failure to adequately monitor a thirdparty service provider’s compliance with a service level agreement or regulatory or legal requirements could result in significant economic and reputational harm to us there is also a risk the confidentiality privacy andor security of data held by third parties or communicated over thirdparty networks or platforms could become compromised 

if we are unable to keep pace with developments in technology or technological obsolescence our operations or competitive position could become impaired 

our business continues to demand the use of sophisticated technology and systems these technologies and systems require significant investment and must be proven refined updated andor replaced with more advanced systems in order to continue to meet our customers’ demands and expectations if we are unable to do so in a timely manner or within reasonable cost parameters or if we are unable to appropriately and timely train our employees to operate any of these new systems our business could suffer we also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new technology or system which could result in higher than anticipated costs or impair our operating results 

we are exposed to cyberattacks and data breaches including the risks and costs associated with protecting our systems and maintaining integrity and security of our business information as well as personal data of our guests employees and business partners 

we are subject to cyberattacks these cyberattacks can vary in scope and intent from attacks with the objective of compromising our systems networks and communications for economic gain to attacks with the objective of disrupting disabling or otherwise compromising our maritime andor shoreside operations the attacks can encompass a wide range of methods and intent including phishing attacks illegitimate requests for payment theft of intellectual property theft of confidential or nonpublic information installation of malware installation of ransomware and theft of personal or business information the breadth and scope of these attacks as well as the techniques and sophistication used to conduct these attacks have grown over time 

a successful cyberattack may target us directly or it may be the result of a third partys inadequate care in either scenario the company may suffer damage to its systems and data that could interrupt our operations adversely impact our reputation and brand and expose us to increased risks of governmental investigation litigation and other liability any of which could adversely affect our business furthermore responding to such an attack and mitigating the risk of future attacks could result in additional operating and capital costs in systems technology personnel monitoring and other investments 

in addition we are also subject to various risks associated with the collection handling storage and transmission of sensitive information in the course of doing business we collect large volumes of employee customer and other thirdparty data including personally identifiable information and individual credit data for various business purposes we are subject to federal state and international laws including the european union general data protection regulation which took effect in may 2018 as well as industry standards relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of personally identifiable information and individual credit data in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between the company and its subsidiaries and among the company its subsidiaries and other parties with which the company has commercial relations several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with emerging and changing international requirements has caused and may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices if we fail to comply with the various applicable data collection and privacy laws we could be exposed to fines penalties restrictions litigation or other expenses and our business could be adversely impacted 

while we continue to evolve our cybersecurity practices in line with our business reliance on technology and the changing external threat landscape and we invest time effort and financial resources to secure our systems networks and communications our security measures cannot provide absolute assurance that we will be successful in preventing or responding to all cyberattacks for example in september 2018 we discovered instances of unauthorized access to a number of employee email communications some of which contained proprietary business and personally identifiable information we have implemented additional safeguards and we do not believe that we experienced any material losses related to this incident however there can be no assurance that this or any other breach or incident will not have a material impact on our operations and financial results in the future 

any breach theft loss or fraudulent use of guest employee thirdparty or company data could adversely impact our reputation and brand and our ability to retain or attract new customers and expose us to risks of data loss business disruption governmental investigation litigation and other liability any of which could adversely affect our business significant capital investments and other expenditures could be required to remedy the problem and prevent future breaches including costs associated with additional security technologies personnel experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached further if we or our vendors experience significant data security breaches or fail to detect and appropriately respond to significant data security breaches we could be exposed to government enforcement actions and private litigation 

the potential unavailability of insurance coverage an inability to obtain insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates or our failure to have coverage in sufficient amounts to cover our incurred losses may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

we seek to maintain appropriate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates we normally insure based on the cost of an asset rather than replacement value and we also elect to selfinsure coinsure or use deductibles in certain circumstances for certain risks such as loss of use of a ship or a cybersecurity breach the limits of insurance coverage we purchase are based on the availability of the coverage evaluation of our risk profile and cost of coverage accordingly we are not protected against all risks and we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred which could result in an unexpected decrease in our revenue and results of operations in the event of an incident 

we are members of four protection and indemnity pi clubs which are part of a worldwide group of 13 pi clubs known as the international group of pi clubs the “ig” pi coverage provided by the clubs is on a mutual basis and we are subject to additional premium calls in the event of a catastrophic loss incurred by any member of the 13 pi clubs whereby the reinsurance limits purchased by the ig are exhausted we are also subject to additional premium calls based on investment and underwriting shortfalls experienced by our own individual insurers 

we cannot be certain that insurance and reinsurance coverage will be available to us and at commercially reasonable rates in the future or at all or if available that it will be sufficient to cover potential claims additionally if we or other insureds sustain significant losses the result may be higher insurance premiums cancellation of coverage or the inability to obtain coverage such events could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

environmental labor health and safety financial responsibility and other maritime regulations could affect operations and increase operating costs 

the united states and various state and foreign government or regulatory agencies have enacted or may enact environmental regulations or policies such as requiring the use of low sulfur fuels that could increase our direct cost to operate in certain markets increase our cost for fuel limit the supply of compliant fuel cause us to incur significant expenses to purchase andor develop new equipment and adversely impact the cruise vacation industry while we have taken and expect to continue to take a number of actions to mitigate the potential impact of certain of these regulations there can be no assurances that these efforts will be successful or completed on a timely basis 

there is increasing global regulatory focus on climate change greenhouse gas ghg and other emissions these regulatory efforts both internationally and in the united states are still developing and we cannot yet determine what the final regulatory programs or their impact will be in any jurisdiction where we do business however such climate changerelated regulatory activity in the future may adversely affect our business and financial results by requiring us to reduce our emissions purchase allowances or otherwise pay for our emissions such activity may also impact us by increasing our operating costs including fuel costs 

some environmental groups have also lobbied for more stringent regulation of cruise ships and have generated negative publicity about the cruise vacation industry and its environmental impact see item 1 businessregulationenvironmental regulations  

in addition we are subject to various international national state and local laws regulations and treaties that govern among other things discharge from our ships safety standards applicable to our ships treatment of disabled persons health and sanitary standards applicable to our guests security standards on board our ships and at the shipport interface areas and financial responsibilities to our guests these issues are and we believe will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world this could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise ships that could subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 

a change in our tax status under the united states internal revenue code or other jurisdictions may have adverse effects on our income  

we and a number of our subsidiaries are foreign corporations that derive income from a us trade or business andor from sources within the united states drinker biddle  reath llp our us tax counsel has delivered to us an opinion based on certain representations and assumptions set forth in it to the effect that this income to the extent derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships is excluded from gross income for us federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 883 of the internal revenue code we believe that most of our income including that of our subsidiaries is derived from or incidental to the international operation of ships 

our ability to rely on section 883 could be challenged or could change in the future provisions of the internal revenue code including section 883 are subject to legislative change at any time moreover changes could occur in the future with respect to the identity residence or holdings of our direct or indirect shareholders trading volume or trading frequency of our shares or relevant foreign tax laws of liberia such that it no longer qualifies as an equivalent exemption jurisdiction that could affect our eligibility for the section 883 exemption accordingly there can be no assurance that we will continue to be exempt from us income tax on us source shipping income in the future if we were not entitled to the benefit of section 883 we and our subsidiaries would be subject to us taxation on a portion of the income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships which would reduce our net income 

additionally portions of our business are operated by companies that are within the united kingdom tonnage tax regime further some of our operations are conducted in jurisdictions where we rely on tax treaties to provide exemption from taxation to the extent the united kingdom tonnage tax laws change or we do not continue to meet 

the applicable qualification requirements or if tax treaties are changed or revoked we may be required to pay higher income tax in these jurisdictions adversely impacting our results of operations 

as budgetary constraints continue to adversely impact the jurisdictions in which we operate increases in income tax regulations tax audits or tax reform affecting our operations may be imposed 

litigation enforcement actions fines or penalties could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations andor damage our reputation 

our business is subject to various united states and international laws and regulations that could lead to enforcement actions fines civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims and damages in addition improper conduct by our employees agents or joint venture partners could damage our reputation andor lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties including substantial monetary fines in certain circumstances it may not be economical to defend against such matters andor a legal strategy may not ultimately result in us prevailing in a matter such events could lead to an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

we are not a united states corporation and our shareholders may be subject to the uncertainties of a foreign legal system in protecting their interests 

our corporate affairs are governed by our articles of incorporation and bylaws and by the business corporation act of liberia the provisions of the business corporation act of liberia resemble provisions of the corporation laws of a number of states in the united states however while most states have a fairly well developed body of case law interpreting their respective corporate statutes there are very few judicial cases in liberia interpreting the business corporation act of liberia as such the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under liberian law are not as clearly established as the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under statutes or judicial precedent in certain united states jurisdictions for example the right of shareholders to bring a derivative action in liberian courts may be more limited than in united states jurisdictions there may also be practical difficulties for shareholders attempting to bring suit in liberia and liberian courts may or may not recognize and enforce foreign judgments thus our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests with respect to actions by management directors or controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a united states jurisdiction 

provisions of our articles of incorporation bylaws and liberian law could inhibit others from acquiring us prevent a change of control and may prevent efforts by our shareholders to change our management 

certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and liberian law may inhibit third parties from effectuating a change of control of the company without approval from our board of directors which could result in the entrenchment of current management these include provisions in our articles of incorporation that prevent third parties other than a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates from acquiring beneficial ownership of more than 49 of our outstanding shares without the consent of our board of directors

we also operate two private destinations which we utilize as portsofcall on certain itineraries i an island we own in the bahamas which we call cococay and ii labadee a secluded peninsula we lease on the north coast of haiti 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

on september 24 2018 a proposed classaction lawsuit was filed by roger and maureen carretta against royal caribbean cruises ltd dba royal caribbean international in the united states district court for the southern district of florida relating to the marketing and sales of our travel protection program the plaintiffs purported to represent an alleged class of passengers who purchased the travel protection program the complaint alleged that the company concealed that it received kickbacks in the form of undisclosed commissions on the sale of the travel insurance portion of the product from an underwriter and allegedly improperly bundled travel insurance policies with noninsurance products the complaint sought damages in an indeterminate amount on november 26 2018 the court dismissed the entire action with prejudice on the grounds that among others the claim was filed beyond the time limitations contained in the passenger ticket contract plaintiffs did not appeal the decision and the time period for filing an appeal has lapsed 

we are routinely involved in other claims typical within the cruise vacation industry the majority of these claims are covered by insurance we believe the outcome of such claims net of expected insurance recoveries will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations and cash flows

overview 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations have been organized to present the following 



critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap refer to note 1  general  and note 2  summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  certain of our accounting policies are deemed critical as they require managements highest degree of judgment estimates and assumptions we have discussed these accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors we believe our most critical accounting policies are as follows 

ship accounting 

our ships represent our most significant assets and are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization depreciation of ships is generally computed net of a 15 projected residual value using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of the asset which is generally 30 years the 30year useful life of our newly 

constructed ships and 15 associated residual value are both based on the weightedaverage of all major components of a ship our useful life and residual value estimates take into consideration the impact of anticipated technological changes longterm cruise and vacation market conditions and historical useful lives of similarlybuilt ships in addition we take into consideration our estimates of the weightedaverage useful lives of the ships major component systems such as hull superstructure main electric engines and cabins given the very large and complex nature of our ships our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain we do not have cost segregation studies performed to specifically componentize our ship systems therefore we estimate the costs of component systems based principally on general and technical information known about major ship component systems and their lives and our knowledge of the cruise vacation industry we do not identify and track depreciation by ship component systems but instead utilize these estimates to determine the net cost basis of assets replaced or refurbished improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized as additions to the ship and depreciated over the shorter of the improvements estimated useful lives or that of the associated ship the estimated cost and accumulated depreciation of replaced or refurbished ship components are written off and any resulting losses are recognized in cruise operating expenses  

we use the deferral method to account for drydocking costs under the deferral method drydocking costs incurred are deferred and charged to expense on a straightline basis over the period to the next scheduled drydock which we estimate to be a period of thirty to sixty months based on the vessels age as required by class deferred drydock costs consist of the costs to drydock the vessel and other costs incurred in connection with the drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessels class certification class certification is necessary in order for our cruise ships to be flagged in a specific country obtain liability insurance and legally operate as passenger cruise ships the activities associated with those drydocking costs cannot be performed while the vessel is in service and as such are done during a drydock as a planned major maintenance activity the significant deferred drydock costs consist of hauling and wharfage services provided by the drydock facility hull inspection and related activities eg scraping pressure cleaning bottom painting maintenance to steering propulsion thruster equipment and ballast tanks port services such as tugs pilotage and line handling and freight associated with these items we perform a detailed analysis of the various activities performed for each drydock and only defer those costs that are directly related to planned major maintenance activities necessary to maintain class the costs deferred are related to activities not otherwise routinely periodically performed to maintain a vessels designed and intended operating capability repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred 

we use judgment when estimating the period between drydocks which can result in adjustments to the estimated amortization of drydock costs if the vessel is disposed of before the next drydock the remaining balance in deferred drydock is writtenoff to the gain or loss upon disposal of vessel in the period in which the sale takes place we also use judgment when identifying costs incurred during a drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessels class certification as compared to those costs attributable to repairs and maintenance which are expensed as incurred 

we believe we have made reasonable estimates for ship accounting purposes however should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimates of ship useful lives or projected residual values depreciation expense could be materially higher or lower if circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making determinations as to whether ship improvements should be capitalized the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance costs could increase partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense if we had reduced our estimated average ship useful life by one year depreciation expense for 2018  would have increased by approximately 638 million  if our ships were estimated to have no residual value depreciation expense for 2018  would have increased by approximately 2430 million  

business combinations 

on july 31 2018 we acquired a 667  equity stake in silversea cruises for 102 billion  in cash and contingent consideration refer to note 3  business combination  to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for further information on the acquisition 

we account for business combinations in accordance with asc 805 business combinations  by applying the acquisition method of accounting the acquisition method of accounting requires that we record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the noncontrolling interest if any at their respective fair values at the acquisition date goodwill is recognized as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired significant 

estimates and assumptions are made by management to value such assets and liabilities based on third party valuations such as appraisals or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques although we believe that those estimates and assumptions are reasonable and appropriate they are inherently uncertain and subject to change if during the measurement period not to exceed one year additional information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date related to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed we may adjust our estimates to account for subsequent adjustments to the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date resulting in an offsetting adjustment to the goodwill associated with the business acquired 

uncertain tax positions and taxrelated valuation allowances are initially established in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date we continue to collect information and reevaluate these estimates and assumptions quarterly we will record any adjustments to our preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that we are within the oneyear measurement period 

any contingent consideration is estimated at fair value at the acquisition date liabilityclassified contingent consideration is remeasured each reporting period with changes in fair value recognized in earnings until the contingent consideration is settled 

valuation of goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets and longlived assets 

we review goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or when events or circumstances dictate more frequently the impairment review for goodwill consists of a qualitative assessment of whether it is morelikelythannot that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount and if necessary a twostep goodwill impairment test factors to consider when performing the qualitative assessment include general economic conditions limitations on accessing capital changes in forecasted operating results changes in fuel prices and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates if the qualitative assessment demonstrates that it is morelikelythannot that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value it is not necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to step one for any reporting unit in any period on a periodic basis we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed to step one to corroborate the results of recent years qualitative assessments we can resume the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any subsequent period 

when performing the twostep goodwill impairment test the fair value of the reporting unit is determined and compared to the carrying value of the net assets allocated to the reporting unit we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a probabilityweighted discounted cash flow model the estimation of fair value utilizing discounted expected future cash flows includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of expected revenues operating costs marketing selling and administrative expenses interest rates ship additions and retirements as well as assumptions regarding the cruise vacation industrys competitive environment and general economic and business conditions among other factors the principal assumptions we use in the discounted cash flow model are projected operating results weightedaverage cost of capital and terminal value the discounted cash flow model uses the most current projected operating results for the upcoming fiscal year as a base to that base we add future years cash flows assuming multiple revenue and expense scenarios that reflect the impact of different global economic environments beyond the base year on the reporting unit we discount the projected cash flows using rates specific to the reporting unit based on its weightedaverage cost of capital if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value no further analysis or writedown of goodwill is required if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of its net assets the implied fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all its underlying assets and liabilities including both recognized and unrecognized tangible and intangible assets based on their fair value if necessary goodwill is then written down to its implied fair value 

the impairment review for indefinitelife intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount we estimate the fair value of these assets using a discounted cash flow model and various valuation methods depending on the nature of the intangible asset such as the relieffromroyalty method for trademarks and trade names if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess if the fair value exceeds its carrying amount the indefinitelife intangible asset is not considered impaired as of december 31 2018  the carrying amount of indefinitelife intangible assets was 3517 million  which primarily relates to the silversea cruises trade name acquired in the silversea cruises acquisition other intangible assets assigned finite useful lives are amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives refer to note 6  intangible 

assets  to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplemental data for further information on indefinitelife intangible assets 

we review our ships and other longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable we evaluate asset impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities the lowest level for which we maintain identifiable cash flows that are independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities is at the ship level for our ships and prior to the sale of the aircraft at the aggregated asset group level for our aircraft if estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of an asset an impairment charge is recognized to the extent its carrying value exceeds fair value 

we estimate fair value based on quoted market prices in active markets if available if active markets are not available we base fair value on independent appraisals sales price negotiations and projected future cash flows discounted at a rate estimated by management to be commensurate with the business risk quoted market prices are often not available for individual reporting units and for indefinitelife intangible assets accordingly we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit and an indefinitelife intangible asset using an expected present value technique 

royal caribbean international 

during the fourth quarter of 2018  we performed a qualitative assessment of the royal caribbean international reporting unit based on our qualitative assessment we concluded that it was morelikelythannot that the estimated fair value of the royal caribbean international reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and thus we did not proceed to the twostep goodwill impairment test no indicators of impairment exist primarily because the reporting units fair value has consistently exceeded its carrying value by a significant margin and forecasts of operating results expected to be generated by the reporting unit appear sufficient to support its carrying value as of december 31 2018  the carrying amount of goodwill attributable to our royal caribbean reporting unit was 2867 million  

silversea cruises 

the goodwill for the silversea cruises reporting unit was recorded at fair value at july 31 2018 the acquisition date refer to note 3  business combination  to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplemental data for further information on the silversea cruises acquisition during the fourth quarter of 2018  we performed a qualitative assessment of the silversea cruises reporting unit based on our qualitative assessment we concluded that it was morelikelythannot that the estimated fair value of the silversea cruises reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and thus we did not proceed to the twostep goodwill impairment test no indicators of impairment exist primarily because forecasts of operating results expected to be generated by the reporting unit appear sufficient to support its carrying value as of december 31 2018  the carrying amount of goodwill attributable to our silversea cruises reporting unit was 11 billion  

derivative instruments 

we enter into various forward swap and option contracts to manage our interest rate exposure and to limit our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices these instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value and the vast majority are designated as hedges we also use nonderivative financial instruments designated as hedges of our net investment in our foreign operations and investments although certain of our derivative financial instruments do not qualify or are not accounted for under hedge accounting we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes we account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with authoritative guidance refer to note 2  summary of significant accounting policies  and note 17  fair value measurements and derivative instruments  to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for more information on related authoritative guidance the companys hedging programs and derivative financial instruments 

on a regular basis we enter into foreign currency forward contracts interest rate and fuel swaps and options with thirdparty institutions in overthecounter markets we estimate the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps using expected future cash flows based on the instruments contract terms and published forward prices for foreign currency exchange and interest rates we apply present value techniques and libor or euriborbased discount rates to convert the expected future cash flows to the current fair value of the instruments 

we estimate the fair value of our fuel swaps using expected future cash flows based on the swaps contract terms and forward prices we derive forward prices from forward fuel curves based on pricing inputs provided by thirdparty institutions that transact in the fuel indices we hedge we validate these pricing inputs against actual market transactions and published price quotes for similar assets we apply present value techniques and liborbased discount rates to convert the expected future cash flows to the current fair value of the instruments we also corroborate our fair value estimates using valuations provided by our counterparties 

we adjust the valuation of our derivative financial instruments to incorporate credit risk 

we believe it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate and fuel swaps and options would be derived from other appropriate valuation models using similar assumptions inputs or conditions suggested by actual historical experience 

contingencies—litigation 

on an ongoing basis we assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss if any can be made in assessing probable losses we take into consideration estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries if any which are recorded as assets when recoverability is probable we accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recoveries it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made 

seasonality 

our revenues are seasonal based on demand for cruises demand is strongest for cruises during the northern hemispheres summer months and holidays in order to mitigate the impact of the winter weather in the northern hemisphere and to capitalize on the summer season in the southern hemisphere our brands have focused on deployment to the caribbean asia and australia during that period

net cruise costs  and net cruise costs excluding fuel  represent gross cruise costs excluding commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses and in the case of net cruise costs excluding fuel fuel expenses each of which is described above under the description of certain line items  heading in measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income we believe changes in net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance a reconciliation of historical gross cruise costs to net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel is provided below under results of operations for the periods presented net cruise costs excludes the   net gain related to the 51 sale of the pullmantur and cdf brands restructuring charges and other initiative costs related to our pullmantur rightsizing strategy and other restructuring initiatives 

net revenues represent total revenues less commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses each of which is described above under the description of certain line items  heading 

net yields  represent net revenues per apcd we utilize net revenues and net yields to manage our business on a daytoday basis as we believe that they are the most relevant measures of our pricing performance because they reflect the cruise revenues earned by us net of our most significant variable costs which are commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses a reconciliation of historical gross yields to net yields is provided below under results of operations  for the periods presented net yields excludes initiative costs related to the sale of the pullmantur and cdf brands 

occupancy  in accordance with cruise vacation industry practice is calculated by dividing passenger cruise days by apcd a percentage in excess of 100 indicates that three or more passengers occupied some cabins 

passenger cruise days  represent the number of passengers carried for the period multiplied by the number of days of their respective cruises 

we believe net yields net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel are our most relevant nongaap financial measures however a significant portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar because our reporting currency is the united states dollar the value of these revenues and expenses can be affected by changes in currency exchange rates although such changes in local currency prices are just one of many elements impacting our revenues and expenses they can be an important element for this reason we also monitor net yields net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel as if the current periods currency exchange rates had remained constant with the comparable prior periods rates or on a constant currency basis 

it should be emphasized that constant currency is primarily used for comparing shortterm changes andor projections changes in guest sourcing and shifting the amount of purchases between currencies can change the impact of the purely currencybased fluctuations 

the use of certain significant nongaap measures such as net yields net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel allows us to perform capacity and rate analysis to separate the impact of known capacity changes from other less predictable changes which affect our business we believe these nongaap measures provide expanded insight to measure revenue and cost performance in addition to the standard gaap based financial measures there are no specific rules or regulations for determining nongaap and constant currency measures and as such they may not be comparable to other companies within the industry 

we have not provided a quantitative reconciliation of i projected total revenues to projected net revenues ii projected gross yields to projected net yields iii projected gross cruise costs to projected net cruise costs and projected net cruise costs excluding fuel and iv projected net income attributable to royal caribbean cruises ltd and earnings per share to projected adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share because preparation of meaningful gaap projections of total revenues gross yields gross cruise costs net income attributable to royal caribbean cruises ltd and earnings per share would require unreasonable effort due to significant uncertainty we 

are unable to predict without unreasonable effort the future movement of foreign exchange rates fuel prices and interest rates inclusive of our related hedging programs in addition we are unable to determine the future impact of restructuring expenses or other noncore business related gains and losses which may result from strategic initiatives these items are uncertain and could be material to our results of operations in accordance with gaap due to this uncertainty we do not believe that reconciling information for such projected figures would be meaningful

since our earnings release on january 30 2019  bookings have remained consistent with our previous expectations fuel prices and foreign currency exchange rates have fluctuated and are likely to continue to do so accordingly except for the influence of fuel prices and foreign currency exchange rates our forecast remains essentially unchanged 

volatility in foreign currency exchange rates affects the united states dollar value of our earnings based on our highest net exposure for each quarter and the full year 2019  the top five foreign currencies are ranked below for example the australian dollar is the most impactful currency in the first and fourth quarters of 2019  rankings are based on estimated net exposures

future capital commitments 

our future capital commitments consist primarily of new ship orders as of december 31 2018  we have one  oasisclass ship two  quantumclass ships and two  ships of a new generation known as our iconclass on order for our royal caribbean international brand with an aggregate capacity of approximately 25300  berths as of december 31 2018  we have three  edgeclass ships and a ship designed for the galapagos islands on order for our celebrity cruises brand with an aggregate capacity of approximately 9400  berths additionally as of december 31 2018  we have three  ships on order for our silversea cruises brand with an aggregate capacity of approximately 1200  berths refer to item 1 businessoperations for further information on our ships on order for each of these orders we have committed financing arrangements in place covering 80 of the cost of the ship almost all of which include sovereign financing guarantees

contractual obligations 

as of december 31 2018  our contractual obligations were as follows in thousands 



 

1 we are obligated under noncancelable operating leases primarily for offices warehouses and motor vehicles amounts represent contractual obligations with initial terms in excess of one year 

2 debt obligations mature at various dates through fiscal year 2036 and bear interest at fixed and variable rates interest on variablerate debt is calculated based on forecasted debt balances including the impact of interest rate swap agreements using the applicable rate at december 31 2018  debt denominated in other currencies is calculated based on the applicable exchange rate at december 31 2018  

3 amounts primarily represent future commitments with remaining terms in excess of one year to pay for our usage of certain port facilities marine consumables services and maintenance contracts 

4 amounts do not include potential obligations which remain subject to cancellation at our sole discretion and activity related to silversea cruises during the threemonth reporting lag period additionally amounts do not include the conditional agreement with meyer werft for the two silversea cruises ships of a new generation 

 7 amounts represent capital lease obligations with initial terms in excess of one year 

8 amounts represent fees payable to sovereign guarantors in connection with certain of our export credit debt facilities and facility fees on our revolving credit facilities 

please refer to funding needs and sources  below for discussion on the planned funding of the above contractual obligations 

as a normal part of our business depending on market conditions pricing and our overall growth strategy we continuously consider opportunities to enter into contracts for the building of additional ships we may also consider the sale of ships or the purchase of existing ships we continuously consider potential acquisitions and strategic alliances 

if any of these were to occur they would be financed through the incurrence of additional indebtedness the issuance of additional shares of equity securities or through cash flows from operations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we and tui ag have each guaranteed the repayment by tui cruises of 50  of a bank loan as of december 31 2018  the outstanding principal amount of the loan was €370 million  or approximately 423 million  based on the exchange rate at december 31 2018  the loan amortizes quarterly and is currently secured by a first mortgage on mein schiff herz previously known as mein schiff 2  based on current facts and circumstances we do not believe potential obligations under our guarantee of this bank loan are probable 

tui cruises has entered into various ship construction and credit agreements that include certain restrictions on each of our and tui ags ability to reduce our current ownership interest in tui cruises below 3755  through may 2031  

in july 2016 we executed an agreement with miami dade county “mdc” which was simultaneously assigned to sumitomo banking corporation “smbc” to lease land from mdc and construct a new cruise terminal of approximately 170000 square feet at portmiami in miami florida which was completed during the fourth quarter of 2018 and serves as a homeport during the construction period smbc funded the costs of the terminal’s construction and land lease once the terminal was substantially completed we commenced operating and leasing the terminal from smbc for a fiveyear term we determined that the lease arrangement between smbc and us should be accounted for as an operating lease 

some of the contracts that we enter into include indemnification provisions that obligate us to make payments to the counterparty if certain events occur these contingencies generally relate to changes in taxes increased lender capital costs and other similar costs the indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms and are entered into in the normal course of business there are no stated or notional amounts included in the indemnification clauses and we are not able to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments if any under these indemnification clauses we have not been required to make any payments under such indemnification clauses in the past and under current circumstances we do not believe an indemnification obligation is probable 

as of december 31 2018  other than the items described above we are not party to any other offbalance sheet arrangements including guarantee contracts retained or contingent interest certain derivative instruments and variable interest entities that either have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial position 

funding needs and sources 

we have significant contractual obligations of which our debt service obligations and the capital expenditures associated with our ship purchases represent our largest funding needs as of december 31 2018  we had approximately 43 billion  in contractual obligations due through december 31 2019  of which approximately 16 billion  relates to debt maturities 3497 million  relates to interest on longterm debt and 12 billion  relates to progress payments on our ship orders and the final installments payable due upon the deliveries of spectrum of the seas  and celebrity flora  in 2019 we have historically relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations drawdowns under our available credit facilities the incurrence of additional debt andor the refinancing of our existing debt and the issuance of additional shares of equity securities to fund these obligations 

as of december 31 2018  we had a working capital deficit of 59 billion  which included 16 billion  of current portion of debt including capital leases and 7755 million  of commercial paper as of december 31 2017  we had a working capital deficit of 39 billion  which included 12 billion  of current portion of debt including capital leases similar to others in our industry we operate with a substantial working capital deficit this deficit is mainly attributable to the fact that under our business model a vast majority of our passenger ticket receipts are collected in advance of the applicable sailing date these advance passenger receipts remain a current liability until the sailing date the cash generated from these advance receipts is used interchangeably with cash on hand from other sources such as our revolving credit facilities commercial paper and other cash from operations the cash received as advanced receipts 

can be used to fund operating expenses for the applicable future sailing or otherwise pay down our revolving credit facilities and commercial paper notes invest in long term investments or any other use of cash in addition we have a relatively lowlevel of accounts receivable and rapid turnover results in a limited investment in inventories we generate substantial cash flows from operations and our business model along with our unsecured revolving credit facilities has historically allowed us to maintain this working capital deficit and still meet our operating investing and financing needs we expect that we will continue to have working capital deficits in the future 

as of december 31 2018  we had liquidity of 13 billion  consisting of 2879 million  in cash and cash equivalents and 10 billion  available under our unsecured credit facilities net of our outstanding commercial paper notes we anticipate that our cash flows from operations and our current financing arrangements as described above will be adequate to meet our capital expenditures and debt repayments over the next twelvemonth period 

as of december 31 2018  we have 7000 million  that remains available for future common stock repurchase transactions under a 24month common stock repurchase program for up to 10 billion  authorized by our board of directors in may 2018 repurchases under the program may be made at managements discretion from time to time on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and are expected to be funded from available cash or borrowings under our revolving credit facilities refer to note 11  shareholders equity  to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplemental data for further information 

if any person acquires ownership of more than 50 of our common stock or subject to certain exceptions during any 24month period a majority of our board of directors is no longer comprised of individuals who were members of our board of directors on the first day of such period we may be obligated to prepay indebtedness outstanding under our credit facilities which we may be unable to replace on similar terms our public debt securities also contain change of control provisions that would be triggered by a thirdparty acquisition of greater than 50 of our common stock coupled with a ratings downgrade if this were to occur it would have an adverse impact on our liquidity and operations 

debt covenants 

certain of our financing agreements contain covenants that require us among other things to maintain minimum net worth of at least 89 billion  a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 125x and limit our net debttocapital ratio to no more than 625  the fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated by dividing net cash from operations for the past four quarters by the sum of dividend payments plus scheduled principal debt payments in excess of any new financings for the past four quarters our minimum net worth and maximum net debttocapital calculations exclude the impact of accumulated other comprehensive loss on total shareholders equity  we were well in excess of all debt covenant requirements as of december 31 2018  the specific covenants and related definitions can be found in the applicable debt agreements the majority of which have been previously filed with the securities and exchange commission 

dividends 

in december 2018  we declared a cash dividend on our common stock of 070  per share which was paid in the first quarter of 2019  we declared a cash dividend on our common stock of 070  per share during the third quarter of 2018  which was paid in the fourth quarter of 2018  during the first and second quarters of 2018  we declared a cash dividend on our common stock of 060  per share which was paid in the second and third quarters of 2018  respectively during the first quarter of 2018  we also paid a cash dividend on our common stock of 060  per share which was declared during the fourth quarter of 2017  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial instruments and other 

general 

we are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices we try to mitigate these risks through a combination of our normal operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments pursuant to our hedging practices and policies the financial impact of these hedging instruments is primarily offset by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures being hedged we achieve this by closely matching the amount term and conditions of the derivative instrument with the underlying risk being hedged although certain of our derivative financial instruments do not qualify or are not accounted for under hedge accounting our objective is not to hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes refer to note 17  fair value measurements   and derivative instruments to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our longterm debt obligations including future interest payments at december 31 2018  approximately 591  of our longterm debt was effectively fixed as compared to 574  as of december 31 2017  we use interest rate swap agreements to modify our exposure to interest rate movements and to manage our interest expense 

market risk associated with our longterm fixed rate debt is the potential increase in fair value resulting from a decrease in interest rates we use interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a portion of our fixedrate debt to a floatingrate basis to manage this risk at december 31 2018  and 2017  we maintained interest rate swap agreements on the following fixedrate debt instruments 



these interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as fair value hedges 

the estimated fair value of our longterm fixedrate debt at december 31 2018  was 27 billion  using quoted market prices where available or using the present value of expected future cash flows which incorporates risk profile the fair value of our fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements was estimated to be a liability of 254 million  as of december 31 2018  based on the present value of expected future cash flows a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates at december 31 2018  would increase the fair value of our hedged and unhedged longterm fixedrate debt by approximately 1339 million  and would increase the fair value of our fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements by approximately 243 million  

market risk associated with our longterm floatingrate debt is the potential increase in interest expense from an increase in interest rates we use interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a portion of our floatingrate debt to a fixedrate basis to manage this risk a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase our forecasted 2019  interest expense by approximately 357 million  assuming no change in foreign currency exchange rates 

at december 31 2018  and 2017  we maintained interest rate swap agreements on the following floatingrate debt instruments 



 

 these interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges 

the fair value of our floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements was estimated to be an asset of 76 million  as of december 31 2018  based on the present value of expected future cash flows these interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to our ship construction contracts denominated in euros our foreign currency denominated debt and our international business operations on a regular basis we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and from time to time we utilize crosscurrency swap agreements and collar options to manage portions of the exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 

the estimated fair value as of december 31 2018  of our eurodenominated forward contracts associated with our ship construction contracts was a liability of 407 million  based on the present value of expected future cash flows as of december 31 2018  the aggregate cost of our ships on order not including ships on order by our partner brands and the silversea cruises ships that remain contingent upon final documentation and financing was approximately 114 billion  of which we had deposited 6517 million  as of such date approximately 535  and 540  of the aggregate cost of the ships under construction was exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively a hypothetical 10 strengthening of the euro as of december 31 2018  assuming no changes in comparative interest rates would result in a 6090 million  increase in the united states dollar cost of the foreign currency denominated ship construction contracts exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate our foreign currency forward contract agreements are accounted for as cash flow or net investment hedges depending on the designation of the related hedge 

our international business operations subject us to foreign currency exchange risk we transact business in many different foreign currencies and maintain investments in foreign operations which may expose us to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates movements in foreign currency exchange rates may affect the value of our earnings in foreign currencies and cash flows we manage most of this exposure on a consolidated basis which allows us to take advantage of any natural offsets therefore weakness in one particular currency might be offset by strengths in other currencies over time the extent to which one currency is effective as a natural offset of another currency fluctuates over time in addition some foreign currency exposures have little to no mitigating natural offsets available 

we consider our investments in our foreign operations to be denominated in relatively stable currencies and of a longterm nature as of december 31 2018  we maintained foreign currency forward contracts and designated them as hedges of a portion of our net investment in tui cruises of €1010 million  or approximately 1155 million  based on the exchange rate at december 31 2018  these forward currency contracts mature in october 2021  

we also address the exposure of our investments in foreign operations by denominating a portion of our debt in our subsidiaries and investments functional currencies and designating it as a hedge of these subsidiaries and investments we had designated debt as a hedge of our net investments primarily in tui cruises of approximately €2800 million  or approximately 3202 million  through december 31 2018  as of december 31 2017  we had designated debt as a hedge of our net investments primarily in tui cruises of approximately €2460 million  or approximately 2953 million  

we have included approximately 861 million  and 685 million  of foreigncurrency transaction losses and of changes in the fair value of derivatives in the foreign currency translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive loss  at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively 

on a regular basis we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and from time to time we utilize crosscurrency swap agreements and collar options to minimize the volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than our functional currency or the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries during 2018  we maintained an average of approximately 7415 million  of these foreign currency forward contracts these instruments are not designated as hedging instruments for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  changes in the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts resulted in losses gains of approximately 624 million  620 million  and 511 million  respectively which offset gains losses arising from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies in those same years of 576 million  756 million  an d 398 million  respectively these changes were recognized in earnings within other income expense in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss 

fuel price risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates primarily to the consumption of fuel on our ships fuel cost net of the financial impact of fuel swap agreements as a percentage of our total revenues was approximately 75  in 2018  78  in 2017  and 84  in 2016  we use fuel swap agreements to mitigate the financial impact of fluctuations in fuel prices 

as of december 31 2018  we had fuel swap agreements to pay fixed prices for fuel with an aggregate notional amount of approximately 11 billion  maturing through 2022  the fuel swap agreements represented 58  of our projected 2019  fuel requirements 54  of our projected 2020  fuel requirements 28  of our projected 2021  fuel requirements and 19  of our projected 2022  fuel requirements these fuel swap agreements are generally accounted for as cash flow hedges the estimated fair value of these contracts at december 31 2018  was estimated to be an liability of 796 million  we estimate that a hypothetical 10  increase in our weightedaverage fuel price from that experienced during the year ended december 31 2018  would increase our forecasted 2019  fuel cost by approximately 370 million  net of the impact of fuel swap agreements

in 2017 we continued our commitment to control our operating costs and will continue to do so in 2018 for example we continue our initiatives to reduce energy consumption and by extension fuel costs these include the design of more energyefficient ships as well as the implementation of more efficient hardware including improvements in operations and voyage planning as well as improvements to the propulsion machinery hvac and lighting systems the overall impact of these efforts has resulted in an approximate 34 improvement in energy efficiency from 2005 through 2016 and we believe that our energy consumption per guest is currently the lowest in the cruise industry in order to sustain our competitive advantage we will continue to seek innovative technologies 

we are focused on maintaining a strong liquidity position reducing our debt and maintaining investment grade credit metrics we believe these strategies enhance our ability to achieve our overall goal of maximizing our longterm shareholder value 

fleet upgrade maintenance and expansion 

we place a strong focus on innovation which we seek to achieve by introducing new concepts on our new ships and continuously making improvements to our fleet several of these innovations have become signature elements of our brands such as the “royal promenade” a boulevard with shopping dining and entertainment venues for the royal caribbean international brand and enhanced design features found on our solsticeclass ships for the celebrity cruises brand 

our upgrade and maintenance programs enable us to incorporate many of our latest signature innovations throughout the brand fleet and allow us to benefit from economies of scale by leveraging our suppliers ensuring consistency across our fleet provides us with the flexibility to redeploy our ships among our brand portfolio 

we are committed to building stateoftheart ships at a moderate growth rate and we believe our success in this area provides us with a competitive advantage our newer vessels traditionally generate higher revenue yield premiums and are more efficient to operate than older vessels 

our global brands have twelve ships expected to be delivered between 2018 and the end of 2024 these consist of two  quantumclass ships which are scheduled to enter service in the second quarter of 2019 and fourth quarter of 2020 respectively two  oasisclass ships which are scheduled to enter service in the first quarter of 2018 and second quarter of 2021 respectively four ships of a new generation for celebrity cruises which are scheduled to enter service in the fourth quarter of 2018 the second quarter of 2020 and the fourth quarters of 2021 and 2022 respectively a ship designed for the galapagos islands which is scheduled to enter service in the second quarter of 2019 and two ships of a new generation for royal caribbean international which are scheduled to enter service in the second quarters of 2022 and 2024 respectively additionally we entered into an agreement to purchase a ship for azamara club cruises that is scheduled to enter service in the third quarter of 2018 the addition of these ships is expected to increase passenger capacity of our global brands by approximately 42900 berths by the end of 2024 additionally tui cruises our 50 joint venture has agreements for the construction of two new ships which are scheduled to enter service in the second quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 respectively with an expected total capacity of approximately 5700  berths 

in addition we regularly evaluate opportunities to order new ships purchase existing ships or sell ships in our current fleet in the current environment of high industry demand we recently have placed new ship orders earlier than we have historically done as well as more aggressively sought to sell older capacity 

markets and itineraries 

in an effort to penetrate untapped markets diversify our consumer base and respond to changing economic and geopolitical market conditions we continue to seek opportunities to optimally deploy ships to new and stronger markets and itineraries throughout the world the portability of our ships allows us to readily deploy our ships to meet demand within our existing cruise markets we make deployment decisions generally 12 to 18 months in advance with the goal of optimizing the overall profitability of our portfolio additionally the infrastructure investments we have made to create a flexible global sourcing model has made our brands relevant in a number of markets around the world which allows us to be opportunistic and source the highest yielding guests for our itineraries 

our ships offer a wide selection of itineraries that call on approximately 540  destinations in 96  countries spanning all seven continents we are focused on obtaining the best possible longterm shareholder returns by operating in established markets while growing our presence in developing markets new capacity allows us to expand into new markets and itineraries our brands have expanded their mix of itineraries while strengthening our ability to further penetrate the asian and australian markets additionally in order to capitalize on the summer season in the southern hemisphere and mitigate the impact of the winter weather in the northern hemisphere our brands have focused on deployment in the caribbean asia and australia during that period 

in an effort to secure desirable berthing facilities for our ships and to provide new or enhanced cruise destinations for our guests we actively assist or invest in the development or enhancement of certain port facilities and infrastructure including mixeduse commercial properties located in strategic ports of call generally we collaborate with local private or governmental entities by providing management andor financial assistance and often enter into longterm port usage arrangements our participation in these efforts is generally accomplished via investments with the relevant government authority andor various other strategic partnerships established to develop andor operate the port facilities by providing direct development and management expertise or in certain limited circumstances by providing direct or indirect financial support in exchange for our involvement we generally secure preferential berthing rights for our ships 

technological capabilities 

the need to develop and use innovative technology is increasingly important technology is a pervasive part of virtually every business process we use to support our strategic focus and provide a quality experience to our customers before during and after their cruise in the last few years we introduced rfid wow bands on some of our ships to make many onboard processes easier and more comfortable for our guests moreover as the use of our various websites and social media platforms continue to increase along with the use of technology onboard our ships by both our guests and crew we continually need to upgrade our systems infrastructure and technologies to facilitate this growth for instance in 2017 we continued to advance our onboard technology in areas such as internet connectivity at sea guest checkin and dining additionally we have introduced and continue to improve our mobilefriendly websites for our travel partners and direct customers and to invest in mobile apps that enhance the guest experience onboard our ships cyber security and data privacy are a continued focus and we have made and will continue to make significant investments to protect our customer data intellectual property and global operations 

additionally as we expand into new markets we must ensure that we have the proper technology in place to support the market for instance our capabilities need to adapt to each of our markets languages and regulations as we expand our business this has been an increased focus for us 

travel agency support and consumer outreach 

travel agencies continue to be the primary source of ticket sales for our ships we believe in the value of this distribution channel and invest heavily in maintaining strong relationships with our travel partners to accomplish this goal we seek to ensure that our commission rates and incentive structures remain competitive with the marketplace we provide brand dedicated sales representatives who serve as advisors to our travel partners we also provide trained customer service representatives call centers and online training tools 

in addition we continue to operate our consumer outreach department which provides consumers 24hour access to our vacation planners and customer service agents in our call centers in addition we maintain and invest in our websites including mobile applications and mobile websites which allow guests to directly plan book and customize their cruise including the ability to add a variety of onboard amenities 

we also have a robust onboard cruise sales department to help guests to book their next cruise vacations while onboard our ships 

guest services 

we offer to handle virtually all travel aspects related to guest reservations and transportation including arranging guest pre and posthotel stay arrangements and air transportation 

royal caribbean international celebrity cruises and azamara club cruises offer rewards to their guests through their loyalty programs crown  anchor society captain’s club and le club voyage respectively to encourage repeat business crown  anchor society has approximately 128 million  members worldwide captain’s club and le club voyage have approximately 37 million  members combined worldwide members are recognized through increasing membership status by accumulating cruise points or credits depending on the brand which may be redeemed on future sailings members are awarded points or credits in proportion to the number of cruise days and stateroom category the loyalty programs provide certain tiers of membership benefits which entitle guests to upgraded experiences and rewards relative to the status achieved once the guests have accumulated the number of cruise points or credits specified for each tier in addition upon achieving a certain level of cruise points or credits members benefit from reciprocal membership benefits across all of our loyalty programs examples of the rewards available under our loyalty programs include but are not limited to priority ship embarkation priority waitlist for shore excursions complimentary laundry service complimentary internet booklets with onboard discount offers upgraded bathroom amenities private seating on the pool deck ship tours and in the case of our most loyal guests who have achieved the highest levels of cruise points or credits complimentary cruise days we regularly work to enhance each of our loyalty programs by adding

seasonality 

our revenues are seasonal based on the demand for cruises demand is strongest for cruises during the northern hemisphere’s summer months and holidays in order to mitigate the impact of the winter weather in the northern hemisphere and to capitalize on the summer season in the southern hemisphere our brands have focused on deployment in the caribbean asia and australia during that period 

passengers and capacity 

selected statistical information is shown in the following table see financial presentation  description of certain line items  and selected operational and financial metrics  under item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for definitions 



 

 

cruise pricing 

our cruise ticket prices include accommodations and a wide variety of activities and amenities including meals and entertainment prices vary depending on many factors including the destination cruise length stateroom category selected and the time of year the cruise takes place although we grant credit terms in select markets mainly outside of the united states our payment terms generally require an upfront deposit to confirm a reservation with the balance due prior to the sailing our cruises are generally available for sale at least one year in advance and often as much as two years in advance of sailing during the selling period of a cruise we continually monitor and adjust our cruise ticket prices for available guest staterooms based on demand with the objective of maximizing net yields in early 2015 in an effort to preserve the integrity of our cruise pricing we implemented a new policy against introducing incremental discounting on our ticket prices in certain markets within 30 days of the sailing date we continue to follow this policy 

as we grow our business globally our sale arrangements with travel agents may vary for instance our sale arrangements in the mainland chinese market are primarily composed of travel agent charter and group sales with full payment due closein to sailing and to a lesser extent retail agency and direct sales 

we have developed and implemented enhancements to our reservations system that provide us and our travel partners with additional capabilities the enhancements also allow us to better understand and react to the current demand and pricing environment and implement a variety of promotions 

we offer air transportation to our guests through our air transportation program available in major cities around the world generally air tickets are sold to guests at prices close to cost which vary by gateway and destination 

passenger ticket revenues accounted for approximately 72  72  and 73  of total revenues in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

onboard activities and other revenues 

our cruise brands offer modern fleets with a wide array of onboard services amenities and activities which vary by brand and ship while many onboard activities are included in the base price of a cruise we realize additional revenues from among other things gaming the sale of alcoholic and other beverages internet and other telecommunication services gift shop items shore excursions photography spasalon and fitness services art auctions 

retail shops and a wide variety of specialty restaurants and dining options many of these services are available for prebooking prior to embarkation these activities are provided either directly by us or by independent concessionaires from which we receive a percentage of their revenues 

in conjunction with our cruise vacations we offer pre and postcruise hotel packages to our royal caribbean international celebrity cruises and azamara club cruises guests we also offer cruise vacation protection coverage to guests in a number of markets which provides guests with coverage for trip cancellation medical protection and baggage protection onboard and other revenues accounted for approximately 28  28  and 27  of total revenues in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

segment reporting 

we operate three whollyowned cruise brands royal caribbean international celebrity cruises and azamara club cruises in addition we have a 50 investment in a joint venture with tui ag which operates the german brand tui cruises a 49 interest in the spanish brand pullmantur and have a 36 interest in the chinese brand skysea cruises we believe our brands possess the versatility to enter multiple cruise market segments within the cruise vacation industry although each of our brands has its own marketing style as well as ships and crews of various sizes the nature of the products sold and services delivered by our brands share a common base ie the sale and provision of cruise vacations our brands also have similar itineraries as well as similar cost and revenue components in addition our brands source passengers from similar markets around the world and operate in similar economic environments with a significant degree of commercial overlap as a result our brands have been aggregated as a single reportable segment based on the similarity of their economic characteristics types of consumers regulatory environment maintenance requirements supporting systems and processes as well as products and services provided our chairman and chief executive officer has been identified as the chief operating decisionmaker and all significant operating decisions including the allocation of resources are based upon the analyses of the company as one segment  for financial information see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

employees 

as of december 31 2017  our global brands employed approximately 66000  employees including 60000  shipboard employees as well as 6000  fulltime and 100  parttime employees in our shoreside operations as of december 31 2017  approximately 85  of our shipboard employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements 

insurance 

we maintain insurance on the hull and machinery of our ships with insured values generally equal to the net book value of each ship this coverage is maintained with reputable insurance underwriters from the british scandinavian french united states and other reputable international insurance markets 

we are members of three protection and indemnity pi clubs which are part of a worldwide group of 13 pi clubs known as the international group of pi clubs the “ig” liabilities costs and expenses for illness and injury to crew guest injury pollution and other thirdparty claims in connection with our cruise activities are covered by our pi clubs subject to the clubs’ rules and the limits of coverage determined by the ig pi coverage provided by the clubs is on a mutual basis and we are subject to additional premium calls in the event of a catastrophic loss incurred by any member of the 13 pi clubs whereby the reinsurance limits purchased by the ig are exhausted we are also subject to additional premium calls based on investment and underwriting shortfalls experienced by our own individual insurers 

we maintain war risk insurance for legal liability to crew guests and other third parties as well as for loss or damage to our vessels arising from acts of war including invasion insurrection terrorism rebellion piracy and hijacking our primary war risk coverage is provided by a norwegian war risk insurance association and our excess war risk insurance is provided by our three pi clubs consistent with most marine war risk policies our coverage is subject to cancellation in the event of a change in risk in the event of a war between major powers our primary policies 

terminate after thirty days’ notice and our excess policies terminate immediately our excess policies are also subject to cancellation after a notice period of seven days in the event of other changes in risk these notice periods allow for premiums to be renegotiated based on changes in risk 

insurance coverage for shoreside property and casualty exposures shipboard inventory offvessel liability directors and officers and other risks are maintained with various global insurance companies 

we do not carry business interruption insurance for our ships based on our evaluation of the risks involved and protective measures already in place as compared to the cost of insurance 

all insurance coverage is subject to certain limitations exclusions and deductible levels in addition in certain circumstances we either selfinsure or coinsure a portion of these risks premiums charged by insurance carriers including carriers in the maritime insurance industry increase or decrease from time to time and tend to be cyclical in nature these cycles are impacted both by our own loss experience and by losses incurred in direct and reinsurance markets we historically have been able to obtain insurance coverage in amounts and at premiums we have deemed to be commercially acceptable no assurance can be given that affordable and secure insurance markets will be available to us in the future particularly for war risk insurance 

trademarks 

we own a number of registered trademarks related to the royal caribbean international celebrity cruises and azamara club cruises cruise brands the registered trademarks include the name “royal caribbean international” and its crown and anchor logo the name “celebrity cruises” and its “x” logo the name “azamara club cruises” and its globe with an “a” logo and the names of various cruise ships as well as loyalty program names and other marketing programs we believe our largest brands trademarks are widely recognized throughout the world and have considerable value the duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country however trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use andor their registrations are properly maintained 

regulation 

our ships are regulated by various international national state and local laws regulations and treaties in force in the jurisdictions in which they operate in addition our ships are registered in the bahamas malta or in the case of our ships operating in the galapagos islands ecuador each ship is subject to regulations issued by its country of registry including regulations issued pursuant to international treaties governing the safety of our ships guests and crew as well as environmental protection each country of registry conducts periodic inspections to verify compliance with these regulations as discussed more fully below ships operating out of ports of call around the world are also subject to inspection by the maritime authorities of that country for compliance with international treaties and local regulations additionally ships operating out of the united states ports are subject to inspection by the united states coast guard for compliance with international treaties and by the united states public health service for sanitary and health conditions our ships are also subject to similar inspections pursuant to the laws and regulations of various other countries our ships visit 

we believe that we are in material compliance with all the regulations applicable to our ships and that we have all licenses necessary to conduct our business health safety security environmental and financial responsibility issues are and we believe will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant government authorities in the united states and internationally from time to time various regulatory and legislative changes may be proposed that could impact our operations and subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 

safety and security regulations 

our ships are required to comply with international safety standards defined in the international convention for safety of life at sea “solas” which among other things establishes requirements for ship design structural features materials construction lifesaving equipment and safe management and operation of ships to ensure guest 

and crew safety the solas standards are revised from time to time and changes are incorporated into the operation of our ships compliance with these modified standards have not historically had a material effect on our operating costs solas incorporates the international safety management code “ism code” which provides an international standard for the safe management and operation of ships and for pollution prevention the ism code is mandatory for all vessels including passenger vessel operators 

all of our operations and ships are regularly audited by various national authorities and maintain the required certificates of compliance with the ism code 

our ships are subject to various security requirements including the international ship and port facility security code “isps code” which is part of solas and the us maritime transportation security act of 2002 “mtsa” which applies to ships that operate in us ports in order to satisfy these security requirements we implement security measures conduct vessel security assessments and develop security plans the security plans for all of our ships have been submitted to and approved by the respective countries of registry for our ships in compliance with the isps code and the mtsa 

the cruise vessel security and safety act of 2010 which applies to passenger vessels which embark or include port stops within the united states requires the implementation of certain safety design features as well as the establishment of practices for the reporting of and dealing with allegations of crime the cruise industry supported this legislation and we believe that our internal standards are generally as strict or stricter than the law requires a few provisions of the law call for regulations which have not yet been finalized however based on proposed regulations issued by the us coast guard in january 2015 we do not expect any material costs due to implementing these regulations 

environmental regulations 

we are subject to various international and national laws and regulations relating to environmental protection under such laws and regulations we are generally prohibited from discharging materials other than food waste into the waterways we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations from time to time environmental and other regulators consider more stringent regulations which may affect our operations and increase our compliance costs we believe that the impact of ships on the global environment will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world and accordingly may subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future including the items described below 

our ships are subject to the international maritime organization’s ‘‘imo’’ regulations under the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships the ‘‘marpol regulations’’ and the international convention for the control and management of ships ballast water and sediments ballast water management convention which includes requirements designed to minimize pollution by oil sewage garbage air emissions and the transfer of nonnativenonindigenous species we have obtained the relevant international compliance certificates relating to oil sewage air pollution prevention and ballast water for all of our ships 

the marpol regulations impose global limitations on the sulfur content of emissions emitted by ships operating worldwide to 35 the marpol regulations also establish special emission control areas ‘‘ecas’’ with stringent limitations on sulfur emissions in these areas there are four established ecas that restrict sulfur emissions the baltic sea the north seaenglish channel certain waters surrounding the north american coast and the waters surrounding puerto rico and the us virgin islands the “caribbean eca” 

ships operating in these sulfur ecas have been required to reduce their emissions sulfur content from 10 to 01 this reduction has not had a significant impact on our results of operations to date largely due to a number of mitigating steps we have taken over the last several years including equipping all of our new ships delivered during or after 2014 with advanced emissions purification aep systems covering all engines and actively developing and testing aep systems on the majority of our remaining fleet 

we continue to implement our aep system strategy both for our ships on order and for the majority of the ships on our fleet as our new ships are delivered they will provide us with additional operational and deployment flexibility prior to 2017 we had in place exemptions for 19 of our ships which applied while they were sailing in the north american and caribbean ecas these exemptions delay the requirement to comply with the additional sulfur content reduction pending our continued development and deployment of aep systems on these ships by the end of 2017 we completed deployment of the aep system or systems on 17 of the 19 ships covered by the exemptions we believe that the learning from our existing endeavors as well as our further efforts with regards to this technology will allow us to implement an effective aep system retrofit strategy for our fleet 

by january 1 2020 the marpol regulations will require the worldwide limitations on sulfur content on emissions to be reduced from 35 to 05 as this regulation is implemented worldwide and if our mitigation strategies are ineffective including our aep system retrofit strategy our fuel costs could increase significantly 

all new ships that began construction after january 1 2016 are required to meet more stringent nitrogen oxide emission limits when operating within the north american and us caribbean sea eca we have been in the process of evaluating a number of technological alternatives over the last several years to address these new requirements and believe that we will be able to comply with these limits without a significant impact to our operations or fuel costs 

effective july 1 2015 the european commission adopted legislation that requires cruise ship operators with ships visiting ports in the european union to monitor and report on the ship’s annual carbon dioxide emissions starting in 2018 additionally in 2019 the imos monitoring and reporting system imo data and collection system which is applicable to all ship itineraries will enter into force while we do not expect compliance with either of these regulations to materially impact our costs or results of operations the adopting legislations both present the new monitoring and reporting requirements as the first step of a staged approach which could ultimately result in additional costs or charges associated with carbon dioxide emissions 

effective september 8 2017 the imo ballast water management convention requires ships that carry and discharge ballast water to meet specific discharge standards by installing ballast water treatment systems within the next five years we do not expect compliance with this regulation to have a material effect on our results of operations 

consumer financial responsibility regulations 

we are required to obtain certificates from the united states federal maritime commission relating to our ability to satisfy liability in cases of nonperformance of obligations to guests as well as casualty and personal injury as a condition to obtaining the required certificates we arrange through our insurers for the provision of surety for our shipoperating companies the required surety amount is currently 300 million  per operator and is subject to additional consumer price index based adjustments 

we are also required by the united kingdom norway finland and the baltics to establish our financial responsibility for any liability resulting from the nonperformance of our obligations to guests from these jurisdictions in the united kingdom we are currently required by the association of british travel agents to provide performance bonds totaling approximately £44 million  the norwegian travel guarantee fund requires us to maintain performance bonds in varying amounts during the course of the year to cover our financial responsibility in norway finland and the baltics these amounts ranged from nok 39 million  to nok 100 million  during 2017  

certain other jurisdictions also require that we establish financial responsibility to our guests resulting from the nonperformance of our obligations however the related amounts do not have a material effect on our costs 

regulations regarding protection of disabled persons 

in june 2013 the us architectural and transportation barriers compliance board proposed guidelines for the construction and alteration of passenger vessels to ensure that the vessels are readily accessible to and usable by passengers with disabilities once finalized these guidelines will be used by the us department of transportation 

and us department of justice to implement mandatory and enforceable standards for passenger vessels covered by the americans with disabilities act while we believe our vessels have been designed and outfitted to meet the needs of our guests with disabilities we cannot at this time accurately predict whether we will be required to make material modifications or incur significant additional expenses given the uncertainty of the proposed guidelines 

taxation of the company 

the following is a summary of our principal taxes exemptions and special regimes in addition to or instead of income taxation virtually all jurisdictions where our ships call impose some tax or fee or both based on guest headcount tonnage or some other measure 

our consolidated operations are primarily foreign corporations engaged in the owning and operating of passenger cruise ships in international transportation 

us income taxation 

the following is a discussion of the application of the us federal and state income tax laws to us and is based on the current provisions of the us internal revenue code treasury department regulations administrative rulings court decisions and the relevant state tax laws regulations rulings and court decisions of the states where we have business operations all of the foregoing is subject to change and any such change could affect the accuracy of this discussion 

application of section 883 of the internal revenue code 

we and celebrity cruises inc are engaged in a trade or business in the united states and many of our shipowning subsidiaries depending upon the itineraries of their ships receive income from sources within the united states additionally our united kingdom tonnage tax company is a shipoperating company classified as a disregarded entity for us federal income tax purposes that may earn us source income under section 883 of the internal revenue code certain foreign corporations may exclude from gross income and effectively from branch profits tax as such earnings do not give rise to effectively connected earnings and profits us source income derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships including income from the leasing of such ships 

a foreign corporation will qualify for the benefits of section 883 if in relevant part 1 the foreign country in which the foreign corporation is organized grants an equivalent exemption to corporations organized in the united states and 2 the stock of the corporation or the direct or indirect corporate parent thereof is “primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market” in the united states in the opinion of our us tax counsel drinker biddle  reath llp based on the representations and assumptions set forth in that opinion we celebrity cruises inc and our shipowning subsidiaries with us source shipping income qualify for the benefits of section 883 because we and each of those subsidiaries are incorporated in liberia which is a qualifying country and our common stock is primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market in the united states ie we are a publicly traded corporation if in the future 1 liberia no longer qualifies as an equivalent exemption jurisdiction and we do not reincorporate in a jurisdiction that does qualify for the exemption or 2 we fail to qualify as a publicly traded corporation we and all of our shipowning or operating subsidiaries that rely on section 883 to exclude qualifying income from gross income would be subject to us federal income tax on their us source shipping income and income from activities incidental thereto 

we believe that most of our income and the income of our shipowning subsidiaries including our uk tonnage tax company which is considered a division for us tax purposes is derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships and therefore is exempt from taxation under section 883 

regulations under section 883 list activities that are not considered by the internal revenue service to be incidental to the international operation of ships including the sale of air and land transportation shore excursions and pre and postcruise tours our income from these activities that is earned from sources within the united states will be subject 

to us taxation 

taxation in the absence of an exemption under section 883 

if we the operator of our vessels celebrity cruises inc or our shipowning subsidiaries were to fail to meet the requirements of section 883 of the internal revenue code or if the provision was repealed then as explained below such companies would be subject to us income taxation on a portion of their income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships 

because we and celebrity cruises inc conduct a trade or business in the united states we and celebrity cruises inc would be taxable at regular corporate rates on our separate company taxable income ie without regard to the income of our shipowning subsidiaries on income which is effectively connected with our us trade or business generally only income from us sources in addition if any of our earnings and profits effectively connected with our us trade or business were withdrawn or were deemed to have been withdrawn from our us trade or business those withdrawn amounts would be subject to a “branch profits” tax at the rate of 30 we and celebrity cruises inc would also be potentially subject to tax on portions of certain interest paid by us at rates of up to 30 

if section 883 were not available to our shipowning subsidiaries each such subsidiary would be subject to a special 4 tax on its us source gross transportation income if any each year because it does not have a fixed place of business in the united states and its income is derived from the leasing of a ship 

other united states taxation 

we and celebrity cruises inc earn us source income from activities not considered incidental to international shipping the tax on such income is not material to our results of operation for all years presented 

state taxation 

we celebrity cruises inc and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various us state income taxes which are generally imposed on each state’s portion of the us source income subject to federal income taxes additionally the state of alaska subjects an allocated portion of the total income of companies doing business in alaska and certain other affiliated companies to alaska corporate state income taxes and also imposes a 33 tax on adjusted gross income from onboard gambling activities conducted in alaska waters this did not have a material impact to our results of operations for all years presented 

2017 tax cuts and jobs act 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act was signed into law among other things the new legislation reduces the federal corporate income tax rate to 21 from 35 resulting in an immaterial benefit related to the reduction of our us deferred tax liability although there are a number of provisions which apply to us we do not expect any material impact to our overall tax expense as a result of the legislation 

maltese and spanish income taxation 

effective july 31 2016 we sold 51 of our interest in pullmantur holdings we account for our retained investment under the equity method of accounting there was no tax impact to us as a result of this sale transaction the surviving pullmantur company continues to be subject to the tax laws of spain and malta 

under the sale agreement we remain responsible for presale tax matters with respect to years that are still open under the statute of limitations 

united kingdom income taxation 

we operate fifteen ships under companies which have elected to be subject to the united kingdom tonnage tax 

regime “uk tonnage tax” 

companies subject to uk tonnage tax pay a corporate tax on a notional profit determined with reference to the net tonnage of qualifying vessels the requirements for a company to qualify for the uk tonnage tax regime include being subject to uk corporate income tax operating qualifying ships which are strategically and commercially managed in the united kingdom and fulfilling a seafarer training requirement 

relevant shipping profits include income from the operation of qualifying ships and from shipping related activities our uk income from nonshipping activities which do not qualify under the uk tonnage tax regime and which are not considered significant remain subject to uk corporate income tax 

brazilian income taxation 

previously pullmantur and our uk tonnage tax company chartered certain ships to brazilian subsidiary companies for operations in brazil both pullmantur and royal caribbean international ceased charters to brazil in january 2016 and march 2016 respectively while brazilian charters took place the brazilian subsidiaries earnings were subject to brazilian taxation which was not considered significant the charter payments made to the uk tonnage tax company and to pullmantur were exempt from brazilian income tax under brazilian domestic law additionally remittances of revenue from sales of certain cruises in the brazilian market are subject to taxation 

chinese taxation 

our uk tonnage tax company operates ships in international transportation in china the income earned from this operation is exempt from taxation in china under the ukchina double tax treaty and other circulars addressing indirect taxes changes to or failure to qualify for the treaty or circular could cause us to lose the benefits provided which would have a material impact on our results of operations our chinese income from nonshipping activities or from shipping activities not qualifying for treaty or circular protection and which are considered insignificant remain subject to chinese taxation

 item 1a risk factors 

the risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k are important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historical results it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks there may be additional risks that we consider not to be material or which are not known and any of these risks could have the effects set forth below   the ordering of the risk factors set forth below is not intended to reflect any company indication of priority or likelihood see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a cautionary note regarding forwardlooking statements 

adverse worldwide economic or other conditions could reduce the demand for cruises and passenger spending adversely impacting our operating results cash flows and financial condition including potentially impairing the value of our ships and other assets 

the demand for cruises is affected by international national and local economic conditions weak or uncertain economic conditions impact consumer confidence and pose a risk as vacationers may postpone or reduce discretionary spending this in turn may result in cruise booking slowdowns decreased cruise prices and lower onboard revenues given the global nature of our business we are exposed to many different economies and our business could be hurt by challenging conditions in any of our markets any significant deterioration of international national or local economic conditions could result in a prolonged period of booking slowdowns depressed cruise prices and reduced onboard revenues 

fears of terrorist attacks war and other hostilities could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

events such as terrorist attacks war or warlike conditions conflicts domestic or crossborder civil unrest and other hostilities including an escalation in the frequency or severity of incidents and the resulting political instability travel restrictions and advisories and concerns over safety and security aspects of traveling or the fear of any of the foregoing have had and could have in the future a significant adverse impact on demand and pricing in the travel and vacation industry in view of our global operations we are susceptible to a wide range of adverse events these events could also result in additional security measures taken by local authorities which may potentially impact access to ports andor destinations 

our operating costs could increase due to market forces and economic or geopolitical factors beyond our control 

our operating costs including fuel food payroll and benefits airfare taxes insurance and security costs are all subject to increases due to market forces and economic or geopolitical conditions or other factors beyond our control increases in these operating costs could adversely affect our profitability 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates fuel prices and interest rates could affect our financial results 

we are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates fuel prices and interest rates significant changes in any of the foregoing could have a material impact on our financial results net of the impact of our hedging activities and natural offsets our operating results have been and will continue to be impacted often significantly by changes in each of these factors the value of our earnings in foreign currencies is adversely impacted by a strong united states dollar in addition any significant increase in fuel prices could materially and adversely affect our business as fuel prices not only impact our fuel costs but also some of our other expenses such as crew travel freight and commodity prices see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” and “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ” for more information 

conducting business globally may result in increased costs and other risks 

we operate our business globally operating internationally exposes us to a number of risks including increased exposure to a wider range of regional and local economic conditions volatile local political conditions potential 

changes in duties and taxes including changing andor uncertain interpretations of existing tax laws and regulations required compliance with additional laws and policies affecting cruising vacation or maritime businesses or governing the operations of foreignbased companies currency fluctuations interest rate movements difficulties in operating under local business environments port quality and availability in certain regions us and global antibribery laws or regulations imposition of trade barriers and restrictions on repatriation of earnings 

our future growth strategies increasingly depend on the growth and sustained profitability of certain international markets such as china some factors that will be critical to our success in developing these markets may be different than those affecting our moreestablished north american and european markets in the chinese market in particular our future success depends on our ability to continue to raise awareness of our products evolve the available distribution channels and adapt our offerings to best suit the chinese consumer china’s economy differs from the economies of other developed countries in many respects and as the legal and regulatory system in china continues to evolve there may be greater uncertainty as to the interpretation and enforcement of applicable laws and regulations in march 2017 chinas national tourism administration issued a directive to travel agents to halt sales of holiday packages to south korea this travel restriction has had a direct impact on our related itineraries impacting the overall performance of our china business it is uncertain what the ultimate scope and duration of this restriction will be but to the extent that this or similar sanctions affecting regional travel andor tourism continues or are put in place it may impact local demand available cruise itineraries and the overall financial performance of the china market 

operating globally also exposes us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal regulatory and tax requirements in many parts of the world including countries in which we operate practices in the local business communities might not conform to international business standards we must adhere to policies designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance as well as applicable laws and regulations however we might not be successful in ensuring that our employees agents representatives and other third parties with whom we associate throughout the world properly adhere to them failure by us our employees or any of these third parties to adhere to our policies or applicable laws or regulations could result in penalties sanctions damage to our reputation and related costs which in turn could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows 

we have operations in and source passengers from the united kingdom and other member countries of the european union in march 2017 the united kingdom notified the european council of its intent to withdraw from the european union since the initial referendum in june 2016 the expected withdrawal has resulted in increased volatility in the global financial markets and in particular in global currency exchange rates the expected withdrawal could potentially adversely affect tax legal and regulatory regimes to which our business in the region is subject the expected withdrawal could also among other potential outcomes disrupt the free movement of goods services and people between the united kingdom and the european union further as the expected withdrawal approaches continued uncertainty around these issues could lead to adverse effects on the economy of the united kingdom including the value of the british pound and the other economies in which we operate making it more difficult to source passengers from these regions these risks may be exacerbated if voters of other countries within the european union similarly elect to exit the european union in future referendums 

as a global operator our business may be also impacted by changes in us policy or priorities in areas such as trade immigration andor environmental or labor regulations among others depending on the nature and scope of any such changes they could impact our domestic and international business operations any such changes and any international response to them could potentially introduce new barriers to passenger or crew travel andor cross border transactions impact our guest experience andor increase our operating costs 

if we are unable to address these risks adequately our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected including potentially impairing the value of our ships and other assets 

price increases for commercial airline service for our guests or major changes or reduction in commercial airline service andor availability could adversely impact the demand for cruises and undermine our ability to provide reasonably priced vacation packages to our guests 

many of our guests depend on scheduled commercial airline services to transport them to or from the ports where our cruises embark or disembark increases in the price of airfare would increase the overall price of the cruise vacation to our guests which may adversely impact demand for our cruises in addition changes in the availability of commercial airline services could adversely affect our guests’ ability to obtain airfare as well as our ability to fly our guests to or from our cruise ships which could adversely affect our results of operations 

incidents or adverse publicity concerning our ships andor passengers or the cruise vacation industry in general unusual weather conditions and other natural disasters or disruptions could affect our reputation as well as impact our sales and results of operations 

the ownership andor operation of cruise ships private destinations port facilities and shore excursions involves the risk of accidents illnesses mechanical failures environmental incidents and other incidents which may bring into question safety health security and vacation satisfaction which could negatively impact our reputation incidents involving cruise ships and in particular the safety health and security of guests and crew and media coverage thereof have impacted and could in the future impact demand for our cruises and pricing in the industry our reputation and our business could also be damaged by negative publicity regarding the cruise industry in general including publicity regarding the spread of contagious disease and the potentially adverse environmental impacts of cruising the considerable expansion in the use of social media and digital marketing over recent years has compounded the potential scope of any negative publicity if any such incident or news cycle occurs during a time of high seasonal demand the effect could disproportionately impact our results of operations for the year in addition incidents involving cruise ships may result in additional costs to our business increasing government or other regulatory oversight and in the case of incidents involving our ships potential litigation 

our cruise ships and port facilities may also be adversely impacted by weather or natural disasters or disruptions such as hurricanes we are often forced to alter itineraries and occasionally cancel a cruise or a series of cruises or to redeploy our ships due to these types of events which could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability in the current and future periods for example the 2017 hurricane season was particularly impactful to our operations in the caribbean increases in the frequency severity or duration of severe weather events including those related to climate change could exacerbate the impact and cause further disruption to our operations in addition these and any other events which impact the travel industry more generally may negatively impact our ability to deliver guests or crew to our cruises andor interrupt our ability to obtain services and goods from key vendors in our supply chain any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and on industry performance 

an increase in capacity worldwide or excess capacity in a particular market could adversely impact our cruise sales andor pricing 

although our ships can be redeployed cruise sales andor pricing may be impacted by the introduction of new ships into the marketplace reductions in cruise capacity overall market growth and deployment decisions of ourselves and our competitors as of december 31 2017 a total of 75  new ships with approximately 184000  berths are on order for delivery through 2022  in the cruise industry the further net growth in capacity from these new ships and future orders without an increase in the cruise industry’s demand andor share of the vacation market could depress cruise prices and impede our ability to achieve yield improvement 

in addition to the extent that we or our competitors deploy ships to a particular itinerary and the resulting capacity in that region exceeds the demand we may lower pricing and profitability may be lower than anticipated this risk exists in emerging cruise markets such as china where capacity has grown rapidly over the past few years and in mature markets where excess capacity is typically redeployed any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition including potentially impairing the value of our ships and other assets 

unavailability of ports of call may adversely affect our results of operations  

we believe that port destinations are a major reason why guests choose to go on a particular cruise or on a cruise vacation the availability of ports is affected by a number of factors including existing capacity constraints constraints related to the size of certain ships security environmental and health concerns adverse weather conditions and natural disasters financial limitations on port development exclusivity arrangements that ports may have with our competitors local governmental regulations and local community concerns about port development and other adverse impacts on their communities from additional tourists in addition fuel costs may adversely impact the destinations on certain of our itineraries any limitations on the availability or feasibility of our ports of call or on the availability of shore excursions and other service providers at such ports could adversely affect our results of operations 

our reliance on shipyards their subcontractors and our suppliers to implement our newbuild and ship upgrade programs and to repair and maintain our ships exposes us to risks which if realized could adversely impact our business 

we rely on shipyards their subcontractors and our suppliers to effectively construct our new ships and to repair maintain and upgrade our existing ships on a timely basis and in a cost effective manner 

there are a limited number of shipyards with the capability and capacity to build our new ships and accordingly increased demand for available new construction slots andor continued consolidation in the cruise shipyard industry including completion of italian shipbuilder fincantieris bid for stx france could impact our ability to construct new ships when and as planned cause us to continue to commit to new ship orders earlier than we have historically done so andor result in stronger bargaining power on the part of the shipyards and the export credit agencies providing financing for the project our inability to timely and costeffectively procure new capacity could have a significant negative impact on our future business plans and results of operations 

building repairing maintaining andor upgrading a ship is sophisticated work that involves significant risks in addition the prices of labor andor various commodities that are used in the construction of ships can be subject to volatile price changes including the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates shipyards their subcontractors andor our suppliers may encounter financial technical or design problems when doing these jobs if materialized these problems could impact the timely delivery or costs of new ships or the ability of shipyards to repair and upgrade our fleet in accordance with our needs or expectations in addition delays or mechanical faults may result in cancellation of cruises or in more severe situations new ship orders or necessitate unscheduled drydocks and repairs of ships these events and any related adverse publicity could result in lost revenue increased operating expenses or both and thus adversely affect our results of operations 

we may lose business to competitors throughout the vacation market  

we operate in the vacation market and cruising is one of many alternatives for people choosing a vacation we therefore risk losing business not only to other cruise lines but also to other vacation operators which provide other leisure options including hotels resorts internetbased alternative lodging sites and package holidays and tours 

we face significant competition from other cruise lines on the basis of cruise pricing travel agent preference and also in terms of the nature of ships and services we offer to guests our principal competitors within the cruise vacation industry include carnival corporation  plc which owns among others aida cruises carnival cruise line costa cruises cunard line holland america line po cruises princess cruises and seabourn disney cruise line msc cruises and norwegian cruise line holdings ltd which owns norwegian cruise line oceania cruises and regent seven seas cruises our revenues are sensitive to the actions of other cruise lines in many areas including pricing scheduling capacity and promotions which can have a substantial adverse impact not only on our revenues but on overall industry revenues 

in the event that we do not effectively market or differentiate our cruise brands from our competitors or otherwise compete effectively with other vacation alternatives and new or existing cruise companies our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

we may not be able to obtain sufficient financing or capital for our needs or may not be able to do so on terms that are acceptable or consistent with our expectations 

to fund our capital expenditures including new ship orders operations and scheduled debt payments we have historically relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations drawdowns under available credit facilities the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the sale of equity or debt securities in private or public securities markets any circumstance or event which leads to a decrease in consumer cruise spending such as worsening global economic conditions or significant incidents impacting the cruise industry could negatively affect our operating cash flows see “ adverse worldwide economic geopolitical or other conditions… ” and “ incidents or adverse publicity concerning our ships andor passengers or the cruise vacation industry…” for more information 

although we believe we can access sufficient liquidity to fund our operations investments and obligations as expected there can be no assurances to that effect our ability to access additional funding as and when needed our ability to timely refinance andor replace our outstanding debt securities and credit facilities on acceptable terms and our cost of funding will depend upon numerous factors including but not limited to the vibrancy of the financial markets our financial performance the performance of our industry in general and the size scope and timing of our financial needs in addition even where financing commitments have been secured significant disruptions in the capital and credit markets could cause our banking and other counterparties to breach their contractual obligations to us this could include failures of banks or other financial service companies to fund required borrowings under our loan agreements or to pay us amounts that may become due or return collateral that is refundable under our derivative contracts for hedging of fuel prices interest rates and foreign currencies or other agreements if any of the foregoing occurs it may have a negative impact on our cash flows including our ability to meet our obligations our results of operations and our financial condition 

our liquidity could be adversely impacted if we are unable to satisfy the covenants required by our credit facilities 

our debt agreements contain covenants including covenants restricting our ability to take certain actions and financial covenants our ability to maintain our credit facilities may also be impacted by changes in our ownership base more specifically we may be required to prepay our bank financing facilities if any person acquires ownership of more than 50 of our common stock or subject to certain exceptions during any 24month period a majority of the board is no longer comprised of individuals who were members of the board on the first day of such period our public debt securities also contain change of control provisions that would be triggered by a thirdparty acquisition of greater than 50 of our common stock coupled with a ratings downgrade 

our failure to comply with the terms of our debt facilities could result in an event of default generally if an event of default under any debt agreement occurs then pursuant to cross default acceleration clauses our outstanding debt and derivative contract payables could become due andor terminated in addition in such events our credit card processors could hold back payments to create a reserve we cannot provide assurances that we would have sufficient liquidity to repay or the ability to refinance the debt if such amounts were accelerated upon an event of default 

if we are unable to appropriately balance our cost management and capital allocation strategies with our goal of satisfying guest expectations it may adversely impact our business success 

our goals call for us to provide high quality products and deliver high quality services there can be no assurance that we can successfully balance these goals with our cost management and capital allocation strategies our business also requires us to make capital allocation decisions such as ordering new ships andor upgrading our existing fleet based on expected market preferences and projected demand there can be no assurance that our strategies will be successful which could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations investments in older tonnage in particular run the risk of not meeting expected returns and diluting related asset values 

our attempts to expand our business into new markets and new ventures may not be successful 

we opportunistically seek to grow our business through among other things expansion into new destination or source markets and establishment of new ventures complementary to our current offerings these attempts to expand our business increase the complexity of our business require significant levels of investment and can strain our management personnel operations and systems there can be no assurance that these business expansion efforts will develop as anticipated or that we will succeed and if we do not we may be unable to recover our investment which could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

our reliance on travel agencies to sell and market our cruises exposes us to certain risks which if realized could adversely impact our business 

we rely on travel agencies to generate the majority of bookings for our ships accordingly we must ensure that our commission rates and incentive structures remain competitive if we fail to offer competitive compensation packages these agencies may be incentivized to sell cruises offered by our competitors to our detriment which could adversely impact our operating results our reliance on thirdparty sellers is particularly pronounced in certain markets such as china where we have a large number of travel agent charter and group sales and less retail agency and direct booking in addition the travel agent industry is sensitive to economic conditions that impact discretionary income significant disruptions especially disruptions impacting those agencies that sell a high volume of our business or contractions in the industry could reduce the number of travel agencies available for us to market and sell our cruises which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

disruptions in our shoreside or shipboard operations or our information systems may adversely affect our results of operations 

our principal executive office and principal shoreside operations are located in florida and we have shoreside offices throughout the world actual or threatened natural disasters eg hurricanestyphoons earthquakes tornadoes fires or floods or similar events in these locations may have a material impact on our business continuity reputation and results of operations in addition substantial or repeated information systems failures computer viruses or cyberattacks impacting our shoreside or shipboard operations could adversely impact our business we do not generally carry business interruption insurance for our shoreside or shipboard operations or our information systems as such any losses or damages incurred by us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

the loss of key personnel our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel or disruptions among our shipboard personnel due to strained employee relations could adversely affect our results of operations 

our success depends in large part on the skills and contributions of key executives and other employees and on our ability to recruit develop and retain high quality personnel as demand for qualified personnel in the industry grows we must continue to effectively recruit train motivate and retain our employees both shoreside and on our ships in order to effectively compete in our industry maintain our current business and support our projected global growth 

as of december 31 2017 85  of our shipboard employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements a dispute under our collective bargaining agreements could result in a work stoppage of those employees covered by the agreements we may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate these collective bargaining agreements when they expire in addition existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage on our ships we may also be subject to or affected by work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements any such work stoppages or potential work stoppages could have a material adverse effect on our financial results as could a loss of key employees our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel or disruptions among our personnel 

business activities that involve our coinvestment with third parties may subject us to additional risks 

partnerships joint ventures and other business structures involving our coinvestment with third parties generally include some form of shared control over the operations of the business and create additional risks including the possibility that other investors in such ventures could become bankrupt or otherwise lack the financial resources to 

meet their obligations or could have or develop business interests policies or objectives that are inconsistent with ours with the sale of 51 of our interest in pullmantur holdings in july 2016 we continue to expand the breadth of our coinvestment activities which also include tui cruises skysea cruises grand bahama shipyard and minority ownership investments in various port development and other projects in addition to financial risks our coinvestment activities may also present managerial and operational risks and expose us to reputational or legal concerns these or other issues related to our coinvestment with third parties could adversely impact our operations 

we rely on supply chain vendors and thirdparty service providers who are integral to the operations of our businesses these vendors and service providers may be unable or unwilling to deliver on their commitments or may act in ways that could harm our business 

we rely on supply chain vendors to deliver key products to the operations of our businesses around the world any event impacting a vendor’s ability to deliver goods of the required quality at the location and time needed could negatively impact our ability to deliver our cruise experience events impacting our supply chain could be caused by factors beyond the control of our suppliers or us including inclement weather natural disasters increased demand problems in production or distribution andor disruptions in thirdparty logistics or transportation systems interruptions to our supply chain could increase costs and could limit the availability of products critical to our operations 

in order to achieve cost and operational efficiencies we outsource to thirdparty vendors certain services that are integral to the operations of our global businesses such as our onboard concessionaires certain of our call center operations and operation of a large part of our information technology systems we are subject to the risk that certain decisions are subject to the control of our thirdparty service providers and that these decisions may adversely affect our activities a failure to adequately monitor a thirdparty service provider’s compliance with a service level agreement or regulatory or legal requirements could result in significant economic and reputational harm to us there is also a risk the confidentiality privacy andor security of data held by third parties or communicated over thirdparty networks or platforms could become compromised 

a failure to keep pace with developments in technology or technological obsolescence could impair our operations or competitive position 

our business continues to demand the use of sophisticated technology and systems these technologies and systems require significant investment and must be proven refined updated andor replaced with more advanced systems in order to continue to meet our customers’ demands and expectations if we are unable to do so in a timely manner or within reasonable cost parameters or if we are unable to appropriately and timely train our employees to operate any of these new systems our business could suffer we also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new technology or system and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could impair our operating results 

we may be exposed to the threat of cyber attacks andor data breaches including the risks and costs associated with protecting our key operating systems and maintaining integrity and security of our business information as well as personal data of our guests employees and business partners 

cyber attacks can vary in scope and intent from economically driven attacks to malicious attacks targeting our key operating systems with the intent to disrupt disable or otherwise cripple our maritime and or shoreside operations this can include any combination of phishing attacks malware andor viruses targeted at our key systems the breadth and scope of this threat has grown over time and the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyber attacks as well as the sources and targets of the attacks change frequently while we invest time effort and capital resources to secure our key systems and networks our security measures cannot provide absolute assurance that we will be successful in preventing or responding to all such attacks 

a successful cyber attack may target us directly or may be the result of a third party vendors inadequate care in either scenario the company may suffer damage to its key systems andor data that could interrupt our operations adversely impact our reputation and brand and expose us to increased risks of governmental investigation litigation 

and other liability any of which could adversely affect our business furthermore responding to such an attack and mitigating the risk of future attacks could result in additional operating and capital costs in systems technology personnel monitoring and other investments 

in addition to malicious cyber attacks we are also subject to various risks associated with the collection handling storage and transmission of sensitive information in the course of doing business we collect large volumes of internal customer and other thirdparty data including personally identifiable information and individual credit data for various business purposes we are subject to federal state and international laws including the european union general data protection regulation which will take effect in may 2018 as well as industry standards relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of personally identifiable information and individual credit data in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between the company and its subsidiaries and among the company its subsidiaries and other parties with which the company has commercial relations several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with emerging and changing international requirements has caused and may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices if we fail to comply with the various applicable data collection and privacy laws we could be exposed to fines penalties restrictions litigation or other expenses and our business could be adversely impacted 

even if we are fully compliant with legal andor industry standards and any relevant contractual requirements we still may not be able to prevent security breaches involving sensitive data andor critical systems any breach theft loss or fraudulent use of guest employee thirdparty or company data could adversely impact our reputation and brand and our ability to retain or attract new customers and expose us to risks of data loss business disruption governmental investigation litigation and other liability any of which could adversely affect our business significant capital investments and other expenditures could be required to remedy the problem and prevent future breaches including costs associated with additional security technologies personnel experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached further if we or our vendors experience significant data security breaches or fail to detect and appropriately respond to significant data security breaches we could be exposed to government enforcement actions and private litigation 

the potential unavailability of insurance coverage or an inability to obtain insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

we seek to maintain appropriate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates we normally insure based on the cost of an asset rather than replacement value and we also elect to selfinsure coinsure or use deductibles in certain circumstances for certain risks such as loss of use of a ship or a cybersecurity breach the limits of insurance coverage we purchase are based on the availability of the coverage evaluation of our risk profile and cost of coverage accordingly we are not protected against all risks which could result in an unexpected decrease in our revenue and results of operations in the event of an incident 

  

we are members of three protection and indemnity pi clubs which are part of a worldwide group of 13 pi clubs known as the international group of pi clubs the “ig” pi coverage provided by the clubs is on a mutual basis and we are subject to additional premium calls in the event of a catastrophic loss incurred by any member of the 13 pi clubs whereby the reinsurance limits purchased by the ig are exhausted we are also subject to additional premium calls based on investment and underwriting shortfalls experienced by our own individual insurers 

we cannot be certain that insurance and reinsurance coverage will be available to us and at commercially reasonable rates in the future additionally if we or other insureds sustain significant losses the result may be higher insurance premiums cancellation of coverage or the inability to obtain coverage such events could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

environmental labor health and safety financial responsibility and other maritime regulations could affect operations and increase operating costs 

the united states and various state and foreign government or regulatory agencies have enacted or may enact environmental regulations or policies such as requiring the use of low sulfur fuels that could increase our direct cost to operate in certain markets increase our cost for fuel limit the supply of compliant fuel cause us to incur significant expenses to purchase andor develop new equipment and adversely impact the cruise vacation industry while we have taken and expect to continue to take a number of actions to mitigate the potential impact of certain of these regulations there can be no assurances that these efforts will be successful or completed on a timely basis 

there is increasing global regulatory focus on climate change and greenhouse gas ghg emissions these regulatory efforts both internationally and in the united states are still developing and we cannot yet determine what the final regulatory programs or their impact will be in any jurisdiction where we do business however such climate changerelated regulatory activity in the future may adversely affect our business and financial results by requiring us to reduce our emissions purchase allowances or otherwise pay for our emissions such activity may also impact us by increasing our operating costs including fuel costs 

some environmental groups have also lobbied for more stringent regulation of cruise ships and have generated negative publicity about the cruise vacation industry and its environmental impact see item 1 businessregulationenvironmental regulations  

in addition we are subject to various international national state and local laws regulations and treaties that govern among other things discharge from our ships safety standards applicable to our ships treatment of disabled persons health and sanitary standards applicable to our guests security standards on board our ships and at the shipport interface areas and financial responsibilities to our guests these issues are and we believe will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world this could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise ships that could subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 

a change in our tax status under the united states internal revenue code or other jurisdictions may have adverse effects on our income  

we and a number of our subsidiaries are foreign corporations that derive income from a us trade or business andor from sources within the united states drinker biddle  reath llp our us tax counsel has delivered to us an opinion based on certain representations and assumptions set forth in it to the effect that this income to the extent derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships is excluded from gross income for us federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 883 of the internal revenue code we believe that most of our income including that of our subsidiaries is derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships 

our ability to rely on section 883 could be challenged or could change in the future provisions of the internal revenue code including section 883 are subject to legislative change at any time moreover changes could occur in the future with respect to the identity residence or holdings of our direct or indirect shareholders trading volume or trading frequency of our shares or relevant foreign tax laws of liberia such that it no longer qualifies as an equivalent exemption jurisdiction that could affect our eligibility for the section 883 exemption accordingly there can be no assurance that we will continue to be exempt from us income tax on us source shipping income in the future if we were not entitled to the benefit of section 883 we and our subsidiaries would be subject to us taxation on a portion of the income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships which would reduce our net income 

additionally portions of our business are operated by companies that are within the united kingdom tonnage tax regime further some of our operations are conducted in jurisdictions where we rely on tax treaties to provide exemption from taxation to the extent the united kingdom tonnage tax laws change or we do not continue to meet the applicable qualification requirements or if tax treaties are changed or revoked we may be required to pay higher income tax in these jurisdictions adversely impacting our results of operations 

as budgetary constraints continue to adversely impact the jurisdictions in which we operate increases in income tax regulations tax audits or tax reform affecting our operations may be imposed 

litigation enforcement actions fines or penalties could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations andor damage our reputation 

our business is subject to various united states and international laws and regulations that could lead to enforcement actions fines civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims and damages in addition improper conduct by our employees agents or joint venture partners could damage our reputation andor lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties including substantial monetary fines in certain circumstances it may not be economical to defend against such matters andor a legal strategy may not ultimately result in us prevailing in a matter such events could lead to an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

we are not a united states corporation and our shareholders may be subject to the uncertainties of a foreign legal system in protecting their interests 

our corporate affairs are governed by our articles of incorporation and bylaws and by the business corporation act of liberia the provisions of the business corporation act of liberia resemble provisions of the corporation laws of a number of states in the united states however while most states have a fairly well developed body of case law interpreting their respective corporate statutes there are very few judicial cases in liberia interpreting the business corporation act of liberia as such the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under liberian law are not as clearly established as the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under statutes or judicial precedent in certain united states jurisdictions for example the right of shareholders to bring a derivative action in liberian courts may be more limited than in united states jurisdictions there may also be practical difficulties for shareholders attempting to bring suit in liberia and liberian courts may or may not recognize and enforce foreign judgments thus our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests with respect to actions by management directors or controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a united states jurisdiction 

provisions of our articles of incorporation bylaws and liberian law could inhibit others from acquiring us prevent a change of control and may prevent efforts by our shareholders to change our management 

certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and liberian law may inhibit third parties from effectuating a change of control of the company without board approval which could result in the entrenchment of current management these include provisions in our articles of incorporation that prevent third parties other than a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates from acquiring beneficial ownership of more than 49 of our outstanding shares without the consent of our board of directors

overview 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations have been organized to present the following 



critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap refer to note 1 general  and note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  certain of our accounting policies are deemed critical as they require managements highest degree of judgment estimates and assumptions we have discussed these accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors we believe our most critical accounting policies are as follows 

ship accounting 

our ships represent our most significant assets and are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization depreciation of ships is generally computed net of a 15 projected residual value using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of the asset which is generally 30 years the 30year useful life of our newly constructed ships and 15 associated residual value are both based on the weightedaverage of all major components 

of a ship our useful life and residual value estimates take into consideration the impact of anticipated technological changes longterm cruise and vacation market conditions and historical useful lives of similarlybuilt ships in addition we take into consideration our estimates of the weightedaverage useful lives of the ships major component systems such as hull superstructure main electric engines and cabins given the very large and complex nature of our ships our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain we do not have cost segregation studies performed to specifically componentize our ship systems therefore we estimate the costs of component systems based principally on general and technical information known about major ship component systems and their lives and our knowledge of the cruise vacation industry we do not identify and track depreciation by ship component systems but instead utilize these estimates to determine the net cost basis of assets replaced or refurbished improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized as additions to the ship and depreciated over the shorter of the improvements estimated useful lives or that of the associated ship the estimated cost and accumulated depreciation of replaced or refurbished ship components are written off and any resulting losses are recognized in cruise operating expenses  

we use the deferral method to account for drydocking costs under the deferral method drydocking costs incurred are deferred and charged to expense on a straightline basis over the period to the next scheduled drydock which we estimate to be a period of thirty to sixty months based on the vessels age as required by class deferred drydock costs consist of the costs to drydock the vessel and other costs incurred in connection with the drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessels class certification class certification is necessary in order for our cruise ships to be flagged in a specific country obtain liability insurance and legally operate as passenger cruise ships the activities associated with those drydocking costs cannot be performed while the vessel is in service and as such are done during a drydock as a planned major maintenance activity the significant deferred drydock costs consist of hauling and wharfage services provided by the drydock facility hull inspection and related activities eg scraping pressure cleaning bottom painting maintenance to steering propulsion thruster equipment and ballast tanks port services such as tugs pilotage and line handling and freight associated with these items we perform a detailed analysis of the various activities performed for each drydock and only defer those costs that are directly related to planned major maintenance activities necessary to maintain class the costs deferred are related to activities not otherwise routinely periodically performed to maintain a vessels designed and intended operating capability repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred 

we use judgment when estimating the period between drydocks which can result in adjustments to the estimated amortization of drydock costs if the vessel is disposed of before the next drydock the remaining balance in deferred drydock is writtenoff to the gain or loss upon disposal of vessel in the period in which the sale takes place we also use judgment when identifying costs incurred during a drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessels class certification as compared to those costs attributable to repairs and maintenance which are expensed as incurred 

we believe we have made reasonable estimates for ship accounting purposes however should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimates of ship useful lives or projected residual values depreciation expense could be materially higher or lower if circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making determinations as to whether ship improvements should be capitalized the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance costs could increase partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense if we had reduced our estimated average ship useful life by one year depreciation expense for 2017  would have increased by approximately 515 million  if our ships were estimated to have no residual value depreciation expense for 2017  would have increased by approximately 2155 million  

valuation of goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets and longlived assets 

we review goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or when events or circumstances dictate more frequently the impairment review for goodwill consists of a qualitative assessment of whether it is morelikelythannot that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount and if necessary a twostep goodwill impairment test factors to consider when performing the qualitative assessment include general economic conditions limitations on accessing capital changes in forecasted operating results changes in fuel prices and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates if the qualitative assessment demonstrates that it is morelikelythannot that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value it is not necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to step 

one for any reporting unit in any period on a periodic basis we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed to step one to corroborate the results of recent years qualitative assessments we can resume the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any subsequent period 

when performing the twostep goodwill impairment test the fair value of the reporting unit is determined and compared to the carrying value of the net assets allocated to the reporting unit we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a probabilityweighted discounted cash flow model the estimation of fair value utilizing discounted expected future cash flows includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of expected revenues operating costs marketing selling and administrative expenses interest rates ship additions and retirements as well as assumptions regarding the cruise vacation industrys competitive environment and general economic and business conditions among other factors the principal assumptions we use in the discounted cash flow model are projected operating results weightedaverage cost of capital and terminal value the discounted cash flow model uses the most current projected operating results for the upcoming fiscal year as a base to that base we add future years cash flows assuming multiple revenue and expense scenarios that reflect the impact of different global economic environments beyond the base year on the reporting unit we discount the projected cash flows using rates specific to the reporting unit based on its weightedaverage cost of capital if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value no further analysis or writedown of goodwill is required if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of its net assets the implied fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all its underlying assets and liabilities including both recognized and unrecognized tangible and intangible assets based on their fair value if necessary goodwill is then written down to its implied fair value 

the impairment review for indefinitelife intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount we estimate the fair value of these assets using a discounted cash flow model and various valuation methods depending on the nature of the intangible asset such as the relieffromroyalty method for trademarks and tradenames if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess if the fair value exceeds its carrying amount the indefinitelife intangible asset is not considered impaired as of december 31 2017  the carrying amount of indefinitelife intangible assets was not material other intangible assets assigned finite useful lives are amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives 

we review our ships and other longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable we evaluate asset impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities the lowest level for which we maintain identifiable cash flows that are independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities is at the ship level for our ships and prior to the sale of the aircraft at the aggregated asset group level for our aircraft if estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of an asset an impairment charge is recognized to the extent its carrying value exceeds fair value 

we estimate fair value based on quoted market prices in active markets if available if active markets are not available we base fair value on independent appraisals sales price negotiations and projected future cash flows discounted at a rate estimated by management to be commensurate with the business risk quoted market prices are often not available for individual reporting units and for indefinitelife intangible assets accordingly we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit and an indefinitelife intangible asset using an expected present value technique 

royal caribbean international 

during the fourth quarter of 2017  we performed a qualitative assessment of the royal caribbean international reporting unit based on our qualitative assessment we concluded that it was morelikelythannot that the estimated fair value of the royal caribbean international reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and thus we did not proceed to the twostep goodwill impairment test no indicators of impairment exist primarily because the reporting units fair value has consistently exceeded its carrying value by a significant margin and forecasts of operating results generated by the reporting unit appear sufficient to support its carrying value as of december 31 2017  the carrying amount of goodwill attributable to our royal caribbean reporting unit was 2869 million  

2015 impairment of pullmantur related assets 

during the third quarter of 2015 we performed an interim impairment evaluation of pullmantur’s goodwill and trademarks and trade names in connection with the preparation of our financial statements as a result of this analysis we determined that the carrying value of the pullmantur reporting unit exceeded its fair value similarly we determined that the carrying value of pullmantur’s trademarks and trade names exceeded their fair value accordingly upon the completion of the relevant impairment tests discussed above we recognized impairment charges of 1238 million   and 1743 million  for goodwill and trademark and trade names respectively during the quarter ended september 30 2015 these charges reflected the full carrying amounts of the goodwill and trademark and trade names leaving pullmantur with no intangible assets on its books 

in conjunction with performing the twostep goodwill impairment test for the pullmantur reporting unit we identified that the estimated fair value of certain longlived assets consisting of two ships and three aircraft was less than their carrying values as a result of this determination we evaluated these assets pursuant to our longlived asset impairment test resulting in an impairment charge of 1132 million to write down these assets to their estimated fair values during the quarter ended september 30 2015 

derivative instruments 

we enter into various forward swap and option contracts to manage our interest rate exposure and to limit our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices these instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value and the vast majority are designated as hedges we also use nonderivative financial instruments designated as hedges of our net investment in our foreign operations and investments although certain of our derivative financial instruments do not qualify or are not accounted for under hedge accounting we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes we account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with authoritative guidance refer to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  and note 14 fair value measurements and derivative instruments  to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for more information on related authoritative guidance the companys hedging programs and derivative financial instruments 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and collars interest rate crosscurrency and fuel swaps and options with thirdparty institutions in overthecounter markets we estimate the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate and crosscurrency swaps using expected future cash flows based on the instruments contract terms and published forward prices for foreign currency exchange and interest rates we apply present value techniques and libor or euriborbased discount rates to convert the expected future cash flows to the current fair value of the instruments 

we estimate the fair value of our foreign currency collars using standard option pricing models with inputs based on the options contract terms such as exercise price and maturity and readily available public market data such as foreign exchange prices foreign exchange volatility levels and discount rates 

we estimate the fair value of our fuel swaps using expected future cash flows based on the swaps contract terms and forward prices we derive forward prices from forward fuel curves based on pricing inputs provided by thirdparty institutions that transact in the fuel indices we hedge we validate these pricing inputs against actual market transactions and published price quotes for similar assets we apply present value techniques and liborbased discount rates to convert the expected future cash flows to the current fair value of the instruments we also corroborate our fair value estimates using valuations provided by our counterparties 

we adjust the valuation of our derivative financial instruments to incorporate credit risk 

we believe it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate crosscurrency and fuel swaps and options would be derived from other appropriate valuation models using similar assumptions inputs or conditions suggested by actual historical experience 

contingencies—litigation 

on an ongoing basis we assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions we use our best judgment 

to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss if any can be made in assessing probable losses we take into consideration estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries if any which are recorded as assets when recoverability is probable we accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recoveries it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made 

seasonality 

our revenues are seasonal based on demand for cruises demand is strongest for cruises during the northern hemispheres summer months and holidays in order to mitigate the impact of the winter weather in the northern hemisphere and to capitalize on the summer season in the southern hemisphere our brands have focused on deployment to the caribbean asia and australia during that period 

financial presentation 

description of certain line items 

revenues 

our revenues are comprised of the following 

 cruise operating expenses 

our cruise operating expenses are comprised of the following 



 we do not allocate payroll and related expenses food expenses fuel expenses or other operating expenses to the expense categories attributable to passenger ticket revenues or onboard and other revenues since they are incurred to provide the total cruise vacation experience 

selected operational and financial metrics 

we utilize a variety of operational and financial metrics which are defined below to evaluate our performance and financial condition as discussed in more detail herein certain of these metrics are nongaap financial measures these nongaap financial measures are provided along with the related gaap financial measures as we believe they provide useful information to investors as a supplement to our consolidated financial statements which are prepared and presented in accordance with gaap the presentation of nongaap financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap 

adjusted earnings per share adjusted eps  represents adjusted net income divided by weighted average shares outstanding or by diluted weighted average shares outstanding as applicable we believe that this nongaap measure is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis 

adjusted net income  represents net income excluding certain items that we believe adjusting for is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis for the periods presented these items included the impairment of the pullmantur related assets the net loss related to the elimination of the pullmantur reporting lag the net gain related to the 51 sale of the pullmantur and cdf croisières de france cdf brands restructuring charges and other initiative costs related to our pullmantur rightsizing strategy and other restructuring initiatives 

available passenger cruise days  apcd is our measurement of capacity and represents double occupancy per cabin multiplied by the number of cruise days for the period which excludes canceled cruise days and drydock days we use this measure to perform capacity and rate analysis to identify our main noncapacity drivers that cause our cruise revenue and expenses to vary 

doubledouble   program refers to the multiyear adjusted eps and return on invested capital roic goals we publicly announced in 2014 and sought to achieve by the end of 2017 we designed this program to help us better execute and achieve our business goals by clearly articulating longerterm financial objectives under the doubledouble program we targeted adjusted eps of 678 by the end of 2017 which was double our 2014 adjusted eps of 339 we also targeted roic of 10 by the end of 2017 as compared to roic of 59 in 2014 

gross cruise costs  represent the sum of total cruise operating expenses plus marketing selling and administrative expenses 

gross yields  represent total revenues per apcd 

net cruise costs  and net cruise costs excluding fuel  represent gross cruise costs excluding commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses and in the case of net cruise costs excluding fuel fuel expenses each of which is described above under the description of certain line items  heading in measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income we believe changes in net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance a reconciliation of historical gross cruise costs to net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel is provided below under results of operations  for the periods presented net cruise costs excludes the net gain related to the 51 sale of the pullmantur and cdf brands restructuring charges and other initiative costs related to our pullmantur rightsizing strategy and other restructuring initiatives  

net revenues represent total revenues less commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses each of which is described above under the description of certain line items  heading 

net yields  represent net revenues per apcd we utilize net revenues and net yields to manage our business on a daytoday basis as we believe that they are the most relevant measures of our pricing performance because they reflect the cruise revenues earned by us net of our most significant variable costs which are commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses a reconciliation of historical gross yields to net yields is provided below under results of operations  for the periods presented net yields excludes initiative costs related to the sale of the pullmantur and cdf brands 

occupancy  in accordance with cruise vacation industry practice is calculated by dividing passenger cruise days by apcd a percentage in excess of 100 indicates that three or more passengers occupied some cabins 

passenger cruise days  represent the number of passengers carried for the period multiplied by the number of days of their respective cruises 

we believe net yields net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel are our most relevant nongaap financial measures however a significant portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar because our reporting currency is the united states dollar the value of these revenues and expenses can be affected by changes in currency exchange rates although such changes in local currency prices are just one of many elements impacting our revenues and expenses they can be an important element for this reason we also monitor net yields net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel as if the current periods currency exchange rates had remained constant with the comparable prior periods rates or on a constant currency basis 

it should be emphasized that constant currency is primarily used for comparing shortterm changes andor projections changes in guest sourcing and shifting the amount of purchases between currencies can change the impact of the purely currencybased fluctuations 

the use of certain significant nongaap measures such as net yields net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel allows us to perform capacity and rate analysis to separate the impact of known capacity changes from other less predictable changes which affect our business we believe these nongaap measures provide expanded insight to measure revenue and cost performance in addition to the gaap based financial measures there are no specific rules or regulations for determining nongaap and constant currency measures and as such there exists the possibility that they may not be comparable to other companies within the industry we have not provided a quantitative reconciliation of i projected total revenues to projected net revenues ii projected gross yields to projected net yields iii projected gross cruise costs to projected net cruise costs and projected net cruise costs excluding fuel and iv projected net income and earnings per share to projected adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share because preparation of meaningful gaap projections of total revenues gross yields gross cruise costs net income and earnings per share would require unreasonable effort due to significant uncertainty we are unable to predict without unreasonable effort the future movement of foreign exchange rates fuel prices and interest rates inclusive of our related hedging programs in addition we are unable to determine the future impact of restructuring expenses or other noncore business related gains and losses which may result from strategic initiatives these items are uncertain and could be material to our results of operations in accordance with gaap due to this uncertainty we do not believe that reconciling information for such projected figures would be meaningful 

executive overview 

our 2017 net income was 16 billion or 753 per diluted share compared to 13 billion or 593 per diluted share in 2016 adjusted net income for 2017 was 16 billion or 753 per diluted share compared to 13 billion or 608 per diluted share in 2016 adjusted eps for 2017 represents the fourth straight year we achieved a record amount growing approximately 24 compared to 2016 

the year 2017 marked the final year of our doubledouble program doubledouble which was comprised of two multiyear financial targets including doubling our 2014 adjusted eps to 678 and achieving doubledigit roic by the end of 2017 the doubledouble program was successful in galvanizing our large workforce and drove a real step change in performance our longterm commitment to grow revenue yields manage costs and maintain steady capacity growth guided us towards the achievement of the doubledouble we finished 2017 with adjusted eps of 753 and roic in excess of 10 exceeding our doubledouble targets during the doubledouble period we have experienced annual adjusted eps growth of approximately 24 26 and 42 and annual roic growth of approximately 18 17 and 29 in each of 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively 

additionally net yields on a constantcurrency basis increased for the eighth consecutive year for the year ended december 31 2017 our net yields on a constantcurrency basis increased by 64 primarily driven by increases in both ticket and onboard yields and by a benefit from the deconsolidation of the pullmantur brand strong demand for europe and north america products combined with strong onboard trends are responsible for the growth partly offsetting these successes was the impact of the 2017 hurricane season and chinas south korea travel restrictions 

net onboard revenue yield in 2017 grew by 68 yearoveryear on a constant currency basis growth came from a variety of areas including beverage package sales specialty restaurants shore excursions and our high speed onboard internet products 

we remain dedicated to finding efficiencies identifying synergies and reducing costs while at the same time focusing on strategic investments in areas that will boost revenue in 2017 our net cruise costs excluding fuel increased by 20 on a constant currency basis compared to 2016 

the company remains focused on improving returns for our shareholders in 2017 we bought back 225 million shares of common stock under our 500 million share repurchase program that was announced in april 2017 we also announced a 25 increase to our common stock dividend our fifth consecutive year with a dividend increase in addition during 2017 both moody’s and sp upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to investment grade 

in 2018 all three of our global brands will each welcome a ship in the same year  a first in our history royal caribbean international will welcome newbuild symphony of the seas  in april azamara club cruises will welcome azamara pursuit in august and celebrity cruises will welcome its newbuild celebrity edge  in november in 2018 we expect our capacity in the caribbean will increase as symphony of the seas  and celebrity edge  join the caribbean in the winter celebrity infinity  returns to the caribbean and we upsize jewel of the seas  to freedom of the seas  and enchantment of the seas  to mariner of the seas  as a result of mariner of the seas  repositioning from asiapacific to north america to make way for spectrum of the seas’  arrival in early 2019 we expect our asiapacific capacity will decrease year over year and will account for 17 of our total capacity in 2018 we expect europe will represent 17 of our capacity in 2018 with growth driven by the symphony of the seas  inaugural western mediterranean season replacing freedom of the seas  and the addition of azamara pursuit 

in november 2017 we announced the order of celebrity flora  the brand’s first ship designed specifically for the galapagos islands which we expect will sail beginning in 2019 in addition to investing in new hardware and our existing hardware through our fleet modernization programs royal amplified  and celebrity revolution  we continue to opportunistically evaluate selling or transferring older ships to further optimize our fleet since 2014 we have sold four ships  the sale of celebrity century  to a subsidiary of skysea holdings the sale of ocean dream  to an unrelated thirdparty the sale of splendour of the seas  to tui cruises and sale of legend of the seas to an affiliate of tui ag our joint venture partner in tui cruises 

after announcing our achievement of doubledouble we thanked employees for their contribution with individual salary bonuses of five percent employees received equitybased awards equal to five percent of their 2017 salaries in an 80 million program called the  thank you thank you bonus  the awards which vest over three years went to all employees – shipboard and shoreside fulltime and parttime domestic and overseas corporate officers however were excluded in addition to the five percent equitybased awards we will contribute to the crew welfare fund for upgrades to crew living and recreational areas

the increase in passenger ticket revenues was partially offset by a 24  decrease in capacity which decreased passenger ticket revenues by   1485 million  primarily due to the sale of our majority interest in pullmantur holdings during the third quarter of 2016 the sale of splendour of the seas  in the second quarter of 2016 and the sale of legend of the seas  in first quarter of 2017 which was partially offset by an increase in capacity due to the addition of ovation of the seas and  harmony of the seas  into our fleet during the second quarter of 2016

other income expense 

interest expense net of interest capitalized  decreased 296 million or 107 to 3074 million in 2016 from 2777 million in 2015 the increase was due to a higher average debt level attributable to the financing of ovation of the seas  and harmony of the seas  partially offset by lower pricing on debt refinanced in 2015 

equity investment income  increased 473 million or 584 to 1284 million in 2016 from 810 million in 2015 mainly due to the increase in income from tui cruises one of our equity method investments

other comprehensive income loss 

other comprehensive income in 2016 was 4119 million   compared to a loss of   4314 million in 2015 the change of 8434 million was primarily due to the gain on cash flow derivative hedges  in 2016 of 4112 million compared to the loss on cash flow derivative hedges  of 4060 million in 2015 the gain in 2016 resulted mostly from the reclassification of losses to earnings during 2016 from fuel cash flow hedges in addition there was an increase in the fair value of our fuel swaps in 2016 as a result of higher forward fuel prices the loss in 2015 was primarily due to the decrease in the fair value of our fuel swaps and of our foreign currency forward contracts as a 

result of decreases in fuel prices and forward currency rates somewhat offset by the reclassification of losses to earnings during 2015 from fuel cash flow hedges

cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity net cash provided by operating activities increased 3579 million  to 29 billion  in 2017  compared to 25 billion  in 2016  the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to an increase in proceeds from customer deposits an increase in cash receipts from onboard spending and a decrease in fuel costs in 2017  compared to 2016  additionally dividends received from unconsolidated affiliates increased by 337 million  

net cash provided by operating activities increased 5703 million to 25 billion in 2016 compared to 19 billion in 2015 the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to an increase in proceeds from customer deposits an increase in cash receipts from onboard spending and a decrease in fuel costs in 2016 compared to 2015 additionally dividends received from unconsolidated affiliates increased by 426 million 

net cash used in investing activities decreased 25 billion  to 2136 million  in 2017  compared to 27 billion  in 2016  the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in capital expenditures of 19 billion  due to ship deliveries in 2016 ovation of the seas  and harmony of the seas  compared to no ship deliveries in 2017 in addition we received 2300 million  of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment in 2017 which did not occur in 2016 furthermore during 2017 we received cash of 632 million  on settlements on our foreign currency forward contracts compared to cash paid of 2132 million  during 2016 

net cash used in investing activities increased 9819 million to 27 billion in 2016 compared to 17 billion in 2015 the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in capital expenditures of 8810 million in 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to the deliveries of ovation of the seas  and harmony of the seas  in 2016 additionally cash repayments received on loans to our unconsolidated affiliates decreased 860 million in 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 mainly due to tui cruises repaying in 2015 the outstanding balance of the debt facility we originally provided to them in 2011 

net cash used in financing activities was 27 billion  in 2017  compared to net cash provided in financing activities of 2438 million  in 2016  the change was primarily attributable to a decrease in debt proceeds of 15 billion  an increase in debt repayments of 15 billion  and a higher amount of dividends paid during 2017 compared to 2016 partially offset by a decrease of stock repurchases of 750 million  during 2017 compared to 2016 the decrease in debt proceeds was primarily due to the 8418 million unsecured term loan borrowed in april 2016 to finance ovation of the sea s and the €7007 million and 2261 million unsecured term loans borrowed in may 2016 to finance harmony of the seas  that did not recur in 2017   and lower drawings on our revolving credit facilities during 2017 compared to 2016 partially offset by 800 million  in proceeds received from unsecured senior notes issued during 2017 which did not occur in 2016 the increase in repayment of debt was primarily due to higher payments on our revolving credit facilities 

net cash provided by financing activities was 2438 million in 2016 compared to net cash used in financing activities of 2535 million in 2015 the change was primarily attributable to an increase in debt proceeds of 29 billion during 2016 compared to 2015 partially offset by an increase in repayment of debt of 22 billion an increase in stock repurchases of 1000 million   and an increase in dividends paid of 663 million during 2016 compared to 2015 the increase in debt proceeds was primarily due to the 8418 million unsecured term loan borrowed in april 2016 to finance ovation of the sea s the €7007 million and 2261 million unsecured term loans borrowed in may 

2016 to finance harmony of the seas  the 2000 million unsecured term loan borrowed in april 2016 and higher drawings on our revolving credit facilities during 2016 compared to the 7421 million unsecured term loan borrowed in april 2015 to finance anthem of the seas  the increase in repayment of debt was primarily due to higher payments on our revolving credit facilities

contractual obligations 

as of december 31 2017  our contractual obligations were as follows in thousands 



 

1 we are obligated under noncancelable operating leases primarily for offices warehouses and motor vehicles amounts represent contractual obligations with initial terms in excess of one year 

2 longterm debt obligations mature at various dates through fiscal year 2028 and bear interest at fixed and variable rates interest on variablerate debt is calculated based on forecasted debt balances including the impact of interest rate swap agreements using the applicable rate at december 31 2017  debt denominated in other currencies is calculated based on the applicable exchange rate at december 31 2017  

3 amounts primarily represent future commitments with remaining terms in excess of one year to pay for our usage of certain port facilities marine consumables services and maintenance contracts amounts do not include the portmiami lease further discussed below under offbalance sheet arrangements  

4 amounts do not include potential obligations which remain subject to cancellation at our sole discretion 

5 amounts represent debt obligations with initial terms in excess of one year debt denominated in other currencies is calculated based on the applicable exchange rate at december 31 2017  

6 amounts represent capital lease obligations with initial terms in excess of one year 

7 amounts represent fees payable to sovereign guarantors in connection with certain of our export credit debt facilities and facility fees on our revolving credit facilities 

please refer to funding needs and sources  for discussion on the planned funding of the above contractual obligations 

as a normal part of our business depending on market conditions pricing and our overall growth strategy we continuously consider opportunities to enter into contracts for the building of additional ships we may also consider the sale of ships or the purchase of existing ships we continuously consider potential acquisitions and strategic alliances if any of these were to occur they would be financed through the incurrence of additional indebtedness the issuance of additional shares of equity securities or through cash flows from operations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we and tui ag have each guaranteed repayment of 50  of a bank loan provided to tui cruises which is due 2022 notwithstanding this the lenders have agreed to release each shareholder’s guarantee if certain conditions are met by april 2018 as of december 31 2017  €951 million  or approximately 1142 million  based on the exchange rate at december 31 2017  remains outstanding based on current facts and circumstances we do not believe potential obligations under this guarantee are probable 

tui cruises has entered into various ship construction and credit agreements that include certain restrictions on each of our and tui ags ability to reduce our current ownership interest in tui cruises below 3755  through 2021 

in july 2016 we executed an agreement with miami dade county “mdc” which was simultaneously assigned to sumitomo banking corporation “smbc” to lease land from mdc and construct a new cruise terminal at portmiami in miami florida the terminal is expected to be approximately 170000 square feet and will serve as a homeport during the construction period smbc will fund the costs of the terminal’s construction and land lease upon completion of the terminals construction we will operate and lease the terminal from smbc for a fiveyear term we determined that the lease arrangement between smbc and us should be accounted for as an operating lease upon completion of the terminal 

some of the contracts that we enter into include indemnification provisions that obligate us to make payments to the counterparty if certain events occur these contingencies generally relate to changes in taxes increased lender capital costs and other similar costs the indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms and are entered into in the normal course of business there are no stated or notional amounts included in the indemnification clauses and we are not able to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments if any under these indemnification clauses we have not been required to make any payments under such indemnification clauses in the past and under current circumstances we do not believe an indemnification obligation is probable 

as of december 31 2017  other than the items described above we are not party to any other offbalance sheet arrangements including guarantee contracts retained or contingent interest certain derivative instruments and variable interest entities that either have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial position 

funding needs and sources 

we have significant contractual obligations of which our debt service obligations and the capital expenditures associated with our ship purchases represent our largest funding needs as of december 31 2017  we had approximately 41 billion  in contractual obligations due through december 31 2018  of which approximately 12 billion  relates to debt maturities 03 billion  relates to interest on longterm debt and 24 billion  relates to ship purchase payments including the final installments payable due upon the deliveries of symphony of the seas  and celebrity edge  in the 

first and fourth quarters of 2018 respectively we have historically relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations drawdowns under our available credit facilities the incurrence of additional debt andor the refinancing of our existing debt and the issuance of additional shares of equity securities to fund these obligations 

we had a working capital deficit of 39 billion  and 37 billion  as of december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  respectively included within our working capital deficit is 12 billion  and 13 billion  of current portion of debt including capital leases as of december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  respectively similar to others in our industry we operate with a substantial working capital deficit this deficit is mainly attributable to the fact that under our business model a vast majority of our passenger ticket receipts are collected in advance of the applicable sailing date these advance passenger receipts remain a current liability until the sailing date the cash generated from these advance receipts is used interchangeably with cash on hand from other sources such as our revolving credit facilities and other cash from operations the cash received as advanced receipts can be used to fund operating expenses for the applicable future sailing or otherwise pay down our revolving credit facilities invest in long term investments or any other use of cash in addition we have a relatively lowlevel of accounts receivable and rapid turnover results in a limited investment in inventories we generate substantial cash flows from operations and our business model along with our unsecured revolving credit facilities has historically allowed us to maintain this working capital deficit and still meet our operating investing and financing needs we expect that we will continue to have working capital deficits in the future 

as of december 31 2017  we had liquidity of 22 billion  consisting of approximately 01 billion  in cash and cash equivalents and 21 billion  available under our unsecured revolving credit facilities we anticipate that our cash flows from operations and our current financing arrangements as described above will be adequate to meet our capital expenditures and debt repayments over the next twelvemonth period 

in april 2017 moodys changed our senior unsecured debt credit rating to baa3 with a stable outlook consistent with the provisions of our interest rate derivatives instruments all collateral that was posted with our counterparties as of that date was returned in april 2017 in addition the interest margins and guarantee premium payable under certain of our credit agreements were automatically reduced in accordance with their terms 

on april 28 2017 we announced that our board of directors authorized a twelvemonth common stock repurchase program for up to 500 million as of december 31 2017 we have 2750 million that remains available for future common stock repurchase transactions under this board approved program future repurchases may be made at managements discretion from time to time on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions repurchases under the program are expected to be funded from available cash or borrowings under our revolving credit facilities refer to note 8 shareholders equity to our consolidated financial statements for further information 

if any person acquires ownership of more than 50 of our common stock or subject to certain exceptions during any 24month period a majority of the board is no longer comprised of individuals who were members of the board on the first day of such period we may be obligated to prepay indebtedness outstanding under our credit facilities which we may be unable to replace on similar terms our public debt securities also contain change of control provisions that would be triggered by a thirdparty acquisition of greater than 50 of our common stock coupled with a ratings downgrade if this were to occur it would have an adverse impact on our liquidity and operations 

debt covenants 

certain of our financing agreements contain covenants that require us among other things to maintain minimum net worth of at least 80 billion  a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 125x and limit our net debttocapital ratio to no more than 625  the fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated by dividing net cash from operations for the past four quarters by the sum of dividend payments plus scheduled principal debt payments in excess of any new financings for the past four quarters our minimum net worth and maximum net debttocapital calculations exclude the impact of accumulated other comprehensive loss on total shareholders equity  we were well in excess of all debt covenant requirements as of december 31 2017  the specific covenants and related definitions can be found in the applicable debt agreements the majority of which have been previously filed with the securities and exchange commission 

dividends 

in december 2017  we declared a cash dividend on our common stock of 060  per share which was paid in the first quarter of 2018  we declared a cash dividend on our common stock of 060  per share during the third quarter of 2017  which was paid in the fourth quarter of 2017  during the first and second quarters of 2017  we declared a cash dividend on our common stock of 048  per share which was paid in the second and third quarters of 2017 respectively during the first quarter of 2017  we also paid a cash dividend on our common stock of 048  per share which was declared during the fourth quarter of 2016 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial instruments and other 

general 

we are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices we try to mitigate these risks through a combination of our normal operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments pursuant to our hedging practices and policies the financial impact of these hedging instruments is primarily offset by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures being hedged we achieve this by closely matching the amount term and conditions of the derivative instrument with the underlying risk being hedged although certain of our derivative financial instruments do not qualify or are not accounted for under hedge accounting our objective is not to hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes refer to note 14 fair value measurements   and derivative instruments to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our longterm debt obligations including future interest payments at december 31 2017  approximately 574  of our longterm debt was effectively fixed as compared to 405  as of december 31 2016  we use interest rate swap agreements to modify our exposure to interest rate movements and to manage our interest expense 

market risk associated with our longterm fixed rate debt is the potential increase in fair value resulting from a decrease in interest rates we use interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a portion of our fixedrate debt to a floatingrate basis to manage this risk at december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  we maintained interest rate swap agreements on the following fixedrate debt instruments 



these interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as fair value hedges 

the estimated fair value of our longterm fixedrate debt at december 31 2017  was 24 billion  using quoted market prices where available or using the present value of expected future cash flows which incorporates risk profile the fair value of our fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements was estimated to be a liability of 198 million  as of december 31 2017  based on the present value of expected future cash flows a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates at december 31 2017  would increase the fair value of our hedged and unhedged longterm fixedrate debt by approximately 1274 million  and would increase the fair value of our fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements by approximately 318 million  

market risk associated with our longterm floatingrate debt is the potential increase in interest expense from an increase in interest rates we use interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a portion of our floatingrate debt to a fixedrate basis to manage this risk a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase our forecasted 2018  interest expense by approximately 301 million  assuming no change in foreign currency exchange rates 

at december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  we maintained interest rate swap agreements on the following floatingrate debt instruments 



 

 

these interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges 

the fair value of our floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements was estimated to be a liability of 245 million  as of december 31 2017  based on the present value of expected future cash flows these interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to our ship construction contracts denominated in euros our foreign currency denominated debt and our international business operations we enter into foreign currency forward contracts collar options and crosscurrency swap agreements to manage portions of the exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 

the estimated fair value as of december 31 2017  of our eurodenominated forward contracts associated with our ship construction contracts was an asset of 2359 million  based on the present value of expected future cash flows as of december 31 2017  the aggregate cost of our ships on order not including the tui cruises ships on order was approximately 133 billion  of which we had deposited 4657 million  as of such date approximately 540  and 667  of the aggregate cost of the ships under construction was exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate at december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  respectively a hypothetical 10 strengthening of the euro as of december 31 2017  assuming no changes in comparative interest rates would result in a 7160 million  increase in the united states dollar cost of the foreign currency denominated ship construction contracts exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate the majority of our foreign currency forward contracts collar options and crosscurrency swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow fair value or net investment hedges depending on the designation of the related hedge 

our international business operations subject us to foreign currency exchange risk we transact business in many different foreign currencies and maintain investments in foreign operations which may expose us to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates movements in foreign currency exchange rates may affect the value of our earnings in foreign currencies and cash flows we manage most of this exposure on a consolidated basis which allows us to take advantage of any natural offsets therefore weakness in one particular currency might be offset by strengths in other currencies over time the extent to which one currency is effective as a natural offset of another currency fluctuates over time in addition some foreign currency exposures have little to no mitigating natural offsets available 

we consider our investments in our foreign operations to be denominated in relatively stable currencies and of a longterm nature as of december 31 2017  we maintained foreign currency forward contracts and designated them as hedges of a portion of our net investment in tui cruises of €1010 million  or approximately 1213 million  based on the exchange rate at december 31 2017  these forward currency contracts mature in october 2021 

we also address the exposure of our investments in foreign operations by denominating a portion of our debt in our subsidiaries and investments functional currencies and designating it as a hedge of these subsidiaries and investments we had designated debt as a hedge of our net investments in tui cruises of approximately €2460 million  or approximately 2953 million  through december 31 2017 as of december 31 2016 we had designated debt as a hedge of our net investments in tui cruises of approximately €2950 million  or approximately 3112 million  

we have included approximately 685 million  and 1140 million  of foreigncurrency transaction losses and of changes in the fair value of derivatives in the foreign currency translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive loss  at december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  respectively 

lastly on a regular basis we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and from time to time we utilize crosscurrency swap agreements to minimize the volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than our functional currency or the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries during 2017  we maintained an average of approximately 7394 million  of these foreign currency forward contracts these instruments are not designated as hedging instruments in 2017  2016  and 2015  changes in the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts resulted in a gain loss of approximately 620 million  511 million  and 555 million  respectively which offset losses gains arising from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies in those same years of 756 million  398 million  and 346 million  respectively these changes were recognized in earnings within other expense in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss 

fuel price risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates primarily to the consumption of fuel on our ships fuel cost net of the financial impact of fuel swap agreements as a percentage of our total revenues was approximately 78  in 2017  84  in 2016  and 96  in 2015  we use fuel swap agreements to mitigate the financial impact of fluctuations in fuel prices 

as of december 31 2017  we had fuel swap agreements to pay fixed prices for fuel with an aggregate notional amount of approximately 8285 million  maturing through 2021  the fuel swap agreements represented 50  of our projected 2018  fuel requirements 46  of our projected 2019  fuel requirements 36  of our projected 2020  fuel requirements and 14  of our projected 2021  fuel requirements these fuel swap agreements are generally accounted for as cash flow hedges the estimated fair value of these contracts at december 31 2017  was estimated to be an asset of 143 million  we estimate that a hypothetical 10  increase in our weightedaverage fuel price from that experienced during the year ended december 31 2017  would increase our forecasted 2018  fuel cost by approximately 380 million  net of the impact of fuel swap agreements

our cruise ticket prices include accommodations and a wide variety of activities and amenities including meals and entertainment prices vary depending on many factors including the destination cruise length stateroom category selected and the time of year the cruise takes place although we grant credit terms in select markets mainly outside of the united states our payment terms generally require an upfront deposit to confirm a reservation with the balance due prior to the sailing our cruises are generally available for sale at least one year in advance and often as much as two years in advance of sailing during the selling period of a cruise we continually monitor and adjust our cruise ticket prices for available guest staterooms based on demand with the objective of maximizing net yields in early 2015 in an effort to preserve the integrity of our cruise pricing we implemented a new policy against introducing incremental discounting on our ticket prices in certain markets within 30 days of the sailing date through 2016 we continue to follow this policy 

as we grow our business globally our sale arrangements with travel agents may vary for instance our sale arrangements in the mainland chinese market are primarily composed of travel agent charter and group sales with full payment due closein to sailing and to a lesser extent retail agency and direct sales 

we have developed and implemented enhancements to our reservations system that provide us and our travel partners with additional capabilities the enhancements also allow us to better understand and react to the current demand and pricing environment and implement a variety of promotions 

we offer air transportation to our guests through our air transportation program available in major cities around the world generally air tickets are sold to guests at prices close to cost which vary by gateway and destination 

passenger ticket revenues accounted for approximately 72  73  and 73  of total revenues in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

onboard activities and other revenues 

our cruise brands offer modern fleets with a wide array of onboard services amenities and activities which vary by brand and ship while many onboard activities are included in the base price of a cruise we realize additional revenues from among other things gaming the sale of alcoholic and other beverages internet and other telecommunication services gift shop items shore excursions photography spasalon and fitness services art auctions catalogue gifts for guests and a wide variety of specialty restaurants and dining options many of these services are available for prebooking on the internet prior to embarkation these activities are provided either directly by us or by independent concessionaires from which we receive a percentage of their revenues 

in conjunction with our cruise vacations we offer pre and postcruise hotel packages to our royal caribbean international celebrity cruises and azamara club cruises guests we also offer cruise vacation protection coverage to guests in a number of markets which provides guests with coverage for trip cancellation medical protection and 

baggage protection onboard and other revenues accounted for approximately 28  27  and 27  of total revenues in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

segment reporting 

we operate three whollyowned cruise brands royal caribbean international celebrity cruises and azamara club cruises in addition we have a 50 investment in a joint venture with tui ag which operates the german brand tui cruises a 49 interest in the spanish brand pullmantur and have a minority interest in the chinese brand skysea cruises we believe our brands possess the versatility to enter multiple cruise market segments within the cruise vacation industry although each of our brands has its own marketing style as well as ships and crews of various sizes the nature of the products sold and services delivered by our brands share a common base ie the sale and provision of cruise vacations our brands also have similar itineraries as well as similar cost and revenue components in addition our brands source passengers from similar markets around the world and operate in similar economic environments with a significant degree of commercial overlap as a result our brands have been aggregated as a single reportable segment based on the similarity of their economic characteristics types of consumers regulatory environment maintenance requirements supporting systems and processes as well as products and services provided our chairman and chief executive officer has been identified as the chief operating decisionmaker and all significant operating decisions including the allocation of resources are based upon the analyses of the company as one segment  for financial information see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

employees 

as of december 31 2016  our global brands employed over 66000  employees including 60000  shipboard employees as well as 6000  fulltime and 100  parttime employees in our shoreside operations as of december 31 2016  approximately 85  of our shipboard employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements 

insurance 

we maintain insurance on the hull and machinery of our ships with insured values generally equal to the net book value of each ship this coverage is maintained with financially sound insurance underwriters from the british scandinavian french united states and other reputable international insurance markets 

we maintain protection and indemnity liability insurance which provides coverage for liabilities costs and expenses for illness and injury to crew guest injury pollution and other thirdparty claims that arise out of or are the result of our cruise operations our vessels are insured through either the united kingdom mutual steam ship assurance association bermuda limited the steamship mutual underwriting association or gard as our protection and indemnity liability insurance is done on a mutual basis and we are subject to additional premium calls in amounts based on claim records of all members of the mutual protection and indemnity association we are also subject to additional premium calls based on investment shortfalls experienced by the insurer 

we maintain war risk insurance which covers damage due to acts of war including invasion insurrection terrorism rebellion piracy and hijacking on each ship through a norwegian war risk insurance organization this coverage includes coverage for physical damage to the ship which is not covered under the hull policies as a result of war exclusion clauses in such hull policies we also maintain protection and indemnity war risk coverage for risks that would be excluded by the rules of the indemnity insurance organizations subject to certain limitations consistent with most marine war risk policies under the terms of our war risk insurance coverage in the event of a change in risk underwriters can give seven days notice to us that the policy will be canceled and reinstated at higher premium rates 

  

insurance coverage for shoreside property and casualty exposures shipboard inventory offvessel liability directors and officers and other risks are maintained with insurance underwriters in the united states and the united kingdom 

we do not carry business interruption insurance for our ships based on our evaluation of the risks involved and protective measures already in place as compared to the cost of insurance 

all insurance coverage is subject to certain limitations exclusions and deductible levels in addition in certain circumstances we either selfinsure or coinsure a portion of these risks premiums charged by insurance carriers including carriers in the maritime insurance industry increase or decrease from time to time and tend to be cyclical in nature these cycles are impacted both by our own loss experience and by losses incurred in direct and reinsurance markets we historically have been able to obtain insurance coverage in amounts and at premiums we have deemed to be commercially acceptable no assurance can be given that affordable and secure insurance markets will be available to us in the future particularly for war risk insurance 

trademarks 

we own a number of registered trademarks related to the royal caribbean international celebrity cruises and azamara club cruises cruise brands the registered trademarks include the name “royal caribbean international” and its crown and anchor logo the name “celebrity cruises” and its “x” logo the name “azamara club cruises” and its globe with an “a” logo and the names of various cruise ships as well as loyalty program names and other marketing programs we believe our largest brands trademarks are widely recognized throughout the world and have considerable value the duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country however trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use andor their registrations are properly maintained 

regulation 

our ships are regulated by various international national state and local laws regulations and treaties in force in the jurisdictions in which they operate in addition our ships are registered in the bahamas malta or in the case of our ships operating in the galapagos islands ecuador each ship is subject to regulations issued by its country of registry including regulations issued pursuant to international treaties governing the safety of our ships guests and crew as well as environmental protection each country of registry conducts periodic inspections to verify compliance with these regulations as discussed more fully below ships operating out of united states ports are subject to inspection by the united states coast guard for compliance with international treaties and by the united states public health service for sanitary and health conditions our ships are also subject to similar inspections pursuant to the laws and regulations of various other countries our ships visit 

we believe that we are in material compliance with all the regulations applicable to our ships and that we have all licenses necessary to conduct our business health safety security environmental and financial responsibility issues are and we believe will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant government authorities in the united states and internationally from time to time various regulatory and legislative changes may be proposed that could impact our operations and subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 

safety and security regulations 

our ships are required to comply with international safety standards defined in the international convention for safety of life at sea “solas” which among other things establishes requirements for ship design structural features materials construction lifesaving equipment and safe management and operation of ships to ensure guest and crew safety the solas standards are revised from time to time and the most recent modifications were phased in through 2010 compliance with these modified standards did not have a material effect on our operating costs solas incorporates the international safety management code “ism code” which provides an international standard for the safe management and operation of ships and for pollution prevention the ism code is mandatory for all vessels including passenger vessel operators 

all of our operations and ships are regularly audited by various national authorities and maintain the required certificates of compliance with the ism code 

our ships are subject to various security requirements including the international ship and port facility security code “isps code” which is part of solas and the us maritime transportation security act of 2002 “mtsa” which applies to ships that operate in us ports in order to satisfy these security requirements we implement security measures conduct vessel security assessments and develop security plans the security plans for all of our ships have been submitted to and approved by the respective countries of registry for our ships in compliance with the isps code and the mtsa 

the cruise vessel security and safety act of 2010 which applies to passenger vessels which embark or include port stops within the united states requires the implementation of certain safety design features as well as the establishment of practices for the reporting of and dealing with allegations of crime the cruise industry supported this legislation and we believe that our internal standards are generally as strict or stricter than the law requires a few provisions of the law call for regulations which have not yet been finalized however based on proposed regulations issued by the us coast guard in january 2015 we do not expect any material costs due to implementing these regulations 

environmental regulations 

we are subject to various international and national laws and regulations relating to environmental protection under such laws and regulations we are generally prohibited from discharging materials other than food waste into the waterways we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations from time to time environmental and other regulators consider more stringent regulations which may affect our operations and increase our compliance costs we believe that the impact of ships on the global environment will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world and accordingly may subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future including the items described below 

our ships are subject to the international maritime organization’s ‘‘imo’’ regulations under the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships the ‘‘marpol regulations’’ and the international convention for the control and management of ships ballast water and sediments ballast water management convention which includes requirements designed to minimize pollution by oil sewage garbage air emissions and the transfer of nonnativenonindigenous species we have obtained the relevant international compliance certificates relating to oil sewage and air pollution prevention for all of our ships and have begun to obtain the compliance certificates pertaining to ballast water as they become applicable to our ships 

the marpol regulations impose global limitations on the sulfur content of fuel used by ships operating worldwide to 35 the marpol regulations also establish special emission control areas ‘‘ecas’’ with stringent limitations on sulfur emissions in these areas as of february 2016 there are four established ecas that restrict sulfur emissions the baltic sea the north seaenglish channel certain waters surrounding the north american coast and the waters surrounding puerto rico and the us virgin islands the “caribbean eca” 

since january 1 2015 ships operating in these sulfur ecas have been required to reduce their fuel sulfur content from 10 to 01 this reduction has not had a significant impact on our results of operations to date largely due to a number of mitigating steps we have taken over the last several years including equipping all of our new ships delivered during or after 2014 with advanced emissions purification aep systems covering all engines and actively developing and testing aep systems on our existing fleet 

we continue to implement our aep system strategy both for our ships on order and for our existing fleet as our new ships are delivered they will provide us with additional operational and deployment flexibility we currently have in place exemptions for 19 of our existing ships which apply while they are sailing in the north american and caribbean ecas these exemptions have delayed the requirement to comply with the additional sulfur content reduction pending our continued development and deployment of aep systems on these ships 

  in addition we believe that the learning from our existing endeavors as well as our further efforts with regards to this technology will allow us to complete an effective aep system retrofit strategy for our fleet as a result we believe the cost of complying with the 2015 eca sulfur emission requirement will not be significant to our results of operations 

by january 1 2020 the marpol regulations will require the worldwide limitations on sulfur content of fuel to be reduced from 35 to 05 as this regulation is implemented worldwide and if we have not been able to successfully execute our mitigation strategies including our aep system retrofit strategy our fuel costs could increase significantly 

all new ships that began construction after january 1 2016 will be required to meet more stringent nitrogen oxide emission limits when operating within the north american and us caribbean sea eca we have been in the process of evaluating a number of technological alternatives over the last several years to address these new requirements and believe that we will be able to comply with these limits without a significant impact to our operations or fuel costs 

effective july 1 2015 the european commission adopted legislation that will require cruise ship operators with ships visiting ports in the european union to monitor and report on the ship’s annual carbon dioxide emissions starting in 2018 while we do not expect compliance with this regulation to materially impact our costs or results of operations the adopting legislation presents the new monitoring and reporting requirements as the first step of a staged approach which could ultimately result in additional costs or charges associated with carbon dioxide emissions 

effective september 8 2017 the imo ballast water management convention will require ships that carry and discharge ballast water to meet specific discharge standards by installing ballast water treatment systems within the next five years we do not expect compliance with this regulation to have a material effect on our results of operations 

consumer financial responsibility regulations 

we are required to obtain certificates from the united states federal maritime commission relating to our ability to satisfy liability in cases of nonperformance of obligations to guests as well as casualty and personal injury as a condition to obtaining the required certificates we arrange through our insurers for the provision of surety for our shipoperating companies the required surety amount is currently 300 million  per operator and is subject to additional consumer price index based adjustments 

we are also required by the united kingdom norway finland and the baltics to establish our financial responsibility for any liability resulting from the nonperformance of our obligations to guests from these jurisdictions in the united kingdom we are currently required by the association of british travel agents to provide performance bonds totaling approximately £274 million  in addition in 2016  we were required by the civil aviation authority to provide performance bonds totaling approximately £101 million  the norwegian travel guarantee fund requires us to maintain performance bonds in varying amounts during the course of the year to cover our financial responsibility in norway finland and the baltics these amounts ranged from nok 3 million  to nok 33 million  during 2016  

certain other jurisdictions also require that we establish financial responsibility to our guests resulting from the nonperformance of our obligations however the related amounts do not have a material effect on our costs 

regulations regarding protection of disabled persons 

in june 2013 the us architectural and transportation barriers compliance board proposed guidelines for the construction and alteration of passenger vessels to ensure that the vessels are readily accessible to and usable by passengers with disabilities once finalized these guidelines will be used by the us department of transportation and us department of justice to implement mandatory and enforceable standards for passenger vessels covered by the americans with disabilities act while we believe our vessels have been designed and outfitted to meet the needs of our guests with disabilities we cannot at this time accurately predict whether we will be required to make material modifications or incur significant additional expenses given the preliminary status of the proposed guidelines 

taxation of the company 

the following is a summary of our principal taxes exemptions and special regimes in addition to or instead of income taxation virtually all jurisdictions where our ships call impose some tax or fee or both based on guest headcount tonnage or some other measure 

our consolidated operations are primarily foreign corporations engaged in the owning and operating of passenger cruise ships in international transportation 

us income taxation 

the following is a discussion of the application of the us federal and state income tax laws to us and is based on the current provisions of the us internal revenue code treasury department regulations administrative rulings court decisions and the relevant state tax laws regulations rulings and court decisions of the states where we have business operations all of the foregoing is subject to change and any such change could affect the accuracy of this discussion 

application of section 883 of the internal revenue code 

we and celebrity cruises inc are engaged in a trade or business in the united states and many of our shipowning subsidiaries depending upon the itineraries of their ships receive income from sources within the united states additionally our united kingdom tonnage tax company is a shipoperating company classified as a disregarded entity for us federal income tax purposes that may earn us source income under section 883 of the internal revenue code certain foreign corporations may exclude from gross income and effectively from branch profits tax as such earnings do not give rise to effectively connected earnings and profits us source income derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships including income from the leasing of such ships 

a foreign corporation will qualify for the benefits of section 883 if in relevant part 1 the foreign country in which the foreign corporation is organized grants an equivalent exemption to corporations organized in the united states and 2 the stock of the corporation or the direct or indirect corporate parent thereof is “primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market” in the united states in the opinion of our us tax counsel drinker biddle  reath llp based on the representations and assumptions set forth in that opinion we celebrity cruises inc and our shipowning subsidiaries with us source shipping income qualify for the benefits of section 883 because we and each of those subsidiaries are incorporated in liberia which is a qualifying country and our common stock is primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market in the united states ie we are a publicly traded corporation if in the future 1 liberia no longer qualifies as an equivalent exemption jurisdiction and we do not reincorporate in a jurisdiction that does qualify for the exemption or 2 we fail to qualify as a publicly traded corporation we and all of our shipowning or operating subsidiaries that rely on section 883 to exclude qualifying income from gross income would be subject to us federal income tax on their us source shipping income and income from activities incidental thereto 

we believe that most of our income and the income of our shipowning subsidiaries including our uk tonnage tax company which is considered a division for us tax purposes is derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships and therefore is exempt from taxation under section 883 

regulations under section 883 list activities that are not considered by the internal revenue service to be incidental to the international operation of ships including the sale of air and land transportation shore excursions and pre and postcruise tours our income from these activities that is earned from sources within the united states will be subject to us taxation 

taxation in the absence of an exemption under section 883 

if we the operator of our vessels celebrity cruises inc or our shipowning subsidiaries were to fail to meet 

the requirements of section 883 of the internal revenue code or if the provision was repealed then as explained below such companies would be subject to us income taxation on a portion of their income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships 

because we and celebrity cruises inc conduct a trade or business in the united states we and celebrity cruises inc would be taxable at regular corporate rates on our separate company taxable income ie without regard to the income of our shipowning subsidiaries on income which is effectively connected with our us trade or business generally only income from us sources in addition if any of our earnings and profits effectively connected with our us trade or business were withdrawn or were deemed to have been withdrawn from our us trade or business those withdrawn amounts would be subject to a “branch profits” tax at the rate of 30 we and celebrity cruises inc would also be potentially subject to tax on portions of certain interest paid by us at rates of up to 30 

if section 883 were not available to our shipowning subsidiaries each such subsidiary would be subject to a special 4 tax on its us source gross transportation income if any each year because it does not have a fixed place of business in the united states and its income is derived from the leasing of a ship 

other united states taxation 

we and celebrity cruises inc earn us source income from activities not considered incidental to international shipping the tax on such income is not material to our results of operation for all years presented 

state taxation 

we celebrity cruises inc and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various us state income taxes which are generally imposed on each state’s portion of the us source income subject to federal income taxes additionally the state of alaska subjects an allocated portion of the total income of companies doing business in alaska and certain other affiliated companies to alaska corporate state income taxes and also imposes a 33 tax on adjusted gross income from onboard gambling activities conducted in alaska waters this did not have a material impact to our results of operations for all years presented 

maltese and spanish income taxation 

effective july 31 2016 we sold 51 of our interest in pullmantur holdings we account for our retained investment under the equity method of accounting there was no tax impact to us as a result of this sale transaction the surviving pullmantur company continues to be subject to the tax laws of spain and malta 

under the sale agreement we remain responsible for presale tax matters with respect to years that are still open under the statute of limitations 

united kingdom income taxation 

we operate fourteen ships under companies which have elected to be subject to the united kingdom tonnage tax regime “uk tonnage tax” 

companies subject to uk tonnage tax pay a corporate tax on a notional profit determined with reference to the net tonnage of qualifying vessels the requirements for a company to qualify for the uk tonnage tax regime include being subject to uk corporate income tax operating qualifying ships which are strategically and commercially managed in the united kingdom and fulfilling a seafarer training requirement 

failure to meet any of these requirements could cause us to lose the benefit of the tonnage tax regime which could have a material effect on our results of operations 

relevant shipping profits include income from the operation of qualifying ships and from shipping related activities our uk income from nonshipping activities which do not qualify under the uk tonnage tax regime and 

which are not considered significant remain subject to uk corporate income tax 

brazilian income taxation 

previously pullmantur and our uk tonnage tax company chartered certain ships to brazilian subsidiary companies for operations in brazil both pullmantur and royal caribbean international ceased charters to brazil in january 2016 and march 2016 respectively while brazilian charters took place the brazilian subsidiaries earnings were subject to brazilian taxation which was not considered significant the charter payments made to the uk tonnage tax company and to pullmantur were exempt from brazilian income tax under brazilian domestic law additionally remittances of revenue from sales of certain cruises in the brazilian market are subject to taxation 

chinese taxation 

our uk tonnage tax company operates ships in international transportation in china the income earned from this operation is exempt from taxation in china under the ukchina double tax treaty and other circulars addressing indirect taxes changes to or failure to qualify for the treaty or circular could cause us to lose the benefits provided which would have a material impact on our results of operations our chinese income from nonshipping activities or from shipping activities not qualifying for treaty or circular protection and which are considered insignificant remain subject to chinese taxation 

other taxation 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to valueadded and other indirect taxes most of which are reclaimable zerorated or exempt changes in the application or interpretation of applicable indirect tax laws or changes in tax legislation could have a material impact on our results of operations

 item 1a risk factors 

the risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k are important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historical results it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks there may be additional risks that we consider not to be material or which are not known and any of these risks could have the effects set forth below   the ordering of the risk factors set forth below is not intended to reflect any company indication of priority or likelihood see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a cautionary note regarding forwardlooking statements 

adverse worldwide economic or other conditions could reduce the demand for cruises and passenger spending adversely impacting our operating results cash flows and financial condition including potentially impairing the value of our ships and other assets 

the demand for cruises is affected by international national and local economic conditions weak or uncertain economic conditions impact consumer confidence and pose a risk as vacationers may postpone or reduce discretionary spending this in turn may result in cruise booking slowdowns decreased cruise prices and lower onboard revenues given the global nature of our business we are exposed to many different economies and our business could be hurt by challenging conditions in any of our markets any significant deterioration of global national or local economic conditions could result in a prolonged period of booking slowdowns depressed cruise prices and reduced onboard revenues 

fears of terrorist attacks war and other hostilities could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

events such as terrorist attacks war or warlike conditions conflicts domestic or crossborder civil unrest and other hostilities including an escalation in the frequency or severity of incidents and the resulting political instability travel restrictions and advisories and concerns over safety and security aspects of traveling or the fear of any of the foregoing have had and could have in the future a significant adverse impact on demand and pricing in the travel and vacation industry for example the series of terrorism incidents throughout europe in early 2016 negatively impacted demand for european cruises in 2016 particularly as it relates to demand for these cruises from north american guests in view of our global operations we are susceptible to a wide range of adverse events 

our operating costs could increase due to market forces and economic or geopolitical factors beyond our control 

our operating costs including fuel food payroll and benefits airfare taxes insurance and security costs are all subject to increases due to market forces and economic or political conditions or other factors beyond our control increases in these operating costs could adversely affect our profitability 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates fuel prices and interest rates could affect our financial results 

we are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates fuel prices and interest rates significant changes in any of the foregoing could have a material impact on our financial results net of the impact of our hedging activities and natural offsets our operating results have been and will continue to be impacted often significantly by changes in each of these factors the value of our earnings in foreign currencies is adversely impacted by a strong united states dollar in addition any significant increase in fuel prices could materially adversely affect our business as fuel prices not only impact our fuel costs but also some of our other expenses such as crew travel freight and commodity prices also while interest rates have been near historic lows for several years prevailing rates started to increase at the end of 2015 and are expected to continue to rise in 2017 which given our level of variable rate indebtedness would adversely impact our operating results see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” and “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ” for more information 

conducting business globally may result in increased costs and other risks 

we operate our business globally operating internationally exposes us to a number of risks including increased exposure to a wider range of regional and local economic conditions volatile local political conditions potential changes in duties and taxes including changing andor uncertain interpretations of existing tax laws and regulations required compliance with additional laws and policies affecting cruising vacation or maritime businesses or governing the operations of foreignbased companies currency fluctuations interest rate movements difficulties in operating under local business environments port quality and availability in certain regions us and global antibribery laws or regulations imposition of trade barriers and restrictions on repatriation of earnings 

our future growth strategies increasingly depend on the growth and sustained profitability of certain international markets such as china some factors that will be critical to our success in developing these markets may be different than those affecting our moreestablished north american and european markets in the chinese market in particular our future success depends on our ability to continue to raise awareness of our products evolve the available distribution channels and adapt our offerings to best suit the chinese consumer china’s economy differs from the economies of other developed countries in many respects and as the legal and regulatory system in china continues to evolve there may be greater uncertainty as to the interpretation and enforcement of applicable laws and regulations 

operating globally also exposes us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal regulatory and tax requirements in many parts of the world including countries in which we operate practices in the local business communities might not conform to international business standards we must adhere to policies designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance as well as applicable laws and regulations however we might not be successful in ensuring that our employees agents representatives and other third parties with whom we associate throughout the world properly adhere to them failure by us our employees or any of these third parties to adhere to our policies or applicable laws or regulations could result in penalties sanctions damage to our reputation and related costs which in turn could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows 

we have operations in and source passengers from the united kingdom and other member countries of the european union on june 23 2016 voters in the united kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the european union the proposed withdrawal has resulted in increased volatility in the global financial markets and in particular in global currency exchange rates the proposed withdrawal could potentially adversely affect tax legal and regulatory regimes to which our business in the region is subject the withdrawal could also among other potential outcomes disrupt the free movement of goods services and people between the united kingdom and the european union further uncertainty around these issues could lead to adverse effects on the economy of the united kingdom and the other economies in which we operate making it more difficult to source passengers from these regions these risks may be exacerbated if voters of other countries within the european union similarly elect to exit the european union in future referendums 

as a global operator our business may be impacted by changes in us policy in areas such as trade immigration andor environmental or labor regulations among others depending on the nature and scope of these changes they could impact our domestic and international business operations while still unclear these changes and any international response to them could potentially introduce new barriers to passenger travel andor cross border transactions 

if we are unable to address these risks adequately our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected including potentially impairing the value of our ships and other assets 

price increases for commercial airline service for our guests or major changes or reduction in commercial airline service andor availability could adversely impact the demand for cruises and undermine our ability to provide reasonably priced vacation packages to our guests 

many of our guests depend on scheduled commercial airline services to transport them to or from the ports where our cruises embark or disembark increases in the price of airfare would increase the overall price of the cruise vacation to our guests which may adversely impact demand for our cruises in addition changes in the availability of commercial airline services could adversely affect our guests’ ability to obtain airfare as well as our ability to fly our guests to or from our cruise ships which could adversely affect our results of operations 

incidents or adverse publicity concerning our ships andor passengers or the cruise vacation industry in general unusual weather conditions and other natural disasters or disruptions could affect our reputation as well as impact our sales and results of operations 

the ownership andor operation of cruise ships airplanes private destinations port facilities and shore excursions involves the risk of accidents illnesses mechanical failures environmental incidents and other incidents which may bring into question safety health security and vacation satisfaction which could negatively impact our reputation incidents involving cruise ships and in particular the safety health and security of guests and crew and media coverage thereof have impacted and could in the future impact demand for our cruises and pricing in the industry our reputation and our business could also be damaged by negative publicity regarding the cruise industry in general including publicity regarding the spread of contagious disease and the potentially adverse environmental impacts of cruising the considerable expansion in the use of social media and digital marketing over recent years has compounded the potential scope of any negative publicity if any such incident or news cycle occurs during a time of high seasonal demand the effect could disproportionately impact our results of operations for the year in addition incidents involving cruise ships may result in additional costs to our business increasing government or other regulatory oversight and in the case of incidents involving our ships potential litigation 

our cruise ships and port facilities may also be adversely impacted by unusual weather patterns or natural disasters or disruptions such as hurricanes we are often forced to alter itineraries and occasionally to cancel a cruise or a series of cruises due to these or other factors which could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability increases in the frequency severity or duration of severe weather events including those related to climate change could exacerbate the impact and cause further disruption to our operations in addition these and any other events which impact the travel industry more generally may negatively impact our ability to deliver guests or crew to our cruises andor interrupt our ability to obtain services and goods from key vendors in our supply chain any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and on industry performance 

an increase in capacity worldwide or excess capacity in a particular market could adversely impact our cruise sales andor pricing 

although our ships can be redeployed cruise sales andor pricing may be impacted by the introduction of new ships into the marketplace reductions in cruise capacity overall market growth and deployment decisions of ourselves and our competitors a total of 60  new ships with approximately 173000  berths are on order for delivery through 2021  in the cruise industry the further net growth in capacity from these new ships and future orders without an increase in the cruise industry’s demand andor share of the vacation market could depress cruise prices and impede our ability to achieve yield improvement 

in addition to the extent that we or our competitors deploy ships to a particular itinerary and the resulting capacity in that region exceeds the demand we may lower pricing and profitability may be lower than anticipated this risk may be amplified in emerging cruise markets such as china where we expect continuing increases in capacity over a relatively short time horizon any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition including potentially impairing the value of our ships and other assets 

unavailability of ports of call may adversely affect our results of operations  

we believe that port destinations are a major reason why guests choose to go on a particular cruise or on a cruise vacation the availability of ports is affected by a number of factors including existing capacity constraints constraints related to the size of certain ships security environmental and health concerns adverse weather conditions and natural disasters financial limitations on port development exclusivity arrangements that ports may have with our competitors local governmental regulations and local community concerns about port development and other adverse impacts on their communities from additional tourists in addition fuel costs may adversely impact the destinations on certain of our itineraries any limitations on the availability or feasibility of our ports of call or on the availability of shore excursions and other service providers at such ports could adversely affect our results of operations 

our reliance on shipyards and their subcontractors to implement our newbuild and ship upgrade programs and to repair and maintain our ships exposes us to risks which if realized could adversely impact our business 

we rely on shipyards and their subcontractors to effectively construct our new ships and to repair maintain and upgrade our existing ships on a timely basis and in a cost effective manner 

there are a limited number of shipyards with the capability and capacity to build our new ships and accordingly increased demand for available new construction slots andor continued consolidation in the cruise shipyard industry including completion of italian shipbuilder fincantieris bid for stx france could impact our ability to construct new ships when and as planned cause us to continue to commit to new ship orders earlier than we have historically done so andor result in stronger bargaining power on the part of the shipyards and the export credit agencies providing financing for the project our inability to timely and costeffectively procure new capacity could have a significant negative impact on our future business plans and results of operations 

building repairing maintaining andor upgrading a ship is sophisticated work that involves significant risks and shipyards andor their subcontractors may encounter financial technical or design problems when doing these jobs if materialized these problems could impact the timely delivery or costs of new ships or the ability of shipyards to repair and upgrade our fleet in accordance with our needs or expectations in addition delays or mechanical faults may result in cancellation of cruises or in more severe situations new ship orders or necessitate unscheduled drydocks and repairs of ships these events and any related adverse publicity could result in lost revenue increased operating expenses or both and thus adversely affect our results of operations 

we may lose business to competitors throughout the vacation market  

we operate in the vacation market and cruising is one of many alternatives for people choosing a vacation we therefore risk losing business not only to other cruise lines but also to other vacation operators which provide other leisure options including hotels resorts internetbased alternative lodging sites and package holidays and tours 

we face significant competition from other cruise lines on the basis of cruise pricing travel agent preference and also in terms of the nature of ships and services we offer to guests our principal competitors within the cruise vacation industry include carnival corporation  plc which owns among others aida cruises carnival cruise line costa cruises cunard line holland america line po cruises and princess cruises disney cruise line msc cruises and norwegian cruise line holdings ltd which owns norwegian cruise line oceania cruises and regent seven seas cruises our revenues are sensitive to the actions of other cruise lines in many areas including pricing scheduling capacity and promotions which can have a substantial adverse impact not only on our revenues but on overall industry revenues 

in the event that we do not effectively market or differentiate our cruise brands from our competitors or otherwise compete effectively with other vacation alternatives and new or existing cruise companies our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

we may not be able to obtain sufficient financing or capital for our needs or may not be able to do so on terms that are acceptable or consistent with our expectations 

to fund our capital expenditures including new ship orders operations and scheduled debt payments we have historically relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations drawdowns under available credit facilities the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the sale of equity or debt securities in private or public securities markets any circumstance or event which leads to a decrease in consumer cruise spending such as worsening global economic conditions or significant incidents impacting the cruise industry could negatively affect our operating cash flows see “ adverse worldwide economic geopolitical or other conditions… ” and “ incidents or adverse publicity concerning our ships andor passengers or the cruise vacation industry …” for more information 

although we believe we can access sufficient liquidity to fund our operations investments and obligations as expected there can be no assurances to that effect our ability to access additional funding as and when needed our 

ability to timely refinance andor replace our outstanding debt securities and credit facilities on acceptable terms and our cost of funding will depend upon numerous factors including but not limited to the vibrancy of the financial markets our financial performance the performance of our industry in general and the size scope and timing of our financial needs in addition even where financing commitments have been secured significant disruptions in the capital and credit markets could cause our banking and other counterparties to breach their contractual obligations to us this could include failures of banks or other financial service companies to fund required borrowings under our loan agreements or to pay us amounts that may become due or return collateral that is refundable under our derivative contracts for hedging of fuel prices interest rates and foreign currencies or other agreements if any of the foregoing occurs it may have a negative impact on our cash flows including our ability to meet our obligations our results of operations and our financial condition 

our liquidity could be adversely impacted if we are unable to satisfy the covenants required by our credit facilities or if we are required to post a significant amount of collateral under our interest rate hedging contracts 

our debt agreements contain covenants including covenants restricting our ability to take certain actions and financial covenants in addition our ability to make borrowings under our available credit facilities is subject to the absence of material adverse changes in our business our ability to maintain our credit facilities may also be impacted by changes in our ownership base more specifically we may be required to prepay our ship financing facilities if any person acquires ownership of more than 50 of our common stock or subject to certain exceptions during any 24month period a majority of the board is no longer comprised of individuals who were members of the board on the first day of such period our public debt securities also contain change of control provisions that would be triggered by a thirdparty acquisition of greater than 50 of our common stock coupled with a ratings downgrade 

our failure to comply with the terms of our debt facilities could result in an event of default generally if an event of default under any debt agreement occurs then pursuant to cross default acceleration clauses our outstanding debt and derivative contract payables could become due andor terminated in addition in such events our credit card processors could hold back payments to create a reserve we cannot provide assurances that we would have sufficient liquidity to repay or the ability to refinance the debt if such amounts were accelerated upon an event of default 

if we are unable to appropriately balance our cost management and capital allocation strategies with our goal of satisfying guest expectations it may adversely impact our business success 

our goals call for us to provide high quality products and deliver high quality services there can be no assurance that we can successfully balance these goals with our cost management and capital allocation strategies our business also requires us to make capital allocation decisions such as ordering new ships andor upgrading our ships based on expected market preferences and projected demand there can be no assurance that our strategies will be successful which could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

our attempts to expand our business into new markets and new ventures may not be successful 

we opportunistically seek to grow our business through among other things expansion into new destination or source markets and establishment of new ventures complementary to our current offerings these attempts to expand our business increase the complexity of our business require significant levels of investment and can strain our management personnel operations and systems there can be no assurance that these business expansion efforts will develop as anticipated or that we will succeed and if we do not we may be unable to recover our investment which could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

our reliance on travel agencies to sell and market our cruises exposes us to certain risks which if realized could adversely impact our business 

we rely on travel agencies to generate the majority of bookings for our ships accordingly we must ensure that our commission rates and incentive structures remain competitive if we fail to offer competitive compensation packages these agencies may be incentivized to sell cruises offered by our competitors to our detriment which could adversely impact our operating results our reliance on thirdparty sellers is particularly pronounced in certain markets 

such as china where we have a large number of travel agent charter and group sales and less retail agency and direct booking in addition the travel agent industry is sensitive to economic conditions that impact discretionary income significant disruptions especially disruptions impacting those agencies that sell a high volume of our business or contractions in the industry could reduce the number of travel agencies available for us to market and sell our cruises which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

disruptions in our shoreside operations or our information systems may adversely affect our results of operations 

our principal executive office and principal shoreside operations are located in florida and we have shoreside offices throughout the world actual or threatened natural disasters eg hurricanestyphoons earthquakes tornadoes fires or floods or similar events in these locations may have a material impact on our business continuity reputation and results of operations in addition substantial or repeated information systems failures computer viruses or cyberattacks impacting our shoreside or shipboard operations could adversely impact our business we do not generally carry business interruption insurance for our shoreside operations or our information systems as such any losses or damages incurred by us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

the loss of key personnel our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel or disruptions among our shipboard personnel due to strained employee relations could adversely affect our results of operations 

our success depends in large part on the skills and contributions of key executives and other employees and on our ability to recruit and retain high quality personnel in key markets we must continue to sufficiently recruit retain train and motivate our employees to maintain our current business and support our projected global growth both shoreside and on our ships furthermore as of december 31 2016 85  of our shipboard employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements a dispute under our collective bargaining agreements could result in a work stoppage of those employees covered by the agreements we may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate these collective bargaining agreements when they expire in addition existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage on our ships we may also be subject to or affected by work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements any such work stoppages or potential work stoppages could have a material adverse effect on our financial results as could a loss of key employees our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel or disruptions among our personnel 

business activities that involve our coinvestment with third parties may subject us to additional risks 

partnerships joint ventures and other business structures involving our coinvestment with third parties generally include some form of shared control over the operations of the business and create additional risks including the possibility that other investors in such ventures could become bankrupt or otherwise lack the financial resources to meet their obligations or could have or develop business interests policies or objectives that are inconsistent with ours with the sale of 51 of our interest in pullmantur in july 2016 we continue to expand the breadth of our coinvestment activities which also include tui cruises skysea cruises grand bahama shipyard and minority ownership investments in various port development and other projects in addition to financial risks our coinvestment activities may also present managerial and operational risks and expose us to reputational or legal concerns these or other issues related to our coinvestment with third parties could adversely impact our operations 

we rely on supply chain vendors and thirdparty service providers who are integral to the operations of our businesses these vendors and service providers may be unable or unwilling to deliver on their commitments or may act in ways that could harm our business 

we rely on supply chain vendors to deliver key products to the operations of our businesses around the world any event impacting a vendor’s ability to deliver goods of the required quality at the location and time needed could negatively impact our ability to deliver our cruise experience events impacting our supply chain could be caused by factors beyond the control of our suppliers or us including inclement weather natural disasters increased demand problems in production or distribution andor disruptions in third party logistics or transportation systems interruptions to our supply chain could increase costs and could limit the availability of products critical to our operations 

in order to achieve cost and operational efficiencies we outsource to thirdparty vendors certain services that are integral to the operations of our global businesses such as our onboard concessionaires certain of our call center operations and operation of a large part of our information technology systems we are subject to the risk that certain decisions are subject to the control of our thirdparty service providers and that these decisions may adversely affect our activities a failure to adequately monitor a thirdparty service provider’s compliance with a service level agreement or regulatory or legal requirements could result in significant economic and reputational harm to us there is also a risk the confidentiality privacy andor security of data held by third parties or communicated over thirdparty networks or platforms could become compromised 

a failure to keep pace with developments in technology or technological obsolescence could impair our operations or competitive position 

our business continues to demand the use of sophisticated technology and systems these technologies and systems must be refined updated andor replaced with more advanced systems in order to continue to meet our customers’ demands and expectations if we are unable to do so in a timely manner or within reasonable cost parameters or if we are unable to appropriately and timely train our employees to operate any of these new systems our business could suffer we also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new technology or system and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could impair our operating results 

we may be exposed to risks and costs associated with cyber security including protecting the integrity and security of our guests’ employees’ and business partners’ personal information 

we are subject to various risks associated with the collection handling storage and transmission of sensitive information including risks related to compliance with applicable laws and other contractual obligations as well as the risk that our systems collecting such information could be compromised in the course of doing business we collect large volumes of internal and customer data including personally identifiable information for various business purposes we are subject to federal state and international laws relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of personally identifiable information in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between the company and its subsidiaries and among the company its subsidiaries and other parties with which the company has commercial relations several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices if we fail to comply with the various applicable data collection and privacy laws we could be exposed to fines penalties restrictions litigation or other expenses and our business could be adversely impacted 

in addition even if we are fully compliant with legal standards and contractual requirements we still may not be able to prevent security breaches involving sensitive data any breach theft loss or fraudulent use of guest employee or company data could adversely impact our reputation and brand and our ability to retain or attract new customers and expose us to risks of data loss business disruption governmental investigation litigation and other liability any of which could adversely affect our business significant capital investments and other expenditures could be required to remedy the problem and prevent future breaches including costs associated with additional security technologies personnel experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached further if we or our vendors experience significant data security breaches or fail to detect and appropriately respond to significant data security breaches we could be exposed to government enforcement actions and private litigation additionally the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyberattacks and breaches of information technology systems as well as the sources and targets of these attacks change frequently and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time our security measures cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing or identifying such breaches 

the potential unavailability of insurance coverage or an inability to obtain insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

we seek to maintain appropriate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates we normally insure based on the cost of an asset rather than replacement value and we also elect to selfinsure coinsure or use deductibles in certain circumstances for certain risks such as loss of use of a ship or a cybersecurity breach the limits of insurance coverage we purchase are based on the availability of the coverage evaluation of our risk profile and cost of coverage accordingly we are not protected against all risks which could result in an unexpected decrease in our revenue and results of operations in the event of an incident 

our protection and indemnity “pi” liability insurance is placed on a mutual basis and we are subject to additional premium calls in amounts based on claim records of all members of the pi club we are also subject to additional premium assessments including but not limited to investment or underwriting shortfalls experienced by the pi club 

we cannot be certain that insurance and reinsurance coverage will be available to us and at commercially reasonable rates in the future additionally if we or other insureds sustain significant losses the result may be higher insurance premiums cancellation of coverage or the inability to obtain coverage such events could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

environmental labor health and safety financial responsibility and other maritime regulations could affect operations and increase operating costs 

the united states and various state and foreign government or regulatory agencies have enacted or may enact environmental regulations or policies such as requiring the use of low sulfur fuels that could increase our direct cost to operate in certain markets increase our cost for fuel limit the supply of compliant fuel cause us to incur significant expenses to purchase andor develop new equipment and adversely impact the cruise vacation industry while we have taken and expect to continue to take a number of actions to mitigate the potential impact of certain of these regulations there can be no assurances that these efforts will be successful or completed on a timely basis 

there is increasing global regulatory focus on climate change and greenhouse gas ghg emissions these regulatory efforts both internationally and in the united states are still developing and we cannot yet determine what the final regulatory programs or their impact will be in any jurisdiction where we do business however such climate changerelated regulatory activity in the future may adversely affect our business and financial results by requiring us to reduce our emissions purchase allowances or otherwise pay for our emissions such activity may also impact us by increasing our operating costs including fuel costs 

some environmental groups have also lobbied for more stringent regulation of cruise ships and have generated negative publicity about the cruise vacation industry and its environmental impact see item 1 businessregulationenvironmental regulations  

in addition we are subject to various international national state and local laws regulations and treaties that govern among other things discharge from our ships safety standards applicable to our ships treatment of disabled persons health and sanitary standards applicable to our guests security standards on board our ships and at the shipport interface areas and financial responsibilities to our guests these issues are and we believe will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world this could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise ships that could subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 

a change in our tax status under the united states internal revenue code or other jurisdictions may have adverse effects on our income  

we and a number of our subsidiaries are foreign corporations that derive income from a us trade or business andor from sources within the united states drinker biddle  reath llp our us tax counsel has delivered to us an opinion based on certain representations and assumptions set forth in it to the effect that this income to the extent derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships is excluded from gross income for us federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 883 of the internal revenue code we believe that most of our income including that of our subsidiaries is derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships 

our ability to rely on section 883 could be challenged or could change in the future provisions of the internal revenue code including section 883 are subject to legislative change at any time moreover changes could occur in the future with respect to the identity residence or holdings of our direct or indirect shareholders trading volume or trading frequency of our shares or relevant foreign tax laws of liberia such that it no longer qualifies as an equivalent exemption jurisdiction that could affect our eligibility for the section 883 exemption accordingly there can be no assurance that we will continue to be exempt from us income tax on us source shipping income in the future if we were not entitled to the benefit of section 883 we and our subsidiaries would be subject to us taxation on a portion of the income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships which would reduce our net income 

additionally portions of our business are operated by companies that are within tonnage tax regimes of the united kingdom and malta further some of our operations are conducted in jurisdictions where we rely on tax treaties to provide exemption from taxation to the extent the tonnage tax laws of these countries change or we do not continue to meet the applicable qualification requirements or if tax treaties are changed or revoked we may be required to pay higher income tax in these jurisdictions adversely impacting our results of operations 

as budgetary constraints continue to adversely impact the jurisdictions in which we operate increases in income tax regulations tax audits or tax reform affecting our operations may be imposed 

litigation enforcement actions fines or penalties could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations andor damage our reputation 

our business is subject to various united states and international laws and regulations that could lead to enforcement actions fines civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims and damages in addition improper conduct by our employees agents or joint venture partners could damage our reputation andor lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties including substantial monetary fines in certain circumstances it may not be economical to defend against such matters andor a legal strategy may not ultimately result in us prevailing in a matter such events could lead to an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

we are not a united states corporation and our shareholders may be subject to the uncertainties of a foreign legal system in protecting their interests 

our corporate affairs are governed by our articles of incorporation and bylaws and by the business corporation act of liberia the provisions of the business corporation act of liberia resemble provisions of the corporation laws of a number of states in the united states however while most states have a fairly well developed body of case law interpreting their respective corporate statutes there are very few judicial cases in liberia interpreting the business corporation act of liberia as such the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under liberian law are not as clearly established as the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under statutes or judicial precedent in certain united states jurisdictions for example the right of shareholders to bring a derivative action in liberian courts may be more limited than in united states jurisdictions there may also be practical difficulties for shareholders attempting to bring suit in liberia and liberian courts may or may not recognize and enforce foreign judgments thus our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests with respect to actions by management directors or controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a united states jurisdiction 

provisions of our articles of incorporation bylaws and liberian law could inhibit others from acquiring us prevent a change of control and may prevent efforts by our shareholders to change our management 

certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and liberian law may inhibit third parties from effectuating a change of control of the company without board approval which could result in the entrenchment of current management these include provisions in our articles of incorporation that prevent third parties other than a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates from acquiring beneficial ownership of more than 49 of our outstanding shares without the consent of our board of directors

we also operate two private destinations which we utilize as portsofcall on certain of our itineraries i an island we own in the bahamas which we call cococay and ii labadee a secluded peninsula we lease on the north coast of haiti 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

in april 2015 the alaska department of environmental conservation issued notices of violation to royal caribbean international and celebrity cruises seeking monetary penalties for alleged violations of the alaska marine visible emission standards that occurred over the previous five years on certain of our vessels in february 2017 we settled all claims pursuant to a compliance order by consent in which we agreed to pay an amount and perform certain remedial actions which individually and in the aggregate are immaterial to our financial condition or results of operations and cash flows 

we are routinely involved in other claims typical within the cruise vacation industry the majority of these claims are covered by insurance we believe the outcome of such claims net of expected insurance recoveries will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations and cash flows

overview 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations have been organized to present the following 



critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap refer to note 1 general  and note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  certain of our accounting policies are deemed critical as they require managements highest degree of judgment estimates and assumptions we have discussed these accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors we believe our most critical accounting policies are as follows 

ship accounting 

our ships represent our most significant assets and are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization depreciation of ships is generally computed net of a 15 projected residual value using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of the asset which is generally 30 years the 30year useful life of our newly constructed ships and 15 associated residual value are both based on the weightedaverage of all major components 

of a ship our useful life and residual value estimates take into consideration the impact of anticipated technological changes longterm cruise and vacation market conditions and historical useful lives of similarlybuilt ships in addition we take into consideration our estimates of the weightedaverage useful lives of the ships major component systems such as hull superstructure main electric engines and cabins given the very large and complex nature of our ships our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain we do not have cost segregation studies performed to specifically componentize our ship systems therefore we estimate the costs of component systems based principally on general and technical information known about major ship component systems and their lives and our knowledge of the cruise vacation industry we do not identify and track depreciation by ship component systems but instead utilize these estimates to determine the net cost basis of assets replaced or refurbished improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized as additions to the ship and depreciated over the shorter of the improvements estimated useful lives or that of the associated ship the estimated cost and accumulated depreciation of replaced or refurbished ship components are written off and any resulting losses are recognized in cruise operating expenses  

we use the deferral method to account for drydocking costs under the deferral method drydocking costs incurred are deferred and charged to expense on a straightline basis over the period to the next scheduled drydock which we estimate to be a period of thirty to sixty months based on the vessels age as required by class deferred drydock costs consist of the costs to drydock the vessel and other costs incurred in connection with the drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessels class certification class certification is necessary in order for our cruise ships to be flagged in a specific country obtain liability insurance and legally operate as passenger cruise ships the activities associated with those drydocking costs cannot be performed while the vessel is in service and as such are done during a drydock as a planned major maintenance activity the significant deferred drydock costs consist of hauling and wharfage services provided by the drydock facility hull inspection and related activities eg scraping pressure cleaning bottom painting maintenance to steering propulsion thruster equipment and ballast tanks port services such as tugs pilotage and line handling and freight associated with these items we perform a detailed analysis of the various activities performed for each drydock and only defer those costs that are directly related to planned major maintenance activities necessary to maintain class the costs deferred are related to activities not otherwise routinely periodically performed to maintain a vessels designed and intended operating capability repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred 

we use judgment when estimating the period between drydocks which can result in adjustments to the estimated amortization of drydock costs if the vessel is disposed of before the next drydock the remaining balance in deferred drydock is writtenoff to the gain or loss upon disposal of vessel in the period in which the sale takes place we also use judgment when identifying costs incurred during a drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessels class certification as compared to those costs attributable to repairs and maintenance which are expensed as incurred 

we believe we have made reasonable estimates for ship accounting purposes however should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimates of ship useful lives or projected residual values depreciation expense could be materially higher or lower if circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making determinations as to whether ship improvements should be capitalized the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance costs could increase partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense if we had reduced our estimated average ship useful life by one year depreciation expense for 2016  would have increased by approximately 627 million  if our ships were estimated to have no residual value depreciation expense for 2016  would have increased by approximately 2219 million  

valuation of goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets and longlived assets 

we review goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or when events or circumstances dictate more frequently the impairment review for goodwill consists of a qualitative assessment of whether it is morelikelythannot that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount and if necessary a twostep goodwill impairment test factors to consider when performing the qualitative assessment include general economic conditions limitations on accessing capital changes in forecasted operating results changes in fuel prices and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates if the qualitative assessment demonstrates that it is morelikelythannot that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value it is not necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to step 

one for any reporting unit in any period on a periodic basis we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed to step one to corroborate the results of recent years qualitative assessments we can resume the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any subsequent period 

when performing the twostep goodwill impairment test the fair value of the reporting unit is determined and compared to the carrying value of the net assets allocated to the reporting unit we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a probabilityweighted discounted cash flow model the estimation of fair value utilizing discounted expected future cash flows includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of expected revenues operating costs marketing selling and administrative expenses interest rates ship additions and retirements as well as assumptions regarding the cruise vacation industrys competitive environment and general economic and business conditions among other factors the principal assumptions we use in the discounted cash flow model are projected operating results weightedaverage cost of capital and terminal value the discounted cash flow model uses the most current projected operating results for the upcoming fiscal year as a base to that base we add future years cash flows assuming multiple revenue and expense scenarios that reflect the impact of different global economic environments beyond the base year on the reporting unit we discount the projected cash flows using rates specific to the reporting unit based on its weightedaverage cost of capital if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value no further analysis or writedown of goodwill is required if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of its net assets the implied fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all its underlying assets and liabilities including both recognized and unrecognized tangible and intangible assets based on their fair value if necessary goodwill is then written down to its implied fair value 

the impairment review for indefinitelife intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount we estimate the fair value of these assets using a discounted cash flow model and various valuation methods depending on the nature of the intangible asset such as the relieffromroyalty method for trademarks and tradenames if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess if the fair value exceeds its carrying amount the indefinitelife intangible asset is not considered impaired as of december 31 2016  the carrying amount of indefinitelife intangible assets was not material other intangible assets assigned finite useful lives are amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives 

we review our ships aircraft and other longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable we evaluate asset impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities the lowest level for which we maintain identifiable cash flows that are independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities is at the ship level for our ships and at the aggregated asset group level for our aircraft if estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of an asset an impairment charge is recognized to the extent its carrying value exceeds fair value 

we estimate fair value based on quoted market prices in active markets if available if active markets are not available we base fair value on independent appraisals sales price negotiations and projected future cash flows discounted at a rate estimated by management to be commensurate with the business risk quoted market prices are often not available for individual reporting units and for indefinitelife intangible assets accordingly we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit and an indefinitelife intangible asset using an expected present value technique 

royal caribbean international 

during the fourth quarter of 2016  we performed a qualitative assessment of the royal caribbean international reporting unit based on our qualitative assessment we concluded that it was morelikelythannot that the estimated fair value of the royal caribbean international reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and thus we did not proceed to the twostep goodwill impairment test no indicators of impairment exist primarily because the reporting units fair value has consistently exceeded its carrying value by a significant margin its financial performance has been solid in the face of mixed economic environments and forecasts of operating results generated by the reporting unit appear sufficient to support its carrying value as of december 31 2016  the carrying amount of goodwill attributable to our royal caribbean reporting unit was 2868 million  

2015 impairment of pullmantur related assets 

during the third quarter of 2015 we performed an interim impairment evaluation of pullmantur’s goodwill and trademarks and trade names in connection with the preparation of our financial statements as a result of this analysis we determined that the carrying value of the pullmantur reporting unit exceeded its fair value similarly we determined that the carrying value of pullmantur’s trademarks and trade names exceeded their fair value accordingly upon the completion of the relevant impairment tests discussed above we recognized impairment charges of 1238 million   and 1743 million  for goodwill and trademark and trade names respectively during the quarter ended september 30 2015 these charges reflected the full carrying amounts of the goodwill and trademark and trade names leaving pullmantur with no intangible assets on its books 

derivative instruments 

we enter into various forward swap and option contracts to manage our interest rate exposure and to limit our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices these instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value and the vast majority are designated as hedges we also use nonderivative financial instruments designated as hedges of our net investment in our foreign operations and investments although certain of our derivative financial instruments do not qualify or are not accounted for under hedge accounting we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes we account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with authoritative guidance refer to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  and note 14 fair value measurements and derivative instruments  to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for more information on related authoritative guidance the companys hedging programs and derivative financial instruments 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and collars interest rate crosscurrency and fuel swaps and options with thirdparty institutions in overthecounter markets we estimate the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate and crosscurrency swaps using expected future cash flows based on the instruments contract terms and published forward prices for foreign currency exchange and interest rates we apply present value techniques and libor or euriborbased discount rates to convert the expected future cash flows to the current fair value of the instruments 

we estimate the fair value of our foreign currency collars using standard option pricing models with inputs based on the options contract terms such as exercise price and maturity and readily available public market data such as foreign exchange prices foreign exchange volatility levels and discount rates 

we estimate the fair value of our fuel swaps using expected future cash flows based on the swaps contract terms and forward prices we derive forward prices from forward fuel curves based on pricing inputs provided by thirdparty institutions that transact in the fuel indices we hedge we validate these pricing inputs against actual market transactions and published price quotes for similar assets we apply present value techniques and liborbased discount rates to convert the expected future cash flows to the current fair value of the instruments we also corroborate our fair value estimates using valuations provided by our counterparties 

we adjust the valuation of our derivative financial instruments to incorporate credit risk 

we believe it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate crosscurrency and fuel swaps and options would be derived from other appropriate valuation models using similar assumptions inputs or conditions suggested by actual historical experience 

contingencies—litigation 

on an ongoing basis we assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss if any can be made in assessing probable losses we take into consideration estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries if any which are recorded as assets when recoverability is probable we accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recoveries it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made 

seasonality 

our revenues are seasonal based on demand for cruises demand is strongest for cruises during the northern hemispheres summer months and holidays in order to mitigate the impact of the winter weather in the northern hemisphere and to capitalize on the summer season in the southern hemisphere our brands have focused on deployment to the caribbean asia and australia during that period 

financial presentation 

description of certain line items 

revenues 

our revenues are comprised of the following 

 cruise operating expenses 

our cruise operating expenses are comprised of the following 

 we do not allocate payroll and related expenses food expenses fuel expenses or other operating expenses to the expense categories attributable to passenger ticket revenues or onboard and other revenues since they are incurred to provide the total cruise vacation experience 

selected operational and financial metrics 

we utilize a variety of operational and financial metrics which are defined below to evaluate our performance and financial condition as discussed in more detail herein certain of these metrics are nongaap financial measures which we believe provide useful information to investors as a supplement to our consolidated financial statements which are prepared and presented in accordance with gaap the presentation of nongaap financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap 

adjusted earnings per share adjusted eps  represents adjusted net income divided by weighted average shares outstanding or by diluted weighted average shares outstanding as applicable we believe that this nongaap measure is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis 

adjusted net income  represents net income excluding certain items that we believe adjusting for is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis for the periods presented these items included the impairment of the pullmantur related assets the net loss related to the elimination of the pullmantur reporting lag the net gain related to the sale of the pullmantur and cdf brands and related costs restructuring charges and other initiative costs related to our pullmantur rightsizing strategy and other restructuring initiatives the estimated impact of the divested pullmantur noncore businesses for periods prior to the sales transaction the loss recognized on the sale of celebrity century the impact of the change in our voyage proration methodology and the reversal of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance due to spanish tax reform the estimated impact of the divested pullmantur noncore businesses was arrived at by adjusting the net income loss of these businesses for the ownership percentage we retained as well as for intercompany transactions that are no longer eliminated in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss subsequent to the sales transaction for the full year 2014 the impact of the voyage proration change represents net income that would have been recognized in 2013 had we recognized revenues and cruise operating expenses on a prorata basis for all voyages 

available passenger cruise days  apcd is our measurement of capacity and represents double occupancy per cabin multiplied by the number of cruise days for the period we use this measure to perform capacity and rate analysis to identify our main noncapacity drivers that cause our cruise revenue and expenses to vary 

doubledouble   program refers to the multiyear adjusted eps and return on invested capital roic goals we publicly announced in 2014 and are seeking to achieve by the end of 2017 we designed this program to help us better execute and achieve our business goals by clearly articulating longerterm financial objectives under the doubledouble program we are targeting adjusted eps of 678 by the end of 2017 which is double our 2014 adjusted eps of 339 we are also targeting roic of 10 by the end of 2017 as compared to roic of 59 in 2014 

gross cruise costs  represent the sum of total cruise operating expenses plus marketing selling and administrative expenses 

gross yields  represent total revenues per apcd 

net cruise costs  and net cruise costs excluding fuel  represent gross cruise costs excluding commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses and in the case of net cruise costs excluding fuel fuel expenses each of which is described above under the description of certain line items  heading in measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income we believe changes in net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance a reconciliation of historical gross cruise costs to net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel is provided below under results of operations  we have not provided a quantitative reconciliation of projected gross cruise costs to projected net cruise costs and projected net cruise costs excluding fuel due to the significant uncertainty in projecting the costs deducted to arrive at these measures accordingly we do not believe that reconciling information for such projected figures would be meaningful for the periods prior to the sale of the pullmantur noncore businesses net cruise costs excludes the estimated impact of these divested businesses net cruise costs also excludes the net gain related to the sale of the pullmantur and cdf brands and related costs and initiative costs related to our pullmantur rightsizing strategy and other restructuring initiatives as well as the loss recognized on the sale of celebrity century 

net revenues represent total revenues less commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses each of which is described above under the description of certain line items  heading for the periods prior to the sale of the pullmantur noncore businesses we have presented net revenues excluding the estimated impact of these divested businesses in the financial tables under results of operations  

net yields  represent net revenues per apcd we utilize net revenues and net yields to manage our business on a daytoday basis as we believe that it is the most relevant measure of our pricing performance because it reflects the cruise revenues earned by us net of our most significant variable costs which are commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses a reconciliation of historical gross yields to net yields is provided below under results of operations  we have not provided a quantitative reconciliation of projected gross yields to projected net yields due to the significant uncertainty in projecting the costs deducted to arrive at this measure accordingly we do not believe that reconciling information for such projected figures would be meaningful for the periods prior to the sale of the pullmantur noncore businesses net yields excludes the estimated impact of these divested businesses net yields also excludes initiative costs related to the sale of the pullmantur and cdf brands 

occupancy  in accordance with cruise vacation industry practice is calculated by dividing passenger cruise days by apcd a percentage in excess of 100 indicates that three or more passengers occupied some cabins 

passenger cruise days  represent the number of passengers carried for the period multiplied by the number of days of their respective cruises 

we believe net yields net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel are our most relevant nongaap financial measures however a significant portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar because our reporting currency is the united states dollar the value of these revenues and expenses can be affected by changes in currency exchange rates although such changes in local currency prices are just one of many elements impacting our revenues and expenses they can be an important element for this reason we also monitor net yields net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel as if the current periods currency exchange rates had remained constant with the comparable prior periods rates or on a constant currency basis 

it should be emphasized that constant currency is primarily used for comparing shortterm changes andor projections changes in guest sourcing and shifting the amount of purchases between currencies can change the impact of the purely currencybased fluctuations 

the use of certain significant nongaap measures such as net yields net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel allows us to perform capacity and rate analysis to separate the impact of known capacity changes from other less predictable changes which affect our business we believe these nongaap measures provide expanded insight to measure revenue and cost performance in addition to the standard united states gaap based financial measures there are no specific rules or regulations for determining nongaap and constant currency measures and as such there exists the possibility that they may not be comparable to other companies within the industry 

executive overview 

the year 2016 marked the penultimate year of our doubledouble program doubledouble which we implemented in 2014 to challenge our employees towards a true step change in performance as part of this effort we set two multiyear financial targets including doubling our 2014 adjusted earnings per share “adjusted eps” and achieving doubledigit return on invested capital “roic” by the end of 2017 by communicating these goals to our employees we have been able to better align and influence internal decision making and energize and focus our personnel towards reaching these targets our longterm commitment to grow revenue yields manage costs and maintain steady capacity growth continues to guide us towards doubledouble while our doubledouble goals are demanding they are consistent with and reflect the trajectory of our business over the last several years in which we have experienced annual adjusted eps growth of approximately 39 42 and 26 and annual roic growth of approximately 16 29 and 17 in each of 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively 

our 2016 net income was 13 billion  or 593  per diluted share compared to 6658 million or 302 per diluted share in 2015 adjusted net income for 2016 was 13 billion  or 608  per diluted share compared to 11 billion or 483 per diluted share in 2015 adjusted eps for 2016 represents the third straight year we achieved a record amount growing over 25 on 2015 

additionally net yields on a constantcurrency basis increased for the seventh consecutive year for the year ended december 31 2016 our net yields on a constantcurrency basis increased by 39 primarily driven by increases in both ticket and onboard yields and by a benefit from the deconsolidation of the pullmantur brand from the rest of the company in august the success of north american based sailings such as the caribbean alaska and bermuda were largely responsible for our organic revenue growth higher yields were also generated by the introductions of two new ships in 2016  ovation of the seas  in april and harmony of the seas in may partly offsetting these successes was softer than anticipated demand from the china market and the continued geopolitical turmoil in europe resulting in a shift of sourcing from north american guests to european guests particularly for mediterranean sailings 

net onboard revenue yield in 2016 grew by 78 yearoveryear on a constant currency basis despite the increasing value of the dollar relative to our basket of foreign currencies which created an unfavorable impact on our earnings and limited the spending power of our foreign guests growth came from a variety of areas most notably from beverage package sales and our high speed onboard internet products we expect to continue this upward onboard yield growth trend in 2017 and expect them to grow by slightly more than the average net revenue yield growth for the year 

 we remain dedicated to finding efficiencies identifying synergies and reducing costs while at the same time focusing on strategic investments in areas that will boost revenue in 2016 our net cruise costs excluding fuel increased by 09 on a constant currency basis compared to 2015 going into 2017 we expect net cruise costs excluding fuel on a constant currency basis to be flat as we remain intensely focused on cost controls and further realize economies of scale 

the company remains focused on improving returns for our shareholders in 2016 we bought back 300 million shares of common stock completing our 500 million share repurchase program that was announced in october 2015 additionally in september 2016 we announced a 28 increase to our common stock dividend 

for the year 2017 our capacity in the caribbean will increase yearoveryear as harmony of the seas and celebrity equinox  will remain in the caribbean yearround rather than spending the summer in europe while  harmony of the seas  will be replaced by freedom of the seas  in europe we will not be replacing celebrity equinox  in the eastern mediterranean the combination of these deployment changes result in a reduction in capacity in europe our capacity in the asia pacific region is expected to grow 5 yearoveryear primarily due to the first full year of deployment for  ovation of the seas  industrywide capacity in the region is expected to grow 17 slowing from the 34 growth increase the region experienced in 2016 

in may 2016 we announced the order of our fifth oasisclass ship for delivery in the spring of 2021 and two additional edgeclass ships scheduled for delivery in the fall of each of 2021 and 2022 in addition to investing in new hardware we opportunistically evaluate selling or transferring older ships to further optimize our fleet since 2014 we have sold or are about to sell four ships that are expected to improve our roic  the sale of celebrity century  to a subsidiary of skysea holdings the sale of ocean dream  to an unrelated third party the sale of splendour of the seas  to tui cruises and most recently the pending sale of legend of the seas to thomson cruises 

results of operations 

in addition to the items discussed above under executive overview significant items for 2016  include 

 

 

other items for 2016 include 

 

 

 

 we reported net income adjusted net income earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share as shown in the following table in thousands except per share data 



1 includes a net deferred income tax benefit of 120 million  related to the pullmantur impairment 

2 represents the net income amount that would have been recognized in 2013 had we recognized revenues and cruise operating expenses on a prorata basis for all voyages 

the following table presents operating results as a percentage of total revenues for the last three years 

selected statistical information is shown in the following table 



1 does not include november and december 2015 amounts related to the elimination of the pullmantur reporting lag since the impact is included within other expense income in our   consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss for the year ended december 31 2016 additionally effective august 2016 we no longer include pullmantur holdings in these amounts 

gross yields and net yields were calculated as follows in thousands except apcd and yields 



gross cruise costs net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel were calculated as follows in thousands except apcd and costs per apcd 

1  for the year ended december 31 2016 amount does not include fuel expense of 04 million included within other initiative costs associated with the redeployment of pullmantur’s empress to the royal caribbean international brand 

outlook 

the company does not make predictions about fuel pricing interest rates or currency exchange rates but does provide guidance about its future business activities on january 26 2017  we announced the following initial full year and first  quarter 2017  guidance based on the then current fuel pricing interest rates and currency exchange rates 

full year 2017 



first quarter 2017   



since our earnings release on january 26 2017  bookings have remained encouraging and consistent with our previous expectations accordingly our forecast has remained essentially unchanged 

volatility in foreign currency exchange rates affects the united states dollar value of our earnings based on our highest net exposure for each quarter and the full year 2017 the top five foreign currencies are ranked below for example the australian dollar is the most impactful currency in the first and fourth quarters of 2017 rankings are based on estimated net exposures 



the currency abbreviations above are defined as follows 



year ended december 31 2016  compared to year ended december 31 2015   

in this section references to 2016  refer to the year ended december 31 2016  and references to 2015  refer to the year ended december 31 2015  

revenues 

total revenues for 2016  increased 1973 million  or 24  to 85 billion  from 83 billion  in 2015  

passenger ticket revenues  comprised 724  of our 2016  total revenues passenger ticket revenues increased by 905 million  or 15  the increase was primarily due to 

 

 

the increase in passenger ticket revenues was partially offset by the unfavorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar of approximately 1715 million  

the remaining 276  of 2016  total revenues was comprised of onboard and other revenues  which increased 1068 million  or 48  the increase in onboard and other revenues  was primarily due to 

 

 

the increase was partially offset by 

 

 

onboard and other revenues  included concession revenues of 3169 million  in 2016  and 3271 million  in 2015  

cruise operating expenses 

total cruise operating expenses for 2016  decreased 839 million  or 16  to 50 billion  in 2016 from 51 billion  in 2015  the decrease was primarily due to 

 

 

 

 

 

the decrease was partially offset by a 1647 million  increase attributable to the 33  increase in capacity noted above 

marketing selling and administrative expenses 

marketing selling and administrative expenses  for 2016 remained consistent compared to 2015 

depreciation and amortization expenses 

depreciation and amortization expenses  for 2016  increased 679 million  or 82  to 8949 million  from 8270 million  in 2015  the increase was primarily due to the addition of  harmony of the seas and ovation of the seas in the second quarter of 2016 into our fleet and the addition of anthem of the seas in the second quarter of 2015 and to a lesser extent new shipboard additions associated with our ship upgrade projects the increase was partially offset by the sale of splendour of the seas  in april 2016 

impairment of pullmantur related assets 

during 2015 we recognized an impairment charge of 4113 million to write down pullmanturs goodwill to its implied fair value and to write down trademarks and trade names and certain longlived assets consisting of three aircraft owned and operated by pullmantur air and two ships owned and operated by pullmantur to their fair value 

restructuring charges 

we incurred restructuring charges of approximately 85 million  in 2016 refer to note 16 restructuring charges  to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further information on our restructuring initiatives 

other income expense 

interest expense net of interest capitalized  increased 296 million  or 107  to 3074 million  in 2016  from 2777 million  in 2015  the increase was due to a higher average debt level attributable to the financing of ovation of the seas  and harmony of the seas  partially offset by lower pricing on debt refinanced in 2015 

equity investment income  increased 473 million  or 584  to 1284 million  in 2016  from 810 million  in 2015 mainly due to the increase in income from tui cruises one of our equity method investments 

other expense in 2016  was 357 million  compared to 244 million  in 2015  the increase in expense of 112 million  was primarily due to a net loss of 217 million  related to the elimination of the pullmantur reporting lag in 2016 the increase in other expense was partially offset by a decrease of 96 million  in foreign exchange losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency 

net yields 

net yields increased 16  in 2016  compared to 2015  primarily due to the increase in passenger ticket and onboard and other revenues discussed above net yields increased 39  in 2016  compared to 2015  on a constant currency basis 

net cruise costs 

net cruise costs increased 10  in 2016  compared to 2015  primarily due to the increase in capacity partially offset by the decrease in fuel which are further discussed above net cruise costs per apcd decreased 22  in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to the decrease in fuel net cruise costs per apcd on a constant currency basis decreased 17  in 2016 compared to 2015  

net cruise costs excluding fuel 

net cruise costs excluding fuel per apcd remained consistent in 2016  compared to 2015  and increased 09  in 2016 compared to 2015 on a constant currency basis 

other comprehensive income 

other comprehensive income in 2016 was 4119 million   compared to a loss of   4314 million  in 2015 the change of 8434 million  was primarily due to the gain on cash flow derivative hedges  in 2016 of 4112 million  compared to the loss on cash flow derivative hedges  of 4060 million  in 2015 the gain in 2016 resulted mostly from the reclassification of losses to earnings during 2016 from fuel cash flow hedges in addition there was an increase in the fair value of our fuel swaps in 2016 as a result of higher forward fuel prices the loss in 2015 was primarily due to the decrease in the fair value of our fuel swaps and of our foreign currency forward contracts as a result of decreases in fuel prices and forward currency rates somewhat offset by the reclassification of losses to earnings during 2015 from fuel cash flow hedges 

year ended december 31 2015 compared to year ended december 31 2014 

in this section references to 2015 refer to the year ended december 31 2015 and references to 2014 refer to the year ended december 31 2014 

revenues 

total revenues for 2015 increased 2252 million or 28 to 83 billion from 81 billion in 2014 

passenger ticket revenues  comprised 730 of our 2015 total revenues passenger ticket revenues increased by 1650 million or 28 to 61 billion in 2015 from 59 billion in 2014 the increase was primarily due to 

 

 

the increase in passenger ticket revenues was partially offset by the unfavorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar of approximately 3336 million 

the remaining 270 of 2015 total revenues was comprised of onboard and other revenues  which increased 602 million or 28 the increase in onboard and other revenues  was primarily due to 

 

 

the increase was partially offset by 

 

 

onboard and other revenues  included concession revenues of 3271 million in 2015 and 3243 million in 2014 

cruise operating expenses 

total cruise operating expenses for 2015 decreased 2069 million or 39 to 51 billion in 2015 from 53 billion in 2014 the decrease was primarily due to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the decrease was partially offset by a 2767 million increase attributable to a 54 increase in capacity noted above net of the favorable impact of the change in our voyage proration 

marketing selling and administrative expenses 

marketing selling and administrative expenses  for 2015 increased 376 million or 36 the increase was primarily due to an increase in advertising spending mainly relating to our initiatives in the north american australian and asian markets an increase in payroll and benefits primarily due to an increase in our stock price over the past year related to our performance share awards and higher it labor costs resulting from the addition of projects and initiatives in 2015 the increase was partially offset by a decrease in administrative expenses mainly driven by the sale of pullmanturs noncore businesses in 2014 and savings realized from our cost containment initiatives 

depreciation and amortization expenses 

depreciation and amortization expenses  for 2015 increased 546 million or 71 to 8270 million from 7724 million in 2014 the increase was primarily due to the addition of  quantum of the seas  and anthem of the seas  into our fleet new shipboard additions associated with our ship upgrade projects and the acquisition of the brilliance of the seas  which was previously under lease partially offset by the sale of celebrity century  in september 2014 

impairment of pullmantur related assets 

during 2015 we recognized an impairment charge of 4113 million to write down pullmanturs goodwill to its implied fair value and to write down trademarks and trade names and certain longlived assets consisting of three aircraft owned by pullmantur and two ships owned and operated by pullmantur to their fair value refer to note 3 goodwill  and note 4 intangible assets  to our consolidated financial statements for further information on the impairment of these assets 

restructuring charges 

we incurred restructuring charges of approximately 43 million in 2014 which did not recur in 2015 

other income expense 

interest expense net of interest capitalized  increased 194 million or 75 to 2777 million in 2015 from 2583 million in 2014 the increase was primarily due to a higher average debt level attributable to the financing of quantum of the seas  and anthem of the seas  partially offset by lower pricing on debt refinanced in 2015 and 2014 

equity investment income  increased 294 million or 569 to 810 million in 2015 from 516 million in 2014 mainly due to the increase in income from tui cruises one of our equity method investments 

other expense in 2015 was 244 million compared to other income  of 186 million in 2014 the increase in expense of 430 million was primarily due to a 335 million tax benefit related to the reversal of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance resulting from spanish tax reform in 2014 which did not recur in 2015 and 209 million in foreign exchange losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency in 2015 compared to 09 million in gains in 2014 the increase in other expense was partially offset by a net deferred tax 

benefit of 120 million resulting from the impairment of the pullmantur related assets in 2015 which did not occur in 2014 

net yields 

net yields decreased 10 in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the unfavorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our passenger ticket revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar noted above net yields increased 35 in 2015 compared to 2014 on a constant currency basis primarily due to the increase in passenger ticket and onboard and other revenues discussed above 

net cruise costs 

net cruise costs decreased 19 in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the decrease in fuel and the favorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our cruise operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar partially offset by an increase in capacity net cruise costs per apcd decreased 69 in 2015 compared to 2014 net cruise costs per apcd on a constant currency basis decreased 47 in 2015 compared to 2014 

net cruise costs excluding fuel 

net cruise costs excluding fuel per apcd decreased 32 in 2015 compared to 2014 and remained consistent in 2015 compared to 2014 on a constant currency basis 

other comprehensive loss 

other comprehensive loss decreased by 4712 million in 2015 compared to 2014 due to a 4633 million decrease in losses on cash flow derivative hedges resulting mostly from the reclassification of losses to earnings during 2015 from fuel cash flow hedges

liquidity and capital resources 

sources and uses of cash   

cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity net cash provided by operating activities increased 5703 million  to 25 billion  for 2016  compared to 19 billion  for 2015  the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to an increase in proceeds from customer deposits an increase in cash receipts from onboard spending and a decrease in fuel costs in 2016  compared to 2015  additionally dividends received from unconsolidated affiliates increased by 426 million  

net cash provided by operating activities increased 2026 million to 19 billion for 2015 compared to 17 billion for 2014 the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to an increase in proceeds from customer deposits an increase in cash receipts from onboard spending and a decrease in fuel costs and interest paid in 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 

net cash used in investing activities increased 9819 million  to 27 billion  in 2016  compared to 17 billion  in 2015  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in capital expenditures of 8810 million  in 2016  compared to the same period in 2015  primarily due to the deliveries of ovation of the seas  and harmony of the seas  in 2016  additionally cash repayments received on loans to our unconsolidated affiliates decreased 860 million  in 2016   

compared to the same period in 2015  mainly due to tui cruises repaying in 2015 the outstanding balance of the debt facility we originally provided to them in 2011 

net cash used in investing activities decreased 274 million in 2015 compared to 2014 during 2015 our use of cash was primarily related to capital expenditures of 16 billion down from 18 billion in 2014 the decrease in capital expenditures during 2015 was primarily attributable to the purchase of brilliance of the seas in 2014 the decrease in cash used in investing activities was also due to a decrease in investments in and loans to unconsolidated affiliates of 1324 million in 2015 compared to 2014 and an increase in cash repayments received on loans to unconsolidated affiliates of 481 million in 2015 compared to 2014 the decrease was partially offset by 2200 million of proceeds received from the sale of celebrity century  in 2014 that did not recur in 2015 additionally there was an increase in cash paid on the settlement of derivative financial instruments of 1105 million 

net cash provided by financing activities was 2438 million  for 2016  compared to net cash used in financing activities of   2535 million  in 2015  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in debt proceeds of 29 billion  during 2016  compared to 2015  partially offset by an increase in repayment of debt of 22 billion  an increase in stock repurchases of 1000 million   and an increase in dividends paid of 663 million  during 2016  compared to 2015  the increase in debt proceeds was primarily due to the 8418 million unsecured term loan borrowed in april 2016 to finance ovation of the sea s the €7007 million and 2261 million unsecured term loans borrowed in may 2016 to finance harmony of the seas  the 2000 million unsecured term loan borrowed in april 2016 and higher drawings on our revolving credit facilities during 2016  compared to the 7421 million unsecured term loan borrowed in april 2015 to finance anthem of the seas  the increase in repayment of debt was primarily due to higher payments on our revolving credit facilities 

net cash used in financing activities was 2535 million for 2015 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of  175 million in 2014 this change was primarily due to an increase of 3943 million in repayment of debt an increase of dividends paid of 813 million and a decrease in the proceeds from the exercise of common stock options of 596 million the increase in cash used in financing activities was partially offset by a 2455 million increase in debt proceeds and a 361 million decrease in the repurchase of treasury stock the increase in repayment of debt was due to higher payments of 11 billion on our revolving credit facilities and a payment at maturity of 2790 million on our 11875 unsecured senior notes during 2015 compared to the payment at maturity of our €7450 million 5625 unsecured senior notes during 2014 the increase in debt proceeds was primarily due to the 7421 million unsecured term loan borrowed to finance the purchase of anthem of the seas and higher drawings of 7060 million on our revolving credit facilities in 2015 compared to proceeds received on an unsecured term loan of 7911 million due to the delivery of quantum of the seas and proceeds received on our 3800 million unsecured term loan facility during 2014 

future capital commitments 

our future capital commitments consist primarily of new ship orders as of december 31 2016  we have two quantumclass ships and two oasisclass ships on order for our royal caribbean international brand with an aggregate capacity of approximately 19200 berths additionally we have four project edge ships on order for our celebrity cruises brand with an aggregate capacity of approximately 11600 berths for each of these orders we have committed unsecured financing arrangements in place covering 80 of the cost of the ship each of which include sovereign financing guarantees 

as of december 31 2016  the aggregate cost of our ships on order not including the tui cruises ships on order and the project icon ships which remain subject to conditions of effectiveness was approximately 84 billion  of which we had deposited 3161 million  as of such date approximately 667  of the aggregate cost was exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate at december 31 2016  refer to note 14 fair value measurements and derivative instruments and note 15 commitments and contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

as of december 31 2016  anticipated overall capital expenditures based on our existing ships on order are approximately 06 billion  for 2017  26 billion  for 2018  15 billion  for 2019  and 20 billion  for 2020  

contractual obligations 

as of december 31 2016  our contractual obligations were as follows in thousands 



 

1 we are obligated under noncancelable operating leases primarily for offices warehouses and motor vehicles amounts represent contractual obligations with initial terms in excess of one year 

2 longterm debt obligations mature at various dates through fiscal year 2028 and bear interest at fixed and variable rates interest on variablerate debt is calculated based on forecasted debt balances including the impact of interest rate swap agreements using the applicable rate at december 31 2016  debt denominated in other currencies is calculated based on the applicable exchange rate at december 31 2016  

3 amounts primarily represent future commitments with remaining terms in excess of one year to pay for our usage of certain port facilities marine consumables services and maintenance contracts amounts do not include the portmiami lease further discussed below under offbalance sheet arrangements  

4 amounts do not include potential obligations which remain subject to cancellation at our sole discretion in addition amounts do not include the conditional agreements with meyer turku for the two project icon ships 

5 amounts represent debt obligations with initial terms in excess of one year debt denominated in other currencies is calculated based on the applicable exchange rate at december 31 2016  

6 amounts represent capital lease obligations with initial terms in excess of one year 

7 amounts represent fees payable to sovereign guarantors in connection with certain of our export credit debt facilities and facility fees on our revolving credit facilities 

please refer to funding needs and sources  for discussion on the planned funding of the above contractual obligations 

as a normal part of our business depending on market conditions pricing and our overall growth strategy we continuously consider opportunities to enter into contracts for the building of additional ships we may also consider the sale of ships or the purchase of existing ships we continuously consider potential acquisitions and strategic alliances if any of these were to occur they would be financed through the incurrence of additional indebtedness the issuance of additional shares of equity securities or through cash flows from operations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we and tui ag have each guaranteed repayment of 50  of a bank loan provided to tui cruises which is due 2022 notwithstanding this the lenders have agreed to release each shareholder’s guarantee in 2018 as of december 31 2016  €1163 million  or approximately 1227 million  based on the exchange rate at december 31 2016  remains outstanding based on current facts and circumstances we do not believe potential obligations under this guarantee are probable 

tui cruises has entered into various ship construction and credit agreements that include certain restrictions on each of our and tui ags ability to reduce our current ownership interest in tui cruises below 3755  through 2021 

in july 2016 we executed an agreement with miami dade county “mdc” which was simultaneously assigned to sumitomo banking corporation “smbc” to lease land from mdc and construct a new cruise terminal at portmiami in miami florida the terminal is expected to be approximately 170000 square feet and will serve as a homeport during the construction period smbc will fund the costs of the terminal’s construction and land lease upon completion of the terminals construction we will operate and lease the terminal from smbc for a fiveyear term we determined that the lease arrangement between smbc and us should be accounted for as an operating lease upon completion of the terminal 

some of the contracts that we enter into include indemnification provisions that obligate us to make payments to the counterparty if certain events occur these contingencies generally relate to changes in taxes increased lender capital costs and other similar costs the indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms and are entered into in the normal course of business there are no stated or notional amounts included in the indemnification clauses and we are not able to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments if any under these indemnification clauses we have not been required to make any payments under such indemnification clauses in the past and under current circumstances we do not believe an indemnification obligation is probable 

as of december 31 2016  other than the items described above we are not party to any other offbalance sheet arrangements including guarantee contracts retained or contingent interest certain derivative instruments and variable interest entities that either have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial position 

funding needs and sources 

we have significant contractual obligations of which our debt service obligations and the capital expenditures associated with our ship purchases represent our largest funding needs as of december 31 2016  we have approximately 17 billion  in contractual obligations due through december 31 2017  of which approximately 11 billion  relates to longterm debt maturities 1081 million  relates to progress payments on our ship purchases and 2811 million  relates to interest on longterm debt we have historically relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations drawdowns under our available credit facilities the incurrence of additional debt andor the refinancing of our existing debt and the issuance of additional shares of equity securities to fund these obligations 

we had a working capital deficit of 37 billion  as of december 31 2016  as compared to a working capital deficit of 35 billion  as of december 31 2015  included within our working capital deficit is 13 billion  and 8995 million  of current portion of debt including capital leases as of december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  respectively the increase in working capital deficit was primarily due to the increase in current liabilities of our longterm debt and customer deposits similar to others in our industry we operate with a substantial working capital deficit this deficit is mainly attributable to the fact that under our business model a vast majority of our passenger ticket receipts are collected in advance of the applicable sailing date these advance passenger receipts remain a current liability until the sailing date the cash generated from these advance receipts is used interchangeably with cash on hand from other sources such as our revolving credit facilities and other cash from operations the cash received as advanced receipts can be used to fund operating expenses for the applicable future sailing or otherwise pay down our revolving credit facilities invest in long term investments or any other use of cash in addition we have a relatively lowlevel of accounts receivable and rapid turnover results in a limited investment in inventories we generate substantial cash flows from operations and our business model along with our unsecured revolving credit facilities has historically allowed us to maintain this working capital deficit and still meet our operating investing and financing needs we expect that we will continue to have working capital deficits in the future 

as of december 31 2016  we had liquidity of 9806 million  consisting of approximately 1326 million  in cash and cash equivalents and 8480 million  available under our unsecured credit facilities we anticipate that our cash flows from operations and our current financing arrangements as described above will be adequate to meet our capital expenditures and debt repayments over the next 12month period 

in october 2015 our board of directors authorized a common stock repurchase program for up to 500 million  that was completed in august 2016 during 2016 we purchased 41 million  shares for a total of 3000 million  in open market transactions these transactions were recorded within treasury stock in our consolidated balance sheet our repurchases under this program including the 21 million  shares repurchased for 2000 million  during the fourth quarter of 2015 totaled 5000 million  

if any person acquires ownership of more than 50 of our common stock or subject to certain exceptions during any 24month period a majority of the board is no longer comprised of individuals who were members of the board on the first day of such period we may be obligated to prepay indebtedness outstanding under our credit facilities which we may be unable to replace on similar terms our public debt securities also contain change of control provisions that would be triggered by a thirdparty acquisition of greater than 50 of our common stock coupled with a ratings downgrade if this were to occur it would have an adverse impact on our liquidity and operations 

debt covenants 

certain of our financing agreements contain financial covenants that require us among other things to maintain minimum net worth of at least 72 billion  a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 125x and limit our net debttocapital ratio to no more than 625  the fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated by dividing net cash from operations for the past four quarters by the sum of dividend payments plus scheduled principal debt payments in excess of any new financings for the past four quarters our minimum net worth and maximum net debttocapital calculations exclude the impact of accumulated other comprehensive loss on total shareholders equity  we are well in excess of all financial covenant requirements as of december 31 2016  the specific covenants and related definitions can be found in the applicable debt agreements the majority of which have been previously filed with the securities and exchange commission 

dividends 

in december 2016  we declared a cash dividend on our common stock of 048  per share which was paid in the first quarter of 2017  we declared a cash dividend on our common stock of 048  per share during the third quarter of 2016  which was paid in the fourth quarter of 2016  during the first and second quarters of 2016  we declared and paid a cash dividend on our common stock of 0375  per share during the first quarter of 2016  we also paid a cash dividend on our common stock of 0375  per share which was declared during the fourth quarter of 2015 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial instruments and other 

general 

we are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices we manage these risks through a combination of our normal operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments pursuant to our hedging practices and policies the financial impact of these hedging instruments is primarily offset by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures being hedged we achieve this by closely matching the amount term and conditions of the derivative instrument with the underlying risk being hedged although certain of our derivative financial instruments do not qualify or are not accounted for under hedge accounting we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes we monitor our derivative positions using techniques including market valuations and sensitivity analyses refer to note 14 fair value measurements   and derivative instruments to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our longterm debt obligations including future interest payments at december 31 2016  approximately 405  of our longterm debt was effectively fixed as compared to 312  as of december 31 2015  we use interest rate swap agreements to modify our exposure to interest rate movements and to manage our interest expense 

market risk associated with our longterm fixed rate debt is the potential increase in fair value resulting from a decrease in interest rates we use interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a portion of our fixedrate debt to a floatingrate basis to manage this risk at december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  we maintained interest rate swap agreements on the following fixedrate debt instruments 



these interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as fair value hedges 

the estimated fair value of our longterm fixedrate debt at december 31 2016  was 16 billion  using quoted market prices where available or using the present value of expected future cash flows which incorporates risk profile the fair value of our fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements was estimated to be a liability of 162 million  as of december 31 2016  based on the present value of expected future cash flows a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates at december 31 2016  would increase the fair value of our hedged and unhedged longterm fixedrate debt by approximately 834 million  and would increase the fair value of our fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements by approximately 398 million  

market risk associated with our longterm floatingrate debt is the potential increase in interest expense from an increase in interest rates we use interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a portion of our floatingrate debt to a fixedrate basis to manage this risk a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase our forecasted 2017  interest expense by approximately 427 million  assuming no change in foreign currency exchange rates 

at december 31 2016  and december 31 2015 we maintained interest rate swap agreements on the following floatingrate debt instruments 



1 interest rate swap agreements hedging the eurodenominated term loan for harmony of the seas  include euribor zerofloors matching the hedged debt euribor zerofloor amount presented is based on the exchange rate as of december 31 2016  

these interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges 

the fair value of our floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements was estimated to be a liability of 428 million  as of december 31 2016  based on the present value of expected future cash flows these interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to our ship construction contracts denominated in euros our foreign currency denominated debt and our international business operations we enter into foreign currency forward contracts collar options and crosscurrency swap agreements to manage portions of the exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 

the estimated fair value as of december 31 2016  of our eurodenominated forward contracts associated with our ship construction contracts was a liability of 737 million  based on the present value of expected future cash flows as of december 31 2016  the aggregate cost of our ships on order not including the tui cruises ships on order and those subject to conditions to effectiveness was approximately 84 billion  of which we had deposited 3161 million  as of such date approximately 667  and 582  of the aggregate cost of the ships under construction was exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate at december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  respectively a hypothetical 10 strengthening of the euro as of december 31 2016  assuming no changes in comparative interest rates would result in a 5580 million  increase in the united states dollar cost of the foreign currency denominated ship construction contracts exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate the majority of our foreign currency forward contracts collar options and crosscurrency swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow fair value or net investment hedges depending on the designation of the related hedge 

our international business operations subject us to foreign currency exchange risk we transact business in many different foreign currencies and maintain investments in foreign operations which may expose us to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates movements in foreign currency exchange rates may affect the value of our earnings in foreign currencies and cash flows we manage most of this exposure on a consolidated basis which allows us to take advantage of any natural offsets therefore weakness in one particular currency might be offset by strengths in other currencies over time the extent to which one currency is effective as a natural offset of another currency fluctuates over time in addition some foreign currency exposures have little to no mitigating natural offsets available 

we consider our investments in our foreign operations to be denominated in relatively stable currencies and of a longterm nature we partially mitigate the exposure of our investments in foreign operations by denominating a portion of our debt in our subsidiaries’ and investments’ functional currencies and designating it as a hedge of these subsidiaries and investments we had designated debt as a hedge of our net investments in tui cruises of approximately €2950 

million  or approximately 3112 million  through december 31 2016  as of december 31 2015 no debt was designated as a hedge of our net investments in pullmantur and tui cruises we have included approximately 1140 million  and 1045 million  of foreigncurrency transaction losses and of changes in the fair value of derivatives in the foreign currency translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive loss  at december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  respectively 

lastly on a regular basis we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and from time to time we utilize crosscurrency swap agreements to minimize the volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than our functional currency or the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries during 2016  we maintained an average of approximately 6424 million  of these foreign currency forward contracts these instruments are not designated as hedging instruments in 2016  2015  and 2014  changes in the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts were losses of approximately 511 million  555 million  and 486 million  respectively which offset gains arising from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies in those same years of 398 million  346 million  and 495 million  respectively these changes were recognized in earnings within other income expense in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss 

fuel price risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates primarily to the consumption of fuel on our ships fuel cost net of the financial impact of fuel swap agreements as a percentage of our total revenues was approximately 84  in 2016  96  in 2015  and 117  in 2014  we use fuel swap agreements to mitigate the financial impact of fluctuations in fuel prices 

as of december 31 2016  we had fuel swap agreements to pay fixed prices for fuel with an aggregate notional amount of approximately 10 billion  maturing through 2020  the fuel swap agreements represented 60  of our projected 2017  fuel requirements 44  of our projected 2018  fuel requirements 35  of our projected 2019  fuel requirements and 20  of our projected 2020  fuel requirements these fuel swap agreements are generally accounted for as cash flow hedges the estimated fair value of these contracts at december 31 2016  was estimated to be a liability of 2279 million  we estimate that a hypothetical 10  increase in our weightedaverage fuel price from that experienced during the year ended december 31 2016  would increase our forecasted 2017  fuel cost by approximately 300 million  net of the impact of fuel swap agreements

industry 

cruising is considered a wellestablished vacation sector in the north american and european markets and a developing but promising sector in several other emerging markets industry data indicates that market penetration rates are still low and that a significant portion of cruise guests carried are firsttime cruisers we believe this presents an opportunity for longterm growth and a potential for increased profitability 

the following table details market penetration rates for north america europe and asiapacific computed based on the number of annual cruise guests as a percentage of the total population 



 

 we estimate that the global cruise fleet was served by approximately 472000  berths on approximately 288  ships at the end of 2015  there are approximately 44  ships with an estimated 139000  berths that are expected to be placed in service in the global cruise market between 2016 and 2020 although it is also possible that ships could be ordered or taken out of service during these periods we estimate that the global cruise industry carried 230 million  cruise guests in 2015  compared to 220 million  cruise guests carried in 2014  and 213 million  cruise guests carried in 2013  

the following table details the growth in global weighted average berths and the global north american european and asiapacific cruise guests over the past five years in thousands except berth data

we do not carry business interruption insurance for our ships based on our evaluation of the risks involved and protective measures already in place as compared to the cost of insurance 

all insurance coverage is subject to certain limitations exclusions and deductible levels in addition in certain circumstances we either selfinsure or coinsure a portion of these risks premiums charged by insurance carriers including carriers in the maritime insurance industry increase or decrease from time to time and tend to be cyclical in nature these cycles are impacted both by our own loss experience and by losses incurred in direct and reinsurance markets we historically have been able to obtain insurance coverage in amounts and at premiums we have deemed to be commercially acceptable no assurance can be given that affordable and secure insurance markets will be available to us in the future particularly for war risk insurance

regulation 

our ships are regulated by various international national state and local laws regulations and treaties in force in the jurisdictions in which they operate in addition our ships are registered in the bahamas malta or in the case of celebrity xpedition  ecuador each ship is subject to regulations issued by its country of registry including regulations issued pursuant to international treaties governing the safety of our ships guests and crew as well as environmental protection each country of registry conducts periodic inspections to verify compliance with these regulations as discussed more fully below ships operating out of united states ports are subject to inspection by the united states coast guard for compliance with international treaties and by the united states public health service for sanitary and health conditions our ships are also subject to similar inspections pursuant to the laws and regulations of various other countries our ships visit 

we believe that we are in material compliance with all the regulations applicable to our ships and that we have all licenses necessary to conduct our business health safety security environmental and financial responsibility issues are and we believe will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant government authorities in the united states and internationally from time to time various regulatory and legislative changes may be proposed that could impact our operations and subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 

safety and security regulations 

our ships are required to comply with international safety standards defined in the international convention for safety of life at sea “solas” which among other things establishes requirements for ship design structural features materials construction life saving equipment and safe management and operation of ships to ensure guest and crew safety the solas standards are revised from time to time and the most recent modifications were phased in through 2010 compliance with these modified standards did not have a material effect on our operating costs solas incorporates the international safety management code “ism code” which provides an international standard for the safe management and operation of ships and for pollution prevention the ism code is mandatory for all vessels including passenger vessel operators 

all of our operations and ships are regularly audited by various national authorities and maintain the required certificates of compliance with the ism code 

our ships are subject to various security requirements including the international ship and port facility security code “isps code” which is part of solas and the us maritime transportation security act of 2002 “mtsa” which applies to ships that operate in us ports in order to satisfy these security requirements we implement security measures conduct vessel security assessments and develop security plans the security plans for all of our ships have been submitted to and approved by the respective countries of registry for our ships in compliance with the isps code and the mtsa 

the cruise vessel security and safety act of 2010 which applies to passenger vessels which embark or include port stops within the united states requires the implementation of certain safety design features as well as the establishment of practices for the reporting of and dealing with allegations of crime the cruise industry supported this legislation and we believe that our internal standards are generally as strict or stricter than the law requires a few provisions of the law call for regulations which have not yet been finalized however based on proposed regulations issued by the us coast guard in january 2015 we do not expect any material costs due to implementing these regulations 

environmental regulations 

we are subject to various international and national laws and regulations relating to environmental protection under such laws and regulations we are generally prohibited from discharging materials other than food waste into 

the waterways we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations from time to time environmental and other regulators consider more stringent regulations which may affect our operations and increase our compliance costs we believe that the impact of ships on the global environment will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world and accordingly may subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future including the items described below 

our ships are subject to the international maritime organization’s ‘‘imo’’ regulations under the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships the ‘‘marpol regulations’’ which includes requirements designed to minimize pollution by oil sewage garbage and air emissions we have obtained the relevant international compliance certificates relating to oil sewage and air pollution prevention for all of our ships 

the marpol regulations impose global limitations on the sulfur content of fuel used by ships operating worldwide to 35 the marpol regulations also establish special emission control areas ‘‘ecas’’ with stringent limitations on sulfur emissions in these areas as of february 2016 there are four established ecas that restrict sulfur emissions the baltic sea the north seaenglish channel certain waters surrounding the north american coast and the waters surrounding puerto rico and the us virgin islands the “caribbean eca” 

since january 1 2015 ships operating in these sulfur ecas have been required to reduce their fuel sulfur content from 10 to 01 this reduction did not have a significant impact on our results of operations in 2015 largely due to a number of mitigating steps we have taken over the last several years including equipping all of our new ships delivered during or after 2014 with advanced emissions purification aep systems covering all engines and actively developing and testing aep systems on our existing fleet we currently have in place exemptions for 19 of our ships which apply while they are sailing in the north american and caribbean ecas and for 2 of our ships that apply while they are sailing in the baltic and north seaenglish channel eca’s these exemptions have delayed the requirement to comply with the additional sulfur content reduction pending our continued development and deployment of aep systems on these ships 

we continue to implement our aep system strategy both for our ships on order and for our existing fleet as our new ships are delivered they will provide us with additional operational and deployment flexibility in addition we believe that the learning from our existing endeavors as well as our further efforts with regards to this technology will allow us to execute an effective aep system retrofit strategy for our fleet as a result we believe the cost of complying with the 2015 eca sulfur emission requirement will not be significant to our results of operations in 2016 and the years following 

by january 1 2020 the marpol regulations will require the worldwide limitations on sulfur content of fuel to be reduced from 35 to 05 while this deadline may be extended under certain circumstances andor in certain regions if such a reduced limitation is implemented worldwide or in areas in which a substantial number of our ships operate and we have not been able to successfully mitigate the impact with evolving technical solutions our fuel costs could increase significantly 

all new ships that began construction after january 1 2016 will be required to meet more stringent nitrogen oxide emission limits when operating within the north american and us caribbean sea eca we have been in the process of evaluating a number of technological alternatives over the last several years to address these new requirements and believe that we will be able to comply with these limits without a significant impact to our operations or fuel costs 

we have also taken a number of other steps to improve the overall fuel efficiency of our fleet including our new ships on order and accordingly reduce our fuel costs we continue to work to improve the efficiency of our existing fleet including improvements in operations and voyage planning as well as improvements to the propulsion machinery hvac and lighting systems the overall impact of these efforts has resulted in a 214 improvement in energy efficiency from 2005 through 2014 and we believe that our energy consumption per guest is currently the lowest in the cruise industry 

in july 2011 new marpol regulations introduced mandatory measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions these include the utilization of an energy efficiency design index eedi for new ships as well as the establishment of an energy efficient management plan for all ships the eedi is a performancebased mechanism that requires a minimum energy efficiency in new ships these regulations apply to new vessels ordered after january 1 2013 compliance with these regulations has not had nor do we expect it to have a material effect on our operating costs 

effective july 1 2015 the european commission adopted legislation that will require cruise ship operators with ships visiting ports in the european union to monitor and report on the ship’s annual carbon dioxide emissions starting in 2018 while we do not expect compliance with this regulation to materially impact our costs or results of operations the adopting legislation presents the new monitoring and reporting requirements as the first step of a staged approach which could ultimately result in additional costs or charges associated with carbon dioxide emissions 

labor regulations 

the international labour organization an agency of the united nations that develops worldwide employment standards has adopted a new consolidated maritime labour convention the “convention” which became effective in august 2013 the convention reflects a broad range of standards and conditions governing all aspects of crew management for ships in international commerce including additional requirements not previously in effect relating to the health safety repatriation entitlements and status of crew members and crew recruitment practices each of our ships required to be certified under the convention has received its certification compliance we have not incurred and do not expect to incur material costs related to ongoing compliance with the convention 

consumer financial responsibility regulations 

we are required to obtain certificates from the united states federal maritime commission relating to our ability to satisfy liability in cases of nonperformance of obligations to guests as well as casualty and personal injury as a condition to obtaining the required certificates we arrange through our insurers for the provision of surety for two of our shipoperating companies the required surety amount is currently 300 million  per operator and is subject to additional consumer price index based adjustments 

we are also required by the united kingdom norway finland and the baltics to establish our financial responsibility for any liability resulting from the nonperformance of our obligations to guests from these jurisdictions in the united kingdom we are currently required by the association of british travel agents to provide performance bonds totaling approximately £351 million  in addition in 2015 we were required by the civil aviation authority to provide performance bonds totaling approximately £119 million  the norwegian travel guarantee fund requires us to maintain performance bonds in varying amounts during the course of the year to cover our financial responsibility in norway finland and the baltics these amounts ranged from nok 30 million  to nok 105 million  during 2015  

certain other jurisdictions also require that we establish financial responsibility to our guests resulting from the nonperformance of our obligations however the related amounts do not have a material effect on our costs 

regulations regarding protection of disabled persons 

in june 2013 the us architectural and transportation barriers compliance board proposed guidelines for the construction and alteration of passenger vessels to ensure that the vessels are readily accessible to and usable by passengers with disabilities once finalized these guidelines will be used by the us department of transportation and us department of justice to implement mandatory and enforceable standards for passenger vessels covered by the americans with disabilities act while we believe our vessels have been designed and outfitted to meet the needs of our guests with disabilities we cannot at this time accurately predict whether we will be required to make material modifications or incur significant additional expenses given the preliminary status of the proposed guidelines 

taxation of the company 

the following is a summary of our principal taxes exemptions and special regimes in addition to or instead of income taxation virtually all jurisdictions where our ships call impose some tax or fee or both based on guest headcount tonnage or some other measure 

our consolidated operations are primarily foreign corporations engaged in the owning and operating of passenger cruise ships in international transportation 

us income taxation 

the following is a discussion of the application of the us federal and state income tax laws to us and is based on the current provisions of the us internal revenue code treasury department regulations administrative rulings court decisions and the relevant state tax laws regulations rulings and court decisions of the states where we have business operations all of the foregoing is subject to change and any such change could affect the accuracy of this discussion 

application of section 883 of the internal revenue code 

we and celebrity cruises inc are engaged in a trade or business in the united states and many of our shipowning subsidiaries depending upon the itineraries of their ships receive income from sources within the united states additionally our united kingdom tonnage tax company is a shipoperating company classified as a disregarded entity for us federal income tax purposes that may earn us source income under section 883 of the internal revenue code certain foreign corporations may exclude from gross income and effectively from branch profits tax as such earnings do not give rise to effectively connected earnings and profits us source income derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships including income from the leasing of such ships 

a foreign corporation will qualify for the benefits of section 883 if in relevant part 1 the foreign country in which the foreign corporation is organized grants an equivalent exemption to corporations organized in the united states and 2 the stock of the corporation or the direct or indirect corporate parent thereof is “primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market” in the united states or another qualifying country such as norway in the opinion of our united states tax counsel drinker biddle  reath llp based on the representations and assumptions set forth in that opinion we celebrity cruises inc and our shipowning subsidiaries with us source shipping income qualify for the benefits of section 883 because we and each of those subsidiaries are incorporated in liberia which is a qualifying country and our common stock is primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market in the united states or norway ie we are a publicly traded corporation if in the future 1 liberia no longer qualifies as an equivalent exemption jurisdiction and we do not reincorporate in a jurisdiction that does qualify for the exemption or 2 we fail to qualify as a publicly traded corporation we and all of our shipowning or operating subsidiaries that rely on section 883 to exclude qualifying income from gross income would be subject to us federal income tax on their us source shipping income and income from activities incidental thereto 

we believe that most of our income and the income of our shipowning subsidiaries including our uk tonnage tax company which is considered a division for us tax purposes is derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships and therefore is exempt from taxation under section 883 

regulations under section 883 list activities that are not considered by the internal revenue service to be incidental to the international operation of ships including the sale of air and land transportation shore excursions and pre and postcruise tours our income from these activities that is earned from sources within the united states will be subject to us taxation 

taxation in the absence of an exemption under section 883 

if we the operator of our vessels celebrity cruises inc or our shipowning subsidiaries were to fail to meet the requirements of section 883 of the internal revenue code or if the provision was repealed then as explained below such companies would be subject to united states income taxation on a portion of their income derived from 

or incidental to the international operation of our ships 

because we and celebrity cruises inc conduct a trade or business in the us we and celebrity cruises inc would be taxable at regular corporate rates on our separate company taxable income ie without regard to the income of our shipowning subsidiaries on income which is effectively connected with our us trade or business generally only income from us sources in addition if any of our earnings and profits effectively connected with our us trade or business were withdrawn or were deemed to have been withdrawn from our us trade or business those withdrawn amounts would be subject to a “branch profits” tax at the rate of 30 we and celebrity cruises inc would also be potentially subject to tax on portions of certain interest paid by us at rates of up to 30 

if section 883 were not available to our shipowning subsidiaries each such subsidiary would be subject to a special 4 tax on its us source gross transportation income if any each year because it does not have a fixed place of business in the united states and its income is derived from the leasing of a ship 

other united states taxation 

we and celebrity cruises inc earn united states source income from activities not considered incidental to international shipping the tax on such income is not material to our results of operation for all years presented 

state taxation 

we celebrity cruises inc and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various us state income taxes which are generally imposed on each state’s portion of the united states source income subject to federal income taxes additionally the state of alaska subjects an allocated portion of the total income of companies doing business in alaska and certain other affiliated companies to alaska corporate state income taxes and also imposes a 33 tax on adjusted gross income from onboard gambling activities conducted in alaska waters this did not have a material impact to our results of operations for all years presented 

maltese and spanish income tax 

our pullmantur ship owneroperator subsidiaries which include the owneroperator of cdf croisières de france’s ship qualify as licensed shipping organizations in malta no maltese income tax is charged on the income derived from shipping activities of a licensed shipping organization instead a licensed shipping organization is liable to pay a tax based on the net tonnage of the ship or ships registered under the relevant provisions of the merchant shipping act a company qualifies as a shipping organization if it engages in qualifying activities and it obtains a license from the registrargeneral to enable it to carry on such activities qualifying activities include but are not limited to the ownership operation under charter or otherwise administration and management of a ship or ships registered as a maltese ship in terms of the merchant shipping act and the carrying on of all ancillary financial security and commercial activities in connection therewith 

our maltese operations that do not qualify as licensed shipping organizations which are not considered significant remain subject to normal maltese corporate income tax 

pullmantur has sales and marketing functions these activities are subject to spanish taxation the tax from these operations is not considered significant to our operations 

united kingdom income tax 

we operate fourteen ships under companies which have elected to be subject to the united kingdom tonnage tax regime “uk tonnage tax” 

companies subject to uk tonnage tax pay a corporate tax on a notional profit determined with reference to the net tonnage of qualifying vessels the requirements for a company to qualify for the uk tonnage tax regime include being subject to united kingdom corporate income tax operating qualifying ships which are strategically and 

commercially managed in the united kingdom and fulfilling a seafarer training requirement 

failure to meet any of these requirements could cause us to lose the benefit of the tonnage tax regime which will have a material effect on our results of operations 

relevant shipping profits include income from the operation of qualifying ships and from shipping related activities our uk income from nonshipping activities which do not qualify under the uk tonnage tax regime and which are not considered significant remain subject to united kingdom corporate income tax 

brazilian income tax 

pullmantur and our uk tonnage tax company charters certain ships to brazilian companies for operations in brazil from november to may some of these charters are with unrelated third parties and others are with a brazilian subsidiary the brazilian subsidiary’s earnings are subject to brazilian taxation which is not considered significant the charter payments made to the uk tonnage tax company and to pullmantur are exempt from brazilian income tax under current brazilian domestic law additionally some remittances of revenue from sales of certain cruises in the brazilian market benefited from an exemption from withholding taxes that expired at the end of 2015 which will result in increased taxation for our brazilian operations 

chinese taxation 

our uk tonnage tax company operates ships in international transportation in china the income earned from this operation is exempt from taxation in china under the ukchina double tax treaty and other circulars addressing indirect taxes changes to or failure to qualify for the treaty or circular could cause us to lose the benefits provided which would have a material impact on our results of operations our chinese income from nonshipping activities or from shipping activities not qualifying for treaty or circular protection and which are considered insignificant remain subject to chinese taxation 

other taxation 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to valueadded and other indirect taxes most of which are reclaimable zerorated or exempt changes in the application or interpretation of applicable indirect tax laws or changes in tax legislation could have a material impact on our results of operations

 item 1a risk factors 

the risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k are important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historical results it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks the risks described below are only those known risks relating to our operations and financial condition that we consider material there may be additional risks that we consider not to be material or which are not known and any of these risks could have the effects set forth below   see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a cautionary note regarding forwardlooking statements 

adverse worldwide economic geopolitical or other conditions could reduce the demand for cruises and passenger spending adversely impacting our operating results cash flows and financial condition including potentially impairing the value of our ships and other assets 

the demand for cruises is affected by international national and local economic and geopolitical conditions weak or uncertain economic conditions impact consumer confidence and pose a risk as vacationers may postpone or reduce discretionary spending this in turn may result in cruise booking slowdowns decreased cruise prices and lower onboard revenues for us and for others in the cruise industry as experienced in the most recent financial crisis given the global nature of our business we are exposed to many different economies as a result gains from favorable economic conditions in certain of our markets may be offset by challenging conditions in other of our markets for example recent weakness in the economies of latin america has adversely impacted the pullmantur brand and our results of operations partially mitigating positive economic conditions in other key markets any significant deterioration of global national or local economic conditions could result in a prolonged period of booking slowdowns depressed cruise prices and reduced onboard revenues 

demand for our cruises is also influenced by geopolitical events unfavorable conditions such as crossborder conflicts civil unrest and governmental changes especially in regions with popular ports of call can undermine consumer demand andor pricing for itineraries featuring these ports 

significant or prolonged unrest and economic instability could materially adversely impact our operating results cash flows and financial condition including potentially impairing the value of our ships and other assets 

fears of terrorist and pirate attacks war and other hostilities and the spread of contagious diseases could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

events such as terrorist and pirate attacks war and other hostilities including the continued escalation of tensions in the middle east and recent global terrorism incidents and the resulting political instability travel restrictions and advisories the spread of contagious diseases such as the zika virus and concerns over safety health and security aspects of traveling or the fear of any of the foregoing have had and could have in the future a significant adverse impact on demand and pricing in the travel and vacation industry in view of our global operations we are susceptible to a wider range of adverse events 

our operating costs could increase due to market forces and economic or geopolitical factors beyond our control 

our operating costs including fuel food payroll and benefits airfare taxes insurance and security costs are all subject to increases due to market forces and economic or political conditions or other factors beyond our control increases in these operating costs could adversely affect our profitability 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates fuel costs and interest rates could affect our financial results 

we are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates fuel prices and changes in interest rates high levels of volatility with respect to any of the foregoing could have a material impact on our financial results net of the impact of our hedging activities and other natural offsets our operating results have been and will continue to be impacted often significantly by changes in each of these factors for example in 2015 the strengthening of the us dollar had a material negative impact on the value of our earnings in foreign currencies in 

addition while interest rates have been near historical lows for several years there are indications that prevailing rates may increase in 2016 as a substantial portion of our indebtedness accrues interest at a variable rate any significant increase in rates would adversely impact our operating results similarly any significant increase in fuel prices which currently are near historical lows would adversely impact our results of operations see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” and “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ” for more information 

conducting business globally may result in increased costs and other risks 

we operate our business globally operating internationally exposes us to a number of risks including increased exposure to a wider range of regional and local economic conditions volatile local political conditions potential changes in duties and taxes including changing andor uncertain interpretations of existing tax laws and regulations required compliance with additional laws and policies affecting cruising vacation or maritime businesses or governing the operations of foreignbased companies currency fluctuations interest rate movements difficulties in operating under local business environments port quality and availability in certain regions us and global antibribery laws or regulations imposition of trade barriers and restrictions on repatriation of earnings we have recently expanded our presence in china and accordingly our exposure to the risks of doing business in the country china’s economy differs from the economies of other developed countries in many respects and as the legal system in china continues to evolve there may be greater uncertainty as to the interpretation and enforcement of applicable laws and regulations 

operating globally also exposes us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal regulatory and tax requirements in many parts of the world including countries in which we operate practices in the local business communities might not conform to international business standards we must adhere to policies designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance as well as applicable laws and regulations however we might not be successful in ensuring that our employees agents representatives and other third parties with whom we associate throughout the world properly adhere to them failure by us our employees or any of these third parties to adhere to our policies or applicable laws or regulations could result in penalties sanctions damage to our reputation and related costs which in turn could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows 

if we are unable to address these risks adequately our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected including potentially impairing the value of our ships and other assets 

price increases for commercial airline service for our guests or major changes or reduction in commercial airline service andor availability could adversely impact the demand for cruises and undermine our ability to provide reasonably priced vacation packages to our guests 

many of our guests depend on scheduled commercial airline services to transport them to or from the ports where our cruises embark or disembark increases in the price of airfare would increase the overall price of the cruise vacation to our guests which may adversely impact demand for our cruises in addition changes in the availability of commercial airline services could adversely affect our guests’ ability to obtain airfare as well as our ability to fly our guests to or from our cruise ships which could adversely affect our results of operations 

incidents or adverse publicity concerning the cruise vacation industry unusual weather conditions and other natural disasters or disruptions could affect our reputation as well as impact our sales and results of operations 

the ownership andor operation of cruise ships airplanes land tours port facilities and shore excursions involves the risk of accidents illnesses mechanical failures environmental incidents and other incidents which may bring into question safety health security and vacation satisfaction which could negatively impact our reputation incidents involving cruise ships and in particular the safety and security of guests and crew and media coverage thereof have impacted and could in the future impact demand for our cruises and pricing in the industry our reputation and our business could also be damaged by negative publicity regarding the cruise industry in general including publicity regarding potentially adverse environmental impacts of cruising the considerable expansion in the use of social media and digital marketing over recent years has compounded the potential scope of any negative publicity if any such incident or news cycle occurs during a time of high seasonal demand the effect could disproportionately impact our 

results of operations for the year in addition incidents involving cruise ships may result in additional costs to our business increasing government or other regulatory oversight and in the case of incidents involving our ships potential litigation 

our cruise ships and port facilities may also be adversely impacted by unusual weather patterns or natural disasters or disruptions such as hurricanes we are often forced to alter itineraries and occasionally to cancel a cruise or a series of cruises due to these or other factors which could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability increases in the frequency severity or duration of severe weather events including from changes in the global climate could exacerbate the impact and cause further disruption to our operations in addition these and any other events which impact the travel industry more generally may negatively impact our ability to deliver guests or crew to our cruises andor interrupt our ability to obtain services and goods from key vendors in our supply chain any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and on industry performance 

an increase in capacity worldwide or excess capacity in a particular market could adversely impact our cruise sales andor pricing 

although our ships can be redeployed cruise sales andor pricing may be impacted both by the introduction of new ships into the marketplace and by deployment decisions of ourselves and our competitors a total of 44  new ships with approximately 139000  berths are on order for delivery through 2020 in the cruise industry the further growth in capacity from these new ships and future orders without an increase in the cruise industry’s share of the vacation market could depress cruise prices and impede our ability to achieve yield improvement 

in addition to the extent that we or our competitors deploy ships to a particular itinerary and the resulting capacity in that region exceeds the demand we may lower pricing and profitability may be lower than anticipated this risk may be amplified in emerging cruise markets such as china where we expect a significant increase in capacity over a relatively short time horizon any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition including potentially impairing the value of our ships and other assets 

unavailability of ports of call may adversely affect our results of operations    

we believe that port destinations are a major reason why guests choose to go on a particular cruise or on a cruise vacation the availability of ports is affected by a number of factors including existing capacity constraints constraints related to the size of certain ships security environmental and health concerns adverse weather conditions and natural disasters financial limitations on port development exclusivity arrangements that ports may have with our competitors local governmental regulations and local community concerns about port development and other adverse impacts on their communities from additional tourists in addition fuel costs may adversely impact the destinations on certain of our itineraries any limitations on the availability or feasibility of our ports of call or on the availability of shore excursion and other service providers at such ports could adversely affect our results of operations 

shipyard unavailability may adversely affect our ability to grow our business as planned and our results of operations 

we rely on shipyards to construct our new ships and to repair and upgrade our existing ships there are a limited number of shipyards with the capability and capacity to build our new ships and accordingly increased demand for available new construction slots could impact our ability to construct new ships when and as planned cause us to commit to new ship orders earlier than we have historically done so andor result in stronger bargaining power on the part of the shipyards and thus higher prices for our future ship orders our inability to timely and costeffectively procure new capacity could have a significant negative impact on our future business plans and results of operations 

in addition financial difficulties liquidations or closures suffered by shipyards andor their subcontractors may impact the timely delivery or costs of new ships or the ability of shipyards to repair and upgrade our fleet in accordance with our needs or expectations delivery delays and canceled deliveries can adversely affect our results of operations as can any constraints on our ability to build repair and maintain our ships on a timely or cost effective basis 

ship construction repair or upgrade delays or mechanical faults may result in cancellation of cruises or unscheduled drydocks and repairs and thus adversely affect our results of operations 

we depend on shipyards to construct repair and upgrade our cruise ships on a timely basis and in good working order the sophisticated nature of building a ship involves risks delays in ship construction or upgrades or mechanical faults have in the past and may in the future result in delays or cancellation of cruises or necessitate unscheduled drydocks and repairs of ships these events and any related adverse publicity could result in lost revenue increased operating expenses or both and thus adversely affect our results of operations 

we may lose business to competitors throughout the vacation market    

we operate in the vacation market and cruising is one of many alternatives for people choosing a vacation we therefore risk losing business not only to other cruise lines but also to other vacation operators which provide other leisure options including hotels resorts and package holidays and tours 

we face significant competition from other cruise lines on the basis of cruise pricing travel agent preference and also in terms of the nature of ships and services we offer to guests our principal competitors within the cruise vacation industry include carnival corporation  plc which owns among others aida cruises carnival cruise line costa cruises cunard line holland america line po cruises and princess cruises disney cruise line msc cruises norwegian cruise line holdings ltd which owns norwegian cruise line oceania cruises and regent seven seas cruises 

in the event that we do not differentiate our cruise brands from our competitors or otherwise compete effectively with other vacation alternatives and new or existing cruise companies our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

we may not be able to obtain sufficient financing or capital for our needs or may not be able to do so on terms that are acceptable or consistent with our expectations 

to fund our capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments we have historically relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations drawdowns under available credit facilities the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the sale of equity or debt securities in private or public securities markets any circumstance or event which leads to a decrease in consumer cruise spending such as worsening global economic conditions or significant incidents impacting the cruise industry could negatively affect our operating cash flows see “ adverse worldwide economic geopolitical or other conditions… ” and “ incidents or adverse publicity concerning the cruise vacation industry…” for more information 

although we believe we can access sufficient liquidity to fund our operations and obligations as expected there can be no assurances to that effect our ability to access additional funding as and when needed our ability to timely refinance andor replace our outstanding debt securities and credit facilities on acceptable terms and our cost of funding will depend upon numerous factors including but not limited to the vibrancy of the financial markets our financial performance and the performance of our industry in general in addition even where financing commitments have been secured significant disruptions in the capital and credit markets could cause our banking and other counterparties to breach their contractual obligations to us this could include failures of banks or other financial service companies to fund required borrowings under our loan agreements or to pay us amounts that may become due under our derivative contracts for hedging of fuel prices interest rates and foreign currencies or other agreements if any of the foregoing occurs it may have a negative impact on our cash flows including our ability to meet our obligations our results of operations and our financial condition 

our inability to satisfy the covenants required by our credit facilities could adversely impact our liquidity 

our debt agreements contain covenants including covenants restricting our ability to take certain actions and financial covenants in addition our ability to make borrowings under our available credit facilities is subject to the absence of material adverse changes in our business our ability to maintain our credit facilities may also be impacted 

by changes in our ownership base more specifically we may be required to prepay our ship financing facilities if i any person or entity other than a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates and their respective affiliates the “applicable group” acquires ownership of more than 33 of our common stock and the applicable group owns less of our common stock than such person or ii subject to certain exceptions during any 24month period a majority of the board is no longer comprised of individuals who were members of the board on the first day of such period our other debt agreements also contain change of control provisions that would be triggered by the acquisition of greater than 50 of our common stock by i any person or ii in the case of our public debt securities a person other than a member of the applicable group coupled with a ratings downgrade 

our failure to comply with the terms of our debt facilities could result in an event of default generally if an event of default under any debt agreement occurs then pursuant to cross default acceleration clauses our outstanding debt and derivative contract payables could become due andor terminated in addition in such events our credit card processors could hold back payments to create a reserve we cannot provide assurances that we would have sufficient liquidity to repay or the ability to refinance the borrowings under any of the credit facilities or settle other outstanding contracts if such amounts were accelerated upon an event of default 

if we are unable to appropriately balance our cost management and capital allocation strategies with our goal of satisfying guest expectations it may adversely impact our business success 

our goals call for us to provide high quality products and deliver high quality services there can be no assurance that we can successfully balance these goals with our cost management and capital allocation strategies our business also requires us to make capital allocation decisions such as ordering new ships andor upgrading our ships based on expected market preferences and projected demand there can be no assurance that our strategies will be successful which could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

our attempts to expand our business into new markets and new ventures may not be successful 

we opportunistically seek to grow our business through among other things expansion into new destination or source markets and establishment of new ventures complementary to our current offerings these attempts to expand our business increase the complexity of our business require significant levels of investment and can strain our management personnel operations and systems there can be no assurance that these business expansion efforts will develop as anticipated or that we will succeed and if we do not we may be unable to recover our investment which could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

our reliance on travel agencies to sell and market our cruises exposes us to certain risks which if realized could adversely impact our business 

we rely on travel agencies to generate the majority of bookings for our ships accordingly we must ensure that our commission rates and incentive structures remain competitive if we fail to offer competitive compensation packages these agencies may be incentivized to sell cruises offered by our competitors to our detriment which could adversely impact our operating results our reliance on thirdparty sellers is particularly pronounced in certain markets such as china where we have a large number of travel agent charter and group sales and less retail agency and direct booking refer to cruise pricing  under item 1 business for further information on the china business model in addition the travel agent industry is sensitive to economic conditions that impact discretionary income significant disruptions especially disruptions impacting those agencies that sell a high volume of our business or contractions in the industry could reduce the number of travel agencies available for us to market and sell our cruises which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

disruptions in our shoreside operations or our information systems may adversely affect our results of operations 

our principal executive office and principal shoreside operations are located at the port of miami florida and we have shoreside offices throughout the world actual or threatened natural disasters eg hurricanes earthquakes tornadoes fires floods or similar events in these locations may have a material impact on our business continuity reputation and results of operations in addition substantial or repeated information systems failures computer viruses 

or cyberattacks impacting our shoreside or shipboard operations could adversely impact our business we do not generally carry business interruption insurance for our shoreside operations or our information systems as such any losses or damages incurred by us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

the loss of key personnel our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel or disruptions among our shipboard personnel due to strained employee relations could adversely affect our results of operations 

our success depends in large part on the skills and contributions of key executives and other employees and on our ability to recruit and retain high quality personnel in key markets we must continue to sufficiently recruit retain train and motivate our employees to maintain our current business and support our projected global growth both shoreside and on our ships furthermore as of december 31 2015 83  of our shipboard employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements a dispute under our collective bargaining agreements could result in a work stoppage of those employees covered by the agreements a loss of key employees our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel or disruptions among our personnel could adversely affect our results of operations 

business activities that involve our coinvestment with third parties may subject us to additional risks 

partnerships joint ventures and other business structures involving our coinvestment with third parties such as our joint venture to operate tui cruises our partnership to operate skysea cruises our investment in grand bahama shipyard and our minority ownership investments in various port development and other projects generally include some form of shared control over the operations of the business and create additional risks including the possibility that other investors in such ventures could become bankrupt or otherwise lack the financial resources to meet their obligations or could have or develop business interests policies or objectives that are inconsistent with ours in addition actions by another investor may present additional risks of operational difficulties or reputational or legal concerns these or other issues related to our coinvestment with third parties could adversely impact our operations 

we rely on thirdparty providers of various services integral to the operations of our businesses these third parties may act in ways that could harm our business 

in order to achieve cost and operational efficiencies we outsource to thirdparty vendors certain services that are integral to the operations of our global businesses such as our onboard concessionaires certain of our call center operations and operation of a large part of our information technology systems we are subject to the risk that certain decisions are subject to the control of our thirdparty service providers and that these decisions may adversely affect our activities a failure to adequately monitor a thirdparty service provider’s compliance with a service level agreement or regulatory or legal requirements could result in significant economic and reputational harm to us there is also a risk the confidentiality privacy andor security of data held by third parties or communicated over thirdparty networks or platforms could become compromised 

a failure to keep pace with developments in technology or technological obsolescence could impair our operations or competitive position 

our business continues to demand the use of sophisticated technology and systems these technologies and systems must be refined updated andor replaced with more advanced systems in order to continue to meet our customers’ demands and expectations if we are unable to do so in a timely manner or within reasonable cost parameters or if we are unable to appropriately and timely train our employees to operate any of these new systems our business could suffer we also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new technology or system and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could impair our operating results 

we may be exposed to risks and costs associated with cyber security including protecting the integrity and security of our guests’ employees’ and business partners’ personal information 

we are subject to various risks associated with the collection handling storage and transmission of sensitive information including risks related to compliance with applicable laws and other contractual obligations as well as the risk that our systems collecting such information could be compromised in the course of doing business we collect 

large volumes of internal and customer data including personally identifiable information for various business purposes we are subject to federal state and international laws relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of personally identifiable information in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between the company and its subsidiaries and among the company its subsidiaries and other parties with which the company has commercial relations several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices if we fail to comply with the various applicable data collection and privacy laws we could be exposed to fines penalties restrictions litigation or other expenses and our business could be adversely impacted 

in addition even if we are fully compliant with legal standards and contractual requirements we still may not be able to prevent security breaches involving sensitive data any breach theft loss or fraudulent use of guest employee or company data could adversely impact our reputation and brand and our ability to retain or attract new customers and expose us to risks of data loss business disruption governmental investigation litigation and other liability any of which could adversely affect our business significant capital investments and other expenditures could be required to remedy the problem and prevent future breaches including costs associated with additional security technologies personnel experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached additionally the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyberattacks and breaches of information technology systems as well as the sources and targets of these attacks change frequently and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time our security measures cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breaches 

environmental labor health and safety financial responsibility and other maritime regulations could affect operations and increase operating costs 

the united states and various state and foreign government or regulatory agencies have enacted or are considering new environmental regulations or policies such as requiring the use of low sulfur fuels increasing fuel efficiency requirements further restricting emissions or other initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions that could increase our direct cost to operate in certain markets increase our cost for fuel limit the supply of compliant fuel cause us to incur significant expenses to purchase andor develop new equipment and adversely impact the cruise vacation industry while we have taken and expect to continue to take a number of actions to mitigate the potential impact of certain of these regulations there can be no assurances that these efforts will be successful or completed on a timely basis some environmental groups have also lobbied for more stringent regulation of cruise ships and have generated negative publicity about the cruise vacation industry and its environmental impact see item 1 businessregulationenvironmental regulations  an increase in fuel prices not only impacts our fuel costs but also some of our other expenses such as crew travel freight and commodity prices 

in addition we are subject to various international national state and local laws regulations and treaties that govern among other things safety standards applicable to our ships treatment of disabled persons health and sanitary standards applicable to our guests security standards on board our ships and at the shipport interface areas and financial responsibilities to our guests these issues are and we believe will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world this could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise ships that could subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 

a change in our tax status under the united states internal revenue code or other jurisdictions may have adverse effects on our income  

we and a number of our subsidiaries are foreign corporations that derive income from a us trade or business andor from sources within the us drinker biddle  reath llp our united states tax counsel has delivered to us an opinion based on certain representations and assumptions set forth in it to the effect that this income to the extent derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships is excluded from gross income us federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 883 of the internal revenue code we believe that most of our income including that of our subsidiaries is derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships 

our ability to rely on section 883 could change in the future provisions of the internal revenue code including section 883 are subject to legislative change at any time moreover changes could occur in the future with respect to the identity residence or holdings of our direct or indirect shareholders trading volume or trading frequency of our shares or relevant foreign tax laws of liberia such that they no longer qualify as equivalent exemption jurisdictions that could affect our eligibility for the section 883 exemption accordingly there can be no assurance that we will continue to be exempt from us income tax on us source shipping income in the future if we were not entitled to the benefit of section 883 we and our subsidiaries would be subject to us taxation on a portion of the income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships which would reduce our net income 

additionally portions of our business are operated by companies that are within tonnage tax regimes of the uk and malta further some of the operations of these companies are conducted in jurisdictions where we rely on tax treaties to provide exemption from taxation to the extent the tonnage tax laws of these countries change or we do not continue to meet the applicable qualification requirements or if tax treaties are changed or revoked we may be required to pay higher income tax in these jurisdictions adversely impacting our results of operations 

as budgetary constraints continue to adversely impact the jurisdictions in which we operate increases in income tax regulations or tax reform affecting our operations may be imposed 

litigation enforcement actions fines or penalties could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations andor damage our reputation 

our business is subject to various united states and international laws and regulations that could lead to enforcement actions fines civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims and damages in addition improper conduct by our employees agents or joint venture partners could damage our reputation andor lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties including substantial monetary fines in certain circumstances it may not be economical to defend against such matters andor a legal strategy may not ultimately result in us prevailing in a matter such events could lead to an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

we are not a united states corporation and our shareholders may be subject to the uncertainties of a foreign legal system in protecting their interests 

our corporate affairs are governed by our articles of incorporation and bylaws and by the business corporation act of liberia the provisions of the business corporation act of liberia resemble provisions of the corporation laws of a number of states in the united states however while most states have a fairly well developed body of case law interpreting their respective corporate statutes there are very few judicial cases in liberia interpreting the business corporation act of liberia as such the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under liberian law are not as clearly established as the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in certain united states jurisdictions for example the right of shareholders to bring a derivative action in liberian courts may be more limited than in united states jurisdictions there may also be practical difficulties for shareholders attempting to bring suit in liberia and liberian courts may or may not recognize and enforce foreign judgments thus our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests with respect to actions by management directors or controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a united states jurisdiction 

provisions of our articles of incorporation bylaws and liberian law could inhibit others from acquiring us prevent a change of control and may prevent efforts by our shareholders to change our management 

certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and liberian law may inhibit third parties from effectuating a change of control of the company without board approval which could result in the entrenchment of current management these include provisions in our articles of incorporation that prevent third parties other than a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates from acquiring beneficial ownership of more than 49 of our outstanding shares without the consent of our board of directors

 item 3 legal proceedings 

a c lass action complaint was filed in june 2011 against royal caribbean cruises ltd in the united states district court for the southern district of florida on behalf of a purported class of stateroom attendants employed onboard royal caribbean international cruise vessels the complaint alleged that the stateroom attendants were required to pay other crew members to help with their duties and that certain stateroom attendants were required to work back of house assignments without the ability to earn gratuities in each case in violation of the us seaman’s wage act in may 2012 the district court granted our motion to dismiss the complaint on the basis that the applicable collective bargaining agreement requires any such claims to be arbitrated the united states court of appeals 11th circuit affirmed the district court’s dismissal and denied the plaintiffs’ petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc in october 2014 the united states supreme court denied the plaintiffs’ request to review the order compelling arbitration subsequently approximately 575  crew members submitted demands for arbitration the demands make substantially the same allegations as in the federal court complaint and are similarly seeking damages wage penalties and interest in an indeterminate amount unlike the federal court complaint the demands for arbitration are being brought individually by each of the crew members and not on behalf of a purported class of stateroom attendants in february 2016 we settled this matter as to all demanding crew members in exchange for our payment in the aggregate of an immaterial amount the settlement is subject to finalization of all settlement documents 

in april 2015 the alaska department of environmental conservation issued notices of violation to royal caribbean international and celebrity cruises seeking monetary penalties for alleged violations of the alaska marine visible emission standards that occurred over the past five years on certain of our vessels we believe we have meritorious defenses to the allegations and we are cooperating with the state of alaska we do not believe that the ultimate outcome of these claims will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations and cash flows 

we are routinely involved in other claims typical within the cruise vacation industry the majority of these claims are covered by insurance we believe the outcome of such claims net of expected insurance recoveries will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations and cash flows

overview 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations have been organized to present the following 

 critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap refer to note 1 general  and note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  certain of our accounting policies are deemed critical as they require managements highest degree of judgment estimates and assumptions we have discussed these accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors we believe our most critical accounting policies are as follows 

ship accounting 

our ships represent our most significant assets and are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization depreciation of ships is generally computed net of a 15 projected residual value using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of the asset which is generally 30 years the 30year useful life of our newly constructed ships and 15 associated residual value are both based on the weightedaverage of all major components 

of a ship our useful life and residual value estimates take into consideration the impact of anticipated technological changes longterm cruise and vacation market conditions and historical useful lives of similarlybuilt ships in addition we take into consideration our estimates of the weightedaverage useful lives of the ships major component systems such as hull superstructure main electric engines and cabins given the very large and complex nature of our ships our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain we do not have cost segregation studies performed to specifically componentize our ship systems therefore we estimate the costs of component systems based principally on general and technical information known about major ship component systems and their lives and our knowledge of the cruise vacation industry we do not identify and track depreciation by ship component systems but instead utilize these estimates to determine the net cost basis of assets replaced or refurbished improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized as additions to the ship and depreciated over the shorter of the improvements estimated useful lives or that of the associated ship the estimated cost and accumulated depreciation of replaced or refurbished ship components are written off and any resulting losses are recognized in cruise operating expenses  

we use the deferral method to account for drydocking costs under the deferral method drydocking costs incurred are deferred and charged to expense on a straightline basis over the period to the next scheduled drydock which we estimate to be a period of thirty to sixty months based on the vessels age as required by class deferred drydock costs consist of the costs to drydock the vessel and other costs incurred in connection with the drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessels class certification class certification is necessary in order for our cruise ships to be flagged in a specific country obtain liability insurance and legally operate as passenger cruise ships the activities associated with those drydocking costs cannot be performed while the vessel is in service and as such are done during a drydock as a planned major maintenance activity the significant deferred drydock costs consist of hauling and wharfage services provided by the drydock facility hull inspection and related activities eg scraping pressure cleaning bottom painting maintenance to steering propulsion thruster equipment and ballast tanks port services such as tugs pilotage and line handling and freight associated with these items we perform a detailed analysis of the various activities performed for each drydock and only defer those costs that are directly related to planned major maintenance activities necessary to maintain class the costs deferred are related to activities not otherwise routinely periodically performed to maintain a vessels designed and intended operating capability repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred 

we use judgment when estimating the period between drydocks which can result in adjustments to the estimated amortization of drydock costs if the vessel is disposed of before the next drydock the remaining balance in deferred drydock is writtenoff to the gain or loss upon disposal of vessel in the period in which the sale takes place we also use judgment when identifying costs incurred during a drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessels class certification as compared to those costs attributable to repairs and maintenance which are expensed as incurred 

we believe we have made reasonable estimates for ship accounting purposes however should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimates of ship useful lives or projected residual values depreciation expense could be materially higher or lower if circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making determinations as to whether ship improvements should be capitalized the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance costs could increase partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense if we had reduced our estimated average ship useful life by one year depreciation expense for 2015  would have increased by approximately 667 million  if our ships were estimated to have no residual value depreciation expense for 2015  would have increased by approximately 1888 million  

valuation of goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets and longlived assets 

we review goodwill trademarks and trade names which are our most significant indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or when events or circumstances dictate more frequently the impairment review for goodwill consists of a qualitative assessment of whether it is morelikelythannot that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount and if necessary a twostep goodwill impairment test factors to consider when performing the qualitative assessment include general economic conditions limitations on accessing capital changes in forecasted operating results changes in fuel prices and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates if the qualitative assessment demonstrates that it is morelikelythannot that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value it is not necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test we may elect to 

bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to step one for any reporting unit in any period on a periodic basis we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed to step one to corroborate the results of recent years qualitative assessments we can resume the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any subsequent period 

when performing the twostep goodwill impairment test the fair value of the reporting unit is determined and compared to the carrying value of the net assets allocated to the reporting unit we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a probabilityweighted discounted cash flow model the estimation of fair value utilizing discounted expected future cash flows includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of expected revenues operating costs marketing selling and administrative expenses interest rates ship additions and retirements as well as assumptions regarding the cruise vacation industrys competitive environment and general economic and business conditions among other factors the principal assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model are projected operating results weightedaverage cost of capital and terminal value the discounted cash flow model uses our 2016  projected operating results as a base to that base we add future years cash flows assuming multiple revenue and expense scenarios that reflect the impact of different global economic environments beyond 2016  on the reporting unit we discount the projected cash flows using rates specific to the reporting unit based on its weightedaverage cost of capital if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value no further analysis or writedown of goodwill is required if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of its net assets the implied fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all its underlying assets and liabilities including both recognized and unrecognized tangible and intangible assets based on their fair value if necessary goodwill is then written down to its implied fair value 

the impairment review for indefinitelife intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount we estimate the fair value of our indefinitelife intangible assets which consist of trademarks and trade names related to pullmantur using a discounted cash flow model and the relieffromroyalty method the royalty rate used is based on comparable royalty agreements in the tourism and hospitality industry the discount rate used is comparable to the rate used in valuing the pullmantur reporting unit in our goodwill impairment test if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess if the fair value exceeds its carrying amount the indefinitelife intangible asset is not considered impaired other intangible assets assigned finite useful lives are amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives 

we review our ships aircraft and other longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable we evaluate asset impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities the lowest level for which we maintain identifiable cash flows that are independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities is at the ship level for our ships and at the aggregated asset group level for our aircraft if estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of an asset an impairment charge is recognized to the extent its carrying value exceeds fair value 

we estimate fair value based on quoted market prices in active markets if available if active markets are not available we base fair value on independent appraisals sales price negotiations and projected future cash flows discounted at a rate estimated by management to be commensurate with the business risk quoted market prices are often not available for individual reporting units and for indefinitelife intangible assets accordingly we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit and an indefinitelife intangible asset using an expected present value technique 

2015 impairment of pullmantur related assets 

pullmantur is a brand that historically targeted primarily the spanish and latin american markets these markets have experienced significant volatility and the brand has adopted various changes to its operating strategy as a result most recently in response to favorable economic expectations in latin america especially brazil management undertook a positioning of the brand to increase sourcing of guests and to deliver deployment for latin american consumers transferring newer and more efficient capacity to the brand and selling pullmantur’s noncore businesses to allow the brand to focus on the core cruise business 

however the latin american resurgence was short lived and the core latin american economies including brazil mexico argentina and venezuela have regressed and their currencies have materially depreciated versus the 

us dollar most notably the brazilian real devalued by approximately 22 relative to the us dollar during the third quarter of 2015 

in light of the increased challenges facing pullmantur’s latin american strategy we made a decision to significantly change that strategy from growing the brand through vessel transfers to a rightsizing strategy during the third quarter of 2015 this rightsizing strategy includes reducing our exposure to latin america refocusing on the brand’s core market of spain and consequently reducing the size of pullmantur’s fleet this strategic change includes a decision to redeploy pullmantur’s empress  to the royal caribbean international brand as well as a decision to cancel the intended transfer of the majesty of the seas  to pullmantur as we previously disclosed the planned growth of the pullmantur fleet through the transfer of vessels into the brand has been the most significant assumption within pullmanturs projected cash flows supporting the recoverability of the pullmantur reporting unit’s goodwill and trademarks and trade names our decision to reduce the size of pullmantur’s fleet significantly decreases the cash flow projections which have been the basis of our impairment analysis 

 as a result of these developments we performed an interim impairment evaluation of pullmantur’s goodwill and trademarks and trade names in connection with the preparation of our financial statements during the quarter ended september 30 2015 

due to the previously described market conditions and our recent decision to reduce our exposure to latin america refocus on the brand’s core spanish market and reduce the brands overall capacity we reviewed the twostep goodwill impairment test based on the updated cash flow projections as a result of this analysis we determined that the carrying value of the pullmantur reporting unit exceeded its fair value similarly we determined that the carrying value of pullmantur’s trademarks and trade names exceeded their fair value as well accordingly upon the completion of the twostep impairment test we recognized impairment charges of 1238 million and 1743 million for goodwill and trademark and trade names respectively during the quarter ended september 30 2015 these charges reflected the full carrying amounts of the goodwill and trademark and trade names leaving pullmantur with no intangible assets on its books 

additionally in conjunction with performing the twostep goodwill impairment test we identified that the estimated fair value of certain longlived assets consisting of two ships and three aircraft were less than their carrying values as a result of this determination we evaluated these assets pursuant to our longlived asset impairment test the decision to significantly reduce our exposure to the latin american market negatively impacted the expected undiscounted cash flows of these vessels and aircraft and resulted in an impairment charge of 1132 million to write down these assets to their estimated fair values during the quarter ended september 30 2015 

the combined impairment charge of 4113 million related to pullmantur’s goodwill trademarks and trade names vessels and aircraft was recognized in earnings during the quarter ended september 30 2015 and is reported within impairment of pullmantur related assets in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss 

royal caribbean international 

during the fourth quarter of 2015 we performed our annual impairment review of goodwill for the royal caribbean international reporting unit we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceeded directly to step one of the twostep goodwill impairment test to corroborate the results of recent years qualitative assessments as a result of the test we determined the fair value of the royal caribbean international reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 90  resulting in no impairment to royal caribbean international goodwill as of december 31 2015 the carrying amount of goodwill attributable to our royal caribbean international reporting unit was 2868 million

we enter into various forward swap and option contracts to manage our interest rate exposure and to limit our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices these instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value and the vast majority are designated as hedges we also use nonderivative financial instruments designated as hedges of our net investment in our foreign operations and investments the fuel options we entered into represent economic hedges which were not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes and thus changes in their fair value were immediately recognized in earnings although certain of our derivative 

financial instruments do not qualify or are not accounted for under hedge accounting we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes we account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with authoritative guidance refer to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  and note 14 fair value measurements and derivative instruments  to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for more information on related authoritative guidance the companys hedging programs and derivative financial instruments 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and collars interest rate crosscurrency and fuel swaps and options with thirdparty institutions in overthecounter markets we estimate the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate and crosscurrency swaps using expected future cash flows based on the instruments contract terms and published forward prices for foreign currency exchange and interest rates we apply present value techniques and liborbased discount rates to convert the expected future cash flows to the current fair value of the instruments 

we estimate the fair value of our foreign currency collars using standard option pricing models with inputs based on the options contract terms such as exercise price and maturity and readily available public market data such as foreign exchange prices foreign exchange volatility levels and discount rates 

we estimate the fair value of our fuel swaps using expected future cash flows based on the swaps contract terms and forward prices we derive forward prices from forward fuel curves based on pricing inputs provided by thirdparty institutions that transact in the fuel indices we hedge we validate these pricing inputs against actual market transactions and published price quotes for similar assets we apply present value techniques and liborbased discount rates to convert the expected future cash flows to the current fair value of the instruments we also corroborate our fair value estimates using valuations provided by our counterparties 

we estimate the fair value for our fuel call options based on the prevailing market price for the instruments consisting of published price quotes for similar assets based on recent transactions in an active market 

we adjust the valuation of our derivative financial instruments to incorporate credit risk 

we believe it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate crosscurrency and fuel swaps and options would be derived from other appropriate valuation models using similar assumptions inputs or conditions suggested by actual historical experience 

contingencies—litigation 

on an ongoing basis we assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss if any can be made in assessing probable losses we take into consideration estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries if any which are recorded as assets when recoverability is probable we accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recoveries it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made 

seasonality 

our revenues are seasonal based on demand for cruises demand is strongest for cruises during the northern hemispheres summer months and holidays in order to mitigate the impact of the winter weather in the northern hemisphere and to capitalize on the summer season in the southern hemisphere our brands have focused on deployment to the caribbean asia and australia during that period 

financial presentation 

description of certain line items 

revenues 

our revenues are comprised of the following 

 cruise operating expenses 

our cruise operating expenses are comprised of the following 

 we do not allocate payroll and related expenses food expenses fuel expenses or other operating expenses to the expense categories attributable to passenger ticket revenues or onboard and other revenues since they are incurred to provide the total cruise vacation experience 

selected operational and financial metrics 

we utilize a variety of operational and financial metrics which are defined below to evaluate our performance and financial condition as discussed in more detail herein certain of these metrics are nongaap financial measures which we believe provide useful information to investors as a supplement to our consolidated financial statements which are prepared and presented in accordance with gaap the presentation of nongaap financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap 

adjusted earnings per share  represents adjusted net income divided by weighted average shares outstanding or by diluted weighted average shares outstanding as applicable we believe that this nongaap measure is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis 

adjusted net income  represents net income excluding certain items that we believe adjusting for is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis for the periods presented these items included the impairment of the pullmantur related assets restructuring and related impairment charges other costs related to our profitability initiatives the estimated impact of the divested pullmantur noncore businesses for periods prior to the sales transaction the loss recognized on the sale of celebrity century the impact of the change in our voyage proration methodology and the reversal of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance due to spanish tax reform the estimated impact of the divested pullmantur noncore businesses was arrived at by adjusting the net income loss of these businesses for the ownership percentage we retained as well as for intercompany transactions that are no longer eliminated in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss subsequent to the sales transaction for the full year 2014 the impact of the voyage proration change represents net income that would have been recognized in 2013 had we recognized revenues and cruise operating expenses on a prorata basis for all voyages 

available passenger cruise days  apcd is our measurement of capacity and represents double occupancy per cabin multiplied by the number of cruise days for the period we use this measure to perform capacity and rate analysis to identify our main noncapacity drivers that cause our cruise revenue and expenses to vary 

gross cruise costs  represent the sum of total cruise operating expenses plus marketing selling and administrative expenses 

gross yields  represent total revenues per apcd 

net cruise costs  and net cruise costs excluding fuel  represent gross cruise costs excluding commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses and in the case of net cruise costs excluding fuel fuel expenses each of which is described above under the description of certain line items  heading in measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income we believe changes in net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance a reconciliation of historical gross cruise costs to net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel is provided below under results of operations  we have not provided a quantitative reconciliation of projected gross cruise costs to projected net cruise costs and projected net cruise costs excluding fuel due to the significant uncertainty in projecting the costs deducted to arrive at these measures accordingly we do not believe that reconciling information for such projected figures would be meaningful for the periods prior to the sale of the pullmantur noncore businesses net cruise costs excludes the estimated impact of these divested businesses net cruise costs also excludes initiative costs reported within cruise operating expenses  and marketing selling and administrative expenses  as well as the loss recognized on the sale of celebrity century  included within other operating expenses  

net revenues represent total revenues less commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses each of which is described above under the description of certain line items  heading for the periods prior to the sale of the pullmantur noncore businesses we have presented net revenues excluding the estimated impact of these divested businesses in the financial tables under results of operations  

net yields  represent net revenues per apcd we utilize net revenues and net yields to manage our business on a daytoday basis as we believe that it is the most relevant measure of our pricing performance because it reflects the cruise revenues earned by us net of our most significant variable costs which are commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses a reconciliation of historical gross yields to net yields is provided 

below under results of operations  we have not provided a quantitative reconciliation of projected gross yields to projected net yields due to the significant uncertainty in projecting the costs deducted to arrive at this measure accordingly we do not believe that reconciling information for such projected figures would be meaningful for the periods prior to the sale of the pullmantur noncore businesses net yields excludes the estimated impact of these divested businesses 

occupancy  in accordance with cruise vacation industry practice is calculated by dividing passenger cruise days by apcd a percentage in excess of 100 indicates that three or more passengers occupied some cabins 

passenger cruise days  represent the number of passengers carried for the period multiplied by the number of days of their respective cruises 

we believe net yields net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel are our most relevant nongaap financial measures however a significant portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar because our reporting currency is the united states dollar the value of these revenues and expenses can be affected by changes in currency exchange rates although such changes in local currency prices is just one of many elements impacting our revenues and expenses it can be an important element for this reason we also monitor net yields net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel as if the current periods currency exchange rates had remained constant with the comparable prior periods rates or on a constant currency basis 

it should be emphasized that constant currency is primarily used for comparing shortterm changes andor projections changes in guest sourcing and shifting the amount of purchases between currencies can change the impact of the purely currencybased fluctuations 

the use of certain significant nongaap measures such as net yields net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel allows us to perform capacity and rate analysis to separate the impact of known capacity changes from other less predictable changes which affect our business we believe these nongaap measures provide expanded insight to measure revenue and cost performance in addition to the standard united states gaap based financial measures there are no specific rules or regulations for determining nongaap and constant currency measures and as such there exists the possibility that they may not be comparable to other companies within the industry 

executive overview 

the year 2015 marked the second year of our four year doubledouble program doubledouble and we remain on track to accomplish our goal of doubling 2014 adjusted earnings per share and achieving doubledigit return on invested capital by 2017 the company’s long term commitment to grow revenue yields manage costs and maintain steady capacity growth continues to guide us towards doubledouble 

our 2015 net income was 6658 million  or 302  per diluted share compared to 7641 million or 343 per diluted share in 2014 net income for 2015 includes a noncash impairment charge of 3993 million related to pullmantur’s intangible assets and certain longlived assets adjusted net income for 2015 was 11 billion  or 483  per diluted share compared to 7557 million or 339 per diluted share in 2014 the year 2015 was another record year for our company as adjusted earnings grew by more than 40 yearoveryear for the second consecutive year additionally constant currency net yields increased for the sixth consecutive year 

the company grew 2015 net yields by 35  on a constantcurrency basis mainly due to the increase in passenger ticket revenues the delivery of quantum of the seas in late 2014 and her move to china in june 2015 generated record ticket and onboard yields china was one of our highest yielding products in 2015 despite considerable industry capacity growth the mers outbreak in south korea and several typhoons european itineraries also proved to be resilient in spite of the politcal instability in greece turkey and northern africa the caribbean began to see improved demand and a more favorable pricing environment beginning in the spring of 2015 in particular peak summer pricing for caribbean itineraries was particularly strong on the other hand the latin american market has experienced significant volatility and the currencies of the core latin american economies have materially depreciated versus the us dollar negatively impacting our results of operations 

the world’s currencies weakening relative to the us dollar had an unfavorable impact on the value of our earnings in foreign currencies and negatively impacted onboard spending for our international markets except for the asian market where quantum of the seas  had record setting onboard revenue yields in the summer of 2015 as we head into 2016 we continue to focus on our beverage packages specialty restaurants internet packages and shore excursions to strengthen our onboard yields 

we remain dedicated to finding efficiencies identifying synergies and improving costs while at the same time focusing on strategic spending by investing in areas that will boost revenue in 2015 our net cruise costs excluding fuel declined 06 for the year compared to 2014 going into 2016 we expect that nonfuel costs will be up slightly for the year as we strategically focus on increasing customerfacing venues and revenue generating technologies spending ‘smart’ marketing dollars growing our business in china and growing our direct business 

due to the weakness in latin america described above during the third quarter of 2015 we made a decision to significantly change our pullmantur strategy from growing the brand through vessel transfers to a rightsizing strategy this rightsizing strategy includes reducing our exposure to latin america refocusing on the brand’s core market of spain and reducing the size of pullmantur’s fleet consequently our change in strategy led to a noncash impairment charge of 3993 million  net of a 120 million deferred tax benefit during the third quarter of 2015 primarily related to its goodwill its trademark and trade names and a reduction in the carrying value of select vessels in the pullmantur fleet 

the company remains focused on improving returns for our shareholders in september 2015 we announced a 25 dividend increase followed by our announcement in october 2015 of a 500 million stock repurchase program including a 200 million accelerated stock repurchase that was completed in november 2015 

for the year 2016 we expect our caribbean capacity will be up slightly due in part to the introduction of a yearround quantumclass ship in the northeast which will augment our two yearround oasisclass ships in south florida we expect capacity in europe will be up 4 yearoveryear for the company as we intend to make a few hardware changes including the debut of  harmony of the seas in the second quarter of 2016 the asia pacific region 

is expected to have a 33 increase in capacity yearoveryear primarily due to the debut of ovation of the seas  expected in april 2016 we intend to have nine ships in the region in 2016 compared to eight ships in 2015 

additionally we ordered our fourth and fifth royal caribbean international quantumclass ships for delivery in 2019 and 2020 respectively and expect delivery of celebrity’s two new project edge ships and royal caribbean internationals fourth oasisclass ship in 2018 2020 and 2018 respectively 

in addition to investing in new hardware we opportunistically evaluate selling or transferring older ships to further optimize our fleet since 2014 we have engaged in three transactions that are expected to improve our return on invested capital  the sale of celebrity   century  to a subsidiary of skysea holding the sale of ocean dream  to an unrelated third party and the pending sale of splendour of the seas to tui cruises

liquidity and capital resources 

sources and uses of cash   

cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity net cash provided by operating activities increased 2026 million  to 19 billion  for 2015  compared to 17 billion  for 2014  the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to a 1294 million increase in cash receipts from customer deposits a 663 million increase in cash receipts from onboard spending and a decrease in fuel costs and interest paid in 2015  compared to the same period in 2014 

net cash provided by operating activities increased 3317 million to 17 billion for 2014 compared to 14 billion for 2013 the increase was primarily due to a decrease in interest paid in 2014 compared to 2013 and the timing of proceeds from accounts receivable and payments to vendors in 2014

net cash used in financing activities was 2535 million  for 2015  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of   175 million  in 2014  this change was primarily due to an increase of 3943 million in repayment of debt an increase of dividends paid of 813 million  and a decrease in the proceeds from the exercise of common stock options of 596 million  the increase in cash used in financing activities is partially offset by a 2455 million  increase in debt proceeds and a 361 million decrease in the repurchase of treasury stock the increase in repayment of debt was due to higher payments of 11 billion on our revolving credit facilities and a payment at maturity of 2790 million on our 11875 unsecured senior notes during 2015 compared to the payment at maturity of our €7450 million 5625 unsecured senior notes during 2014 the increase in debt proceeds was primarily due to the 7421 million  unsecured term loan borrowed to finance the purchase of anthem of the seas and higher drawings of 7060 million on our revolving credit facilities in 2015 compared to proceeds received on an unsecured term loan of 7911 million due to 

the delivery of quantum of the seas and proceeds received on our 3800 million unsecured term loan facility during 2014 

net cash provided by financing activities was 175 million for 2014 compared to net cash used in financing activities  of 5766 million for 2013 this change was primarily due to a 17 billion increase in debt proceeds and a 408 million increase in the proceeds from the exercise of common stock options partially offset by the repurchase of treasury stock of 2361 million an increase of 8677 million in repayments of debt and an increase of dividends paid of 553 million the increase in repayments of debt and proceeds from the issuance of debt was primarily due to proceeds received from an unsecured term loan of 7911 million due to the delivery of quantum of the seas in 2014 a higher level of bond maturities and higher drawings and repayments on our revolving credit facilities 

future capital commitments

please refer to funding needs and sources  for discussion on the planned funding of the above contractual obligations 

as a normal part of our business depending on market conditions pricing and our overall growth strategy we continuously consider opportunities to enter into contracts for the building of additional ships we may also consider the sale of ships or the purchase of existing ships we continuously consider potential acquisitions and strategic alliances if any of these were to occur they would be financed through the incurrence of additional indebtedness the issuance of additional shares of equity securities or through cash flows from operations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we and tui ag have each guaranteed repayment of 50  of a bank loan provided to tui cruises which is due 2022 notwithstanding this the lenders have agreed to release each shareholder’s guarantee in 2018 as of december 31 2015  €1374 million  or approximately 1494 million  based on the exchange rate at december 31 2015  remains outstanding based on current facts and circumstances we do not believe potential obligations under this guarantee are probable 

tui cruises entered into various ship construction and credit agreements that include certain restrictions on each of our and tui ags ability to reduce our current ownership interest in tui cruises below 3755  through 2021 

some of the contracts that we enter into include indemnification provisions that obligate us to make payments to the counterparty if certain events occur these contingencies generally relate to changes in taxes increased lender capital costs and other similar costs the indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms and are entered into in the normal course of business there are no stated or notional amounts included in the indemnification clauses and we are not able to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments if any under these indemnification clauses we have not been required to make any payments under such indemnification clauses in the past and under current circumstances we do not believe an indemnification obligation is probable 

other than the items described above we are not party to any other offbalance sheet arrangements including guarantee contracts retained or contingent interest certain derivative instruments and variable interest entities that either have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial position 

funding needs and sources 

we have significant contractual obligations of which our debt service obligations and the capital expenditures associated with our ship purchases represent our largest funding needs as of december 31 2015  we have approximately 30 billion  in contractual obligations due through december 31 2016  of which approximately 8914 million  relates to debt maturities 16 billion  relates to the acquisition of harmony of the seas  and ovation of the seas  along with progress payments on our other ship purchases and 2468 million  relates to interest on longterm debt we have historically relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations drawdowns under our available credit facilities the incurrence of additional debt andor the refinancing of our existing debt and the issuance of additional shares of equity securities to fund these obligations 

as of december 31 2015  we have on order three quantumclass ships and two oasisclass ships for our royal caribbean international brand and we have two project edge ships on order for our celebrity cruises brand all of which has committed unsecured bank financing arrangements which include sovereign financing guarantees refer to note 15 commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further information 

we had a working capital deficit of 35 billion  as of december 31 2015  as compared to a working capital deficit of 30 billion  as of december 31 2014  included within our working capital deficit is 8997 million  and 7996 million  of current portion of longterm debt including capital leases as of december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  respectively the increase in working capital deficit was primarily due to the increase in current liabilities of our foreign currency forward contracts and longterm debt similar to others in our industry we operate with a substantial working capital deficit this deficit is mainly attributable to the fact that under our business model a vast majority of our passenger ticket receipts are collected in advance of the applicable sailing date these advance passenger receipts remain a current liability until the sailing date the cash generated from these advance receipts is used interchangeably with cash on hand from other sources such as our revolving credit facilities and other cash from operations the cash received as advanced receipts can be used to fund operating expenses for the applicable future sailing or otherwise pay down our revolving credit facilities invest in long term investments or any other use of cash in addition we have a relatively lowlevel of accounts receivable and rapid turnover results in a limited investment in inventories we generate substantial cash flows from operations and our business model along with our unsecured revolving credit facilities has historically allowed us to maintain this working capital deficit and still meet our operating investing and financing needs we expect that we will continue to have working capital deficits in the future 

in order to improve our liquidity and take advantage of lower interest costs in june 2015 we amended and restated our 11 billion unsecured revolving credit facility due july 2016 the amendment reduced the applicable margin and facility fee and extended the termination date to june 2020 furthermore in october 2015 we received increased lender commitments in the amount of 3000 million  bringing our total capacity under this facility to 14 billion  additionally in july 2015 we amended our 12 billion unsecured revolving credit facility due august 2018 to reduce pricing in line with the pricing of the 11 billion unsecured revolving credit facility amended in june 2015 at the same time we also amended our 3800 million €3650 million 2900 million and 650 million unsecured term loans due at various dates from 2016 through 2019 to reduce the applicable margins now each 175 based on our current debt rating we also extended the termination date of the 290 million unsecured term loan from february 2016 to february 2018 refer to note 7 longterm debt  to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data   for further information

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial instruments and other 

general 

we are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices we manage these risks through a combination of our normal operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments pursuant to our hedging practices and policies the financial impact of these hedging instruments is primarily offset by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures being hedged we achieve this by closely matching the amount term and conditions of the derivative instrument with the underlying risk being hedged although certain of our derivative financial instruments do not qualify or are not accounted for under hedge accounting we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes we monitor our derivative positions using techniques including market valuations and sensitivity analyses refer to note 14 fair value measurements   and derivative instruments to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our longterm debt obligations including future interest payments at december 31 2015  approximately 312  of our longterm debt was effectively fixed as compared to 285  as of december 31 2014  we use interest rate swap agreements to modify our exposure to interest rate movements and to manage our interest expense 

market risk associated with our longterm fixedrate debt is the potential increase in fair value resulting from a decrease in interest rates we use interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a portion of our fixedrate debt to a floatingrate basis to manage this risk at december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  we maintained interest rate swap agreements on the 4200 million  fixedrate portion of our oasis of the seas  unsecured amortizing term loan and on the 6500 million  unsecured senior notes due 2022 the interest rate swap agreements on oasis of the seas  debt effectively changed the interest rate on the balance of the unsecured term loan which was 2100 million  as of december 31 2015  from a fixed rate of 541  to a liborbased floating rate equal to libor plus 387  currently approximately 440  the interest rate swap agreements on the 6500 million  unsecured senior notes effectively changed the interest rate of the unsecured senior notes from a fixed rate of 525  to a liborbased floating rate equal to libor plus 363  currently approximately 399  these interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as fair value hedges 

the estimated fair value of our longterm fixedrate debt at december 31 2015  was 18 billion  using quoted market prices where available or using the present value of expected future cash flows which incorporates risk profile the fair value of our fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements was estimated to be a liability of 118 million  as of december 31 2015  based on the present value of expected future cash flows a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates at december 31 2015  would increase the fair value of our hedged and unhedged longterm fixedrate debt by approximately 809 million  and would increase the fair value of our fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements by 481 million  

market risk associated with our longterm floatingrate debt is the potential increase in interest expense from an increase in interest rates we use interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a portion of our floatingrate debt to a fixedrate basis to manage this risk a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase our forecasted 2016  interest expense by approximately 528 million  assuming no change in foreign currency exchange rates 

at december 31 2015  we maintained forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements that hedge the anticipated unsecured amortizing term loan that will finance our purchase of harmony of the seas  forwardstarting interest rate swaps hedging the harmony of the seas  loan will effectively convert the interest rate for €6934 million  or approximately 7537 million  based on the exchange rate at december 31 2015  of the anticipated loan balance from 

euribor plus 115  to a fixed rate of 226  inclusive of margin beginning in may 2016 in addition at december 31 2015  we maintained forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements that hedge the anticipated unsecured amortizing term loan that will finance our purchase of ovation of the seas  forwardstarting interest rate swaps hedging the ovation of the seas  loan will effectively convert the interest rate for 8300 million  of the anticipated loan balance from libor plus 100  to a fixed rate of 316  inclusive of margin beginning in april 2016 these interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges 

in addition at december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  we maintained interest rate swap agreements on our celebrity reflection  term loan our interest rate swap agreements effectively converted the interest rate on a portion of the celebrity reflection  unsecured amortizing term loan balance of approximately 4909 million  from libor plus 040  to a fixed rate including applicable margin of 285  through the term of the loan additionally at december 31 2015  and december 31 2014 we maintained interest rate swap agreements on our quantum of the seas  term loan our interest rate swap agreements effectively converted the interest rate on a portion of the quantum of the seas  unsecured amortizing term loan balance of approximately 6738 million  from libor  plus 130  to a fixed rate of 374  inclusive of margin through the term of the loan furthermore at december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  we maintained interest rate swap agreements on our anthem of the seas term loan our interest rate swap agreements effectively converted the interest rate on a portion of the anthem of the seas  unsecured amortizing term loan balance of approximately 6948 million  from libor plus 130  to a fixed rate of 386  inclusive of margin through the term of the loan these interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges 

the fair value of our floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements was estimated to be a liability of 621 million  as of december 31 2015  based on the present value of expected future cash flows these interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to our ship construction contracts denominated in euros our foreign currency denominated debt and our international business operations we enter into foreign currency forward contracts collar options and crosscurrency swap agreements to manage portions of the exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 

the estimated fair value as of december 31 2015  of our eurodenominated forward contracts associated with our ship construction contracts was a liability of 3209 million  based on the present value of expected future cash flows as of december 31 2015  the aggregate cost of our ships on order not including the tui cruises ships on order was approximately 78 billion  of which we had deposited 5465 million  as of such date approximately 582  and 288  of the aggregate cost of the ships under construction was exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate at december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  respectively a hypothetical 10 strengthening of the euro as of december 31 2015  assuming no changes in comparative interest rates would result in a 4528 million  increase in the united states dollar cost of the foreign currency denominated ship construction contracts exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate the majority of our foreign currency forward contracts collar options and crosscurrency swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow fair value or net investment hedges depending on the designation of the related hedge 

our international business operations subject us to foreign currency exchange risk we transact business in many different foreign currencies and maintain investments in foreign operations which may expose us to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates movements in foreign currency exchange rates may affect the value of our earnings in foreign currencies and cash flows we manage most of this exposure on a consolidated basis which allows us to take advantage of any natural offsets therefore weakness in one particular currency might be offset by strengths in other currencies over time the extent to which one currency is effective as a natural offset of another currency fluctuates over time in addition some foreign currency exposures have little to no mitigating natural offsets available 

we consider our investments in our foreign operations to be denominated in relatively stable currencies and of a longterm nature we partially mitigate the exposure of our investments in foreign operations by denominating a portion 

of our debt in our subsidiaries’ and investments’ functional currencies and designating it as a hedge of these subsidiaries and investments we designated debt as a hedge of our net investments in pullmantur and tui cruises for €1394 million  or approximately 1687 million  through december 31 2014  as of december 31 2015 no debt was designated as a hedge of our net investments in pullmantur and tui cruises furthermore at december 31 2015  we maintained foreign currency forward contracts and designated them as hedges of a portion of our net investment in tui cruises of €3020 million  or approximately 3283 million  based on the exchange rate at december 31 2015  these forward currency contracts mature in april 2016 and their estimated fair value was an asset of 861 million  as of december 31 2015  accordingly we have included approximately 1045 million  and 450 million  of foreigncurrency transaction losses and of changes in the fair value of derivatives in the foreign currency translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive loss  at december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  respectively 

lastly on a regular basis we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and from time to time we utilize crosscurrency swap agreements to minimize the volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than our functional currency or the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries during 2015  we maintained an average of approximately 5144 million  of these foreign currency forward contracts these instruments are not designated as hedging instruments in 2015  2014  and 2013  changes in the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts were losses of approximately 555 million  486 million  and 193 million  respectively which offset gains arising from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies in those same years of 346 million  495 million  and 134 million  respectively these changes were recognized in earnings within other income expense in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss 

fuel price risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates primarily to the consumption of fuel on our ships fuel cost net of the financial impact of fuel swap agreements as a percentage of our total revenues was approximately 96  in 2015  117  in 2014  and 116  in 2013  we use fuel swap agreements to mitigate the financial impact of fluctuations in fuel prices 

as of december 31 2015  we had fuel swap agreements to pay fixed prices for fuel with an aggregate notional amount of approximately 13 billion  maturing through 2019  the fuel swap agreements represented 65  of our projected 2016  fuel requirements 59  of our projected 2017  fuel requirements 40  of our projected 2018  fuel requirements and 15  of our projected 2019  fuel requirements these fuel swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges the estimated fair value of these contracts at december 31 2015  was estimated to be a liability of 6325 million  we estimate that a hypothetical 10 increase in our weightedaverage fuel price from that experienced during the year ended december 31 2015  would increase our forecasted 2016  fuel cost by approximately 120 million  net of the impact of fuel swap agreements

industry 

cruising is considered a wellestablished vacation sector in the north american market a growing sector over the longterm in the european market and a developing but promising sector in several other emerging markets industry data indicates that market penetration rates are still low and that a significant portion of cruise guests carried are firsttime cruisers we believe this presents an opportunity for longterm growth and a potential for increased profitability 

the following table details market penetration rates for north america and europe computed based on the number of annual cruise guests as a percentage of the total population 



 

 we estimate that the global cruise fleet was served by approximately 457000  berths on approximately 283  ships at the end of 2014  there are approximately 33  ships with an estimated 98650  berths that are expected to be placed in service in the global cruise market between 2015 and 2019 although it is also possible that ships could be ordered or taken out of service during these periods we estimate that the global cruise industry carried 220 million  cruise guests in 2014  compared to 213 million  cruise guests carried in 2013  and 209 million  cruise guests carried in 2012  

the following table details the growth in global weighted average berths and the global north american and european cruise guests over the past five years

europe 

cruise guests sourced from europe represented approximately 297  of global cruise guests in 2014  the compound annual growth rate in cruise guests sourced from this market was approximately 42  from 2010  to 2014  

asiapacific 

in addition to expected industry growth in north america and europe we expect the asiapacific region to demonstrate an even higher growth rate in the near term although it will continue to represent a relatively small sector compared to north america and europe based on industry data cruise guests sourced from the asiapacific region represented approximately 85  of global cruise guests in 2014  the compound annual growth rate in cruise guests sourced from this market was approximately 164  from 2010  to 2014

passengers and capacity 

selected statistical information is shown in the following table see description of certain line items  and selected operational and financial metrics  under item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for definitions 



cruise pricing 

our cruise ticket prices include accommodations and a wide variety of activities and amenities including meals and entertainment prices vary depending on many factors including the destination cruise length stateroom category selected and the time of year the cruise takes place although we grant credit terms in select markets mainly outside 

of the united states our payment terms generally require an upfront deposit to confirm a reservation with the balance due prior to the sailing during the selling period of a cruise we continually monitor and adjust our cruise ticket prices for available guest staterooms based on demand with the objective of maximizing net yields during 2014 we developed and implemented revenue management tools that enabled us to better understand and react to the current demand and pricing environment historically we have opened cruises for sale at least one year in advance and often as much as two years in advance our air transportation program is available in major cities around the world and prices vary by gateway and destination generally air tickets are sold to guests at prices close to cost 

passenger ticket revenues accounted for approximately 73  72  and 73  of total revenues in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively 

onboard activities and other revenues 

our cruise brands offer modern fleets with a wide array of onboard services amenities and activities which vary by brand and ship while many onboard activities are included in the base price of a cruise we realize additional revenues from among other things gaming the sale of alcoholic and other beverages internet and other telecommunication services gift shop items shore excursions photography spasalon and fitness services art auctions catalogue gifts for guests and a wide variety of specialty restaurants and dining options many of these services are available for prebooking on the internet prior to embarkation

segment reporting 

we operate five whollyowned cruise brands royal caribbean international celebrity cruises azamara club cruises pullmantur and cdf croisières de france in addition we have a 50 investment in a joint venture with tui ag which operates the brand tui cruises we believe our global brands possess the versatility to enter multiple cruise market segments within the cruise vacation industry although each of our brands has its own marketing style as well as ships and crews of various sizes the nature of the products sold and services delivered by our brands share a common base ie the sale and provision of cruise vacations our brands also have similar itineraries as well as similar cost and revenue components in addition our brands source passengers from similar markets around the world and operate in similar economic environments with a significant degree of commercial overlap as a result our brands including tui cruises have been aggregated as a single reportable segment based on the similarity of their economic characteristics types of consumers regulatory environment maintenance requirements supporting systems and processes as well as products and services provided our chairman and chief executive officer has been identified as the chief operating decisionmaker and all significant operating decisions including the allocation of resources are based upon the analyses of the company as one segment  for financial information see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

employees 

as of december 31 2014  our brands excluding our 50 joint venture tui cruises employed over 64000  employees including 58000  shipboard employees as well as 5700  fulltime and 600  parttime employees in our shoreside operations as of december 31 2014  approximately 86  of our shipboard employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements 

insurance 

we maintain insurance on the hull and machinery of our ships with insured values generally equal to the net 

book value of each ship this coverage is maintained with financially sound insurance underwriters from the british scandinavian french united states and other reputable international insurance markets 

we maintain protection and indemnity liability insurance which provides coverage for liabilities costs and expenses for illness and injury to crew guest injury pollution and other thirdparty claims that arise out of or are the result of our cruise operations our vessels are insured through either the united kingdom mutual steam ship assurance association bermuda limited or the steamship mutual underwriting association bermuda limited our protection and indemnity liability insurance is done on a mutual basis and we are subject to additional premium calls in amounts based on claim records of all members of the mutual protection and indemnity association we are also subject to additional premium calls based on investment shortfalls experienced by the insurer 

we maintain war risk insurance which covers damage due to acts of war including invasion insurrection terrorism rebellion piracy and hijacking on each ship through a norwegian war risk insurance organization this coverage includes coverage for physical damage to the ship which is not covered under the hull policies as a result of war exclusion clauses in such hull policies we also maintain protection and indemnity war risk coverage for risks that would be excluded by the rules of the indemnity insurance organizations subject to certain limitations consistent with most marine war risk policies under the terms of our war risk insurance coverage underwriters can give seven days notice to us that the policy will be canceled and reinstated at higher premium rates 

  

insurance coverage for shoreside property shipboard inventory general liability offvessel liability directors  officers and network  privacy risks are maintained with insurance underwriters in the united states and the united kingdom 

we do not carry business interruption insurance for our ships based on our evaluation of the risks involved and protective measures already in place as compared to the cost of insurance 

all insurance coverage is subject to certain limitations exclusions and deductible levels in addition in certain circumstances we either selfinsure or coinsure a portion of these risks premiums charged by insurance carriers including carriers in the maritime insurance industry increase or decrease from time to time and tend to be cyclical in nature these cycles are impacted both by our own loss experience and by losses incurred in direct and reinsurance markets we historically have been able to obtain insurance coverage in amounts and at premiums we have deemed to be commercially acceptable no assurance can be given that affordable and secure insurance markets will be available to us in the future particularly for war risk insurance 

international regulations namely the european unions passenger liability regulations effective december 31 2012 and the athens convention 2002 protocol effective april 2014  require substantial increases to the level of compulsory insurance which must be maintained by passenger ship operators maintaining compliance with these regulations has not had a material impact on operating costs 

trademarks 

we own a number of registered trademarks related to the royal caribbean international celebrity cruises azamara club cruises pullmantur and cdf croisières de france cruise brands the registered trademarks include the name “royal caribbean international” and its crown and anchor logo the name “celebrity cruises” and its “x” logo the name “azamara club cruises” and its globe with an “a” logo the names “pullmantur cruises” and “pullmantur” and their logos the name “cdf croisières de france” and its logo and the names of various cruise ships as well as loyalty program names and other marketing programs we believe our trademarks are widely recognized throughout the world and have considerable value 

regulation 

our ships are regulated by various international national state and local laws regulations and treaties in force in the jurisdictions in which they operate in addition our ships are registered in the bahamas malta or in the case 

of celebrity xpedition  ecuador each ship is subject to regulations issued by its country of registry including regulations issued pursuant to international treaties governing the safety of our ships guests and crew as well as environmental protection each country of registry conducts periodic inspections to verify compliance with these regulations as discussed more fully below ships operating out of united states ports are subject to inspection by the united states coast guard for compliance with international treaties and by the united states public health service for sanitary and health conditions our ships are also subject to similar inspections pursuant to the laws and regulations of various other countries our ships visit 

we believe that we are in material compliance with all the regulations applicable to our ships and that we have all licenses necessary to conduct our business health safety security environmental and financial responsibility issues are and we believe will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant government authorities in the united states and internationally from time to time various regulatory and legislative changes may be proposed that could impact our operations and subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 

safety and security regulations 

our ships are required to comply with international safety standards defined in the international convention for safety of life at sea “solas” which among other things establishes requirements for ship design structural features materials construction life saving equipment and safe management and operation of ships to ensure guest and crew safety the solas standards are revised from time to time and the most recent modifications were phased in through 2010 compliance with these modified standards did not have a material effect on our operating costs solas incorporates the international safety management code “ism code” which provides an international standard for the safe management and operation of ships and for pollution prevention the ism code is mandatory for all vessels including passenger vessel operators 

all of our operations and ships are regularly audited by various national authorities and maintain the required certificates of compliance with the ism code 

our ships are subject to various security requirements including the international ship and port facility security code “isps code” which is part of solas and the us maritime transportation security act of 2002 “mtsa” which applies to ships that operate in us ports in order to satisfy these security requirements we implement security measures conduct vessel security assessments and develop security plans the security plans for all of our ships have been submitted to and approved by the respective countries of registry for our ships in compliance with the isps code and the mtsa 

the cruise vessel security and safety act of 2010 which applies to passenger vessels which embark or include port stops within the united states requires the implementation of certain safety design features as well as the establishment of practices for the reporting of and dealing with allegations of crime the cruise industry supported this legislation and we believe that our internal standards are generally as strict or stricter than the law requires a few provisions of the law call for regulations which have not yet been finalized however based on proposed regulations issued by the us coast guard in january 2015 we do not expect any material costs due to implementing these regulations 

environmental regulations 

we are subject to various international and national laws and regulations relating to environmental protection under such laws and regulations we are generally prohibited from discharging materials other than food waste into the waterways we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations from time to time environmental and other regulators consider more stringent regulations which may affect our operations and increase our compliance costs we believe that the impact of ships on the global environment will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world and accordingly may subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future including the items described below 

our ships are subject to the international maritime organization’s ‘‘imo’’ regulations under the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships the ‘‘marpol regulations’’ which includes requirements designed to minimize pollution by oil sewage garbage and air emissions we have obtained the relevant international compliance certificates relating to oil sewage and air pollution prevention for all of our ships 

the marpol regulations impose global limitations on the sulfur content of fuel used by ships operating worldwide permitted sulfur content was reduced from 45 to 35 on january 1 2012 this reduction has not had a material effect on our fuel and operating costs 

the marpol regulations also establish special emission control areas ‘‘ecas’’ with stringent limitations on sulfur and nitrogen oxide emissions in these areas as of february 2015  there are four established ecas the baltic sea the north seaenglish channel certain waters surrounding the north american coast and the waters surrounding puerto rico and the us virgin islands 

since january 1 2015 ships operating in ecas have been required to reduce their fuel sulfur content from 10 to 01 we have been planning for this additional requirement for the last several years and continue to take steps to mitigate the potential impact on our fuel cost both of the ships delivered in 2014  quantum of the seas  and mein schiff 3  are equipped with advanced emissions purification aep systems covering all engines in addition all of our ships on order will be built with similar capabilities as these new vessels are delivered they will provide us with additional operational and deployment flexibility 

in addition we have been actively developing and testing aep systems on our existing fleet we have now received exemptions for 19 of our ships which will apply while they are sailing in the north american and caribbean ecas these exemptions delay the requirement to comply with the additional sulfur content reduction pending our continued development and deployment of aep systems on these ships we believe that the learning from our existing endeavors as well as our further efforts with regards to this technology will allow us to execute an effective aep system retrofit strategy for our fleet 

as a result of these and other mitigating actions we believe the cost of complying with the 2015 eca sulfur emission requirement will not be significant to our results of operations in 2015 and the years following 

by january 1 2020 the marpol regulations will require the worldwide limitations on sulfur content of fuel to be further reduced to 05 if such a reduced limitation is implemented worldwide in 2020 and we have not been able to successfully mitigate the impact with evolving technical solutions our fuel costs could increase significantly 

we have also taken a number of other steps to improve the overall fuel efficiency of our fleet including our new ships on order and accordingly reduce our fuel costs we continue to work to improve the efficiency of our existing fleet including improvements in operations and voyage planning as well as improvements to the propulsion machinery hvac and lighting systems the overall impact of these efforts has resulted in a 21  improvement in energy efficiency since 2005 and we believe that our energy consumption per guest is currently the lowest in the cruise industry 

in july 2011 new marpol regulations introduced mandatory measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions these include the utilization of an energy efficiency design index eedi for new ships as well as the establishment of an energy efficient management plan for all ships the eedi is a performancebased mechanism that requires a certain minimum energy efficiency in new ships these regulations apply to new vessels commissioned after january 1 2013 compliance with these regulations has not had nor do we expect it to have a material effect on our operating costs in june 2013 the european commission proposed legislation which would require cruise ship operators using ports in the european union to monitor and report on the vessels’ annual carbon dioxide emissions starting in 2018 we expect that compliance with this regulation if adopted will not materially impact our results of operations 

labor regulations 

the international labour organization an agency of the united nations that develops worldwide employment standards has adopted a new consolidated maritime labour convention the “convention” which became effective in august 2013 the convention reflects a broad range of standards and conditions governing all aspects of crew management for ships in international commerce including additional requirements not previously in effect relating to the health safety repatriation entitlements and status of crewmembers and crew recruitment practices each of our ships has received its certification of compliance with the requirements of the convention we have not incurred and do not expect to incur material costs related to implementation and ongoing compliance with the convention 

consumer financial responsibility regulations 

we are required to obtain certificates from the united states federal maritime commission relating to our ability to satisfy liability in cases of nonperformance of obligations to guests as well as casualty and personal injury as a condition to obtaining the required certificates we arrange through our insurers for the provision of surety for three of our shipoperating companies the required surety amount is currently 220 million  per operator however under amendments approved in february 2013 the required amount will increase to 300 million  per operator by april 2015 and will be subject to additional consumer price index based adjustments thereafter we do not anticipate that compliance with the new rules will have a material effect on our costs 

we are also required by the united kingdom norway finland and the baltics to establish our financial responsibility for any liability resulting from the nonperformance of our obligations to guests from these jurisdictions in the united kingdom we are currently required by the association of british travel agents to provide performance bonds totaling approximately £315 million  the norwegian travel guarantee fund requires us to maintain performance bonds in varying amounts during the course of the year to cover our financial responsibility in norway finland and the baltics these amounts ranged from nok 33 million  to nok 87 million  during 2014  

certain other jurisdictions also require that we establish financial responsibility to our guests resulting from the nonperformance of our obligations however the related amounts do not have a material effect on our costs 

regulations regarding protection of disabled persons 

in june 2013 the us architectural and transportation barriers compliance board proposed guidelines for the construction and alteration of passenger vessels to ensure that the vessels are readily accessible to and usable by passengers with disabilities once finalized these guidelines will be used by the us department of transportation and us department of justice to implement mandatory and enforceable standards for passenger vessels covered by the americans with disabilities act while we believe our vessels have been designed and outfitted to meet the needs of our guests with disabilities we cannot at this time accurately predict whether we will be required to make material modifications or incur significant additional expenses given the preliminary status of the proposed guidelines 

taxation of the company 

the following is a summary of our principal taxes exemptions and special regimes in addition to or instead of income taxation virtually all jurisdictions where our ships call impose some tax or fee or both based on guest headcount tonnage or some other measure 

our consolidated operations are primarily foreign corporations engaged in the owning and operating of passenger cruise ships in international transportation 

united states income taxation 

the following is a discussion of the application of the united states federal and state income tax laws to us and is based on the current provisions of the united states internal revenue code treasury department regulations 

administrative rulings court decisions and the relevant state tax laws regulations rulings and court decisions of the states where we have business operations all of the foregoing is subject to change and any such change could affect the accuracy of this discussion 

application of section 883 of the internal revenue code 

we and celebrity cruises inc are engaged in a trade or business in the united states and many of our shipowning subsidiaries depending upon the itineraries of their ships receive income from sources within the united states additionally our united kingdom tonnage tax company owned by us and celebrity cruises inc is a shipoperating company classified as a partnership for united states federal income tax purposes that may earn united states source income under section 883 of the internal revenue code certain foreign corporations are not subject to united states federal income or branch profits tax on united states source income derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships including income from the leasing of such ships 

a foreign corporation will qualify for the benefits of section 883 if in relevant part 1 the foreign country in which the foreign corporation is organized grants an equivalent exemption to corporations organized in the united states and 2 the stock of the corporation or the direct or indirect corporate parent thereof is “primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market” in the united states or another qualifying country such as norway in the opinion of our united states tax counsel drinker biddle  reath llp based on the representations and assumptions set forth in that opinion we celebrity cruises inc and our shipowning subsidiaries qualify for the benefits of section 883 because we and each of those subsidiaries are incorporated in liberia or malta which are qualifying countries and our common stock is primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market in the united states or norway ie we are a publicly traded corporation if in the future 1 liberia or malta no longer qualifies as an equivalent exemption jurisdiction and we do not reincorporate in a jurisdiction that does qualify for the exemption or 2 we fail to qualify as a publicly traded corporation we and all of our shipowning or operating subsidiaries that rely on section 883 for tax exemption on qualifying income would be subject to united states federal income tax on their united states source shipping income and income from activities incidental thereto 

we believe that most of our income and the income of our shipowning subsidiaries is derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships and therefore is exempt from taxation under section 883 additionally income earned through a partnership will qualify as income derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships to the same extent as the income would so qualify if earned directly by the partners thus we believe that united states source income derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships earned by the united kingdom tonnage tax company will qualify for exemption under section 883 to the same extent as if it were earned directly by the owners of the united kingdom tonnage tax company 

regulations under section 883 list activities that are not considered by the internal revenue service to be incidental to the international operation of ships including the sale of air and land transportation shore excursions and pre and postcruise tours our income from these activities that is earned from sources within the united states will be subject to united states taxation 

taxation in the absence of an exemption under section 883 

if we the operator of our vessels celebrity cruises inc or our shipowning subsidiaries were to fail to meet the requirements of section 883 of the internal revenue code or if the provision was repealed then as explained below such companies would be subject to united states income taxation on a portion of their income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships 

because we and celebrity cruises inc conduct a trade or business in the united states we and celebrity cruises inc would be taxable at regular corporate rates on our separate company taxable income ie without regard to the income of our shipowning subsidiaries from united states sources in addition if any of our earnings and profits effectively connected with our united states trade or business were withdrawn or were deemed to have been withdrawn from our united states trade or business those withdrawn amounts would be subject to a “branch profits” tax at the rate of 30 we and celebrity cruises inc would also be potentially subject to tax on portions of certain 

interest paid by us at rates of up to 30 

if section 883 were not available to our shipowning subsidiaries each such subsidiary would be subject to a special 4 tax on its united states source gross transportation income if any each year because it does not have a fixed place of business in the united states and its income is derived from the leasing of a ship 

other united states taxation 

we and celebrity cruises inc earn united states source income from activities not considered incidental to international shipping the tax on such income is not material to our results of operation for all years presented 

state taxation 

we celebrity cruises inc and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various united states state income taxes which are generally imposed on each state’s portion of the united states source income subject to federal income taxes additionally the state of alaska subjects an allocated portion of the total income of companies doing business in alaska and certain other affiliated companies to alaska corporate state income taxes and also imposes a 33 tax on adjusted gross income from onboard gambling activities conducted in alaska waters this did not have a material impact to our results of operations for all years presented 

maltese and spanish income tax 

our pullmantur ship owneroperator subsidiaries which include the owneroperator of cdf croisières de france’s ship qualify as licensed shipping organizations in malta no maltese income tax is charged on the income derived from shipping activities of a licensed shipping organization instead a licensed shipping organization is liable to pay a tonnage tax based on the net tonnage of the ship or ships registered under the relevant provisions of the merchant shipping act a company qualifies as a shipping organization if it engages in qualifying activities and it obtains a license from the registrargeneral to enable it to carry on such activities qualifying activities include but are not limited to the ownership operation under charter or otherwise administration and management of a ship or ships registered as a maltese ship in terms of the merchant shipping act and the carrying on of all ancillary financial security and commercial activities in connection therewith 

our maltese operations that do not qualify as licensed shipping organizations which are not considered significant remain subject to normal maltese corporate income tax 

pullmantur has sales and marketing functions these activities are subject to spanish taxation the tax from these operations is not considered significant to our operations 

united kingdom income tax 

we operate fourteen ships under companies which have elected to be subject to the united kingdom tonnage tax regime “uk tonnage tax” 

companies subject to uk tonnage tax pay a corporate tax on a notional profit determined with reference to the net tonnage of qualifying vessels normal united kingdom corporate income tax is not chargeable on the relevant shipping profits of a qualifying uk tonnage tax company the requirements for a company to qualify for the uk tonnage tax regime include being subject to united kingdom corporate income tax operating qualifying ships which are strategically and commercially managed in the united kingdom and fulfilling a seafarer training requirement 

failure to meet any of these requirements could cause us to lose the benefit of the tonnage tax regime which will have a material effect on our results of operations 

relevant shipping profits include income from the operation of qualifying ships and from shipping related 

activities our united kingdom income from nonshipping activities which do not qualify under the uk tonnage tax regime and which are not considered significant remain subject to united kingdom corporate income tax 

brazilian income tax 

pullmantur and our uk tonnage tax company charters certain ships to brazilian companies for operations in brazil from november to may some of these charters are with unrelated third parties and others are with a brazilian affiliate the brazilian affiliate’s earnings are subject to brazilian taxation which is not considered significant the charter payments made to the uk tonnage tax company and to pullmantur are exempt from brazilian income tax under current brazilian domestic law additionally some remittances of revenue from sales of certain cruises in the brazilian market benefit from an exemption from withholding taxes which is scheduled to expire at the end of 2015 if the exemption is not extended this may result in increased taxation for our brazilian operations 

chinese taxation 

our uk tonnage tax company operates ships in international transportation in china the income earned from this operation is exempt from taxation in china under the ukchina double tax treaty and other circulars addressing indirect taxes changes to or failure to qualify for the treaty or circular could cause us to lose the benefits provided which would have a material impact on our results of operations our chinese income from nonshipping activities or from shipping activities not qualifying for treaty or circular protection and which are considered insignificant remain subject to chinese taxation 

other taxation 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to valueadded and other indirect taxes most of which are reclaimable zerorated or exempt changes in the application or interpretation of applicable indirect tax laws or changes in tax legislation could have a material impact on our results of operations

 item 1a risk factors 

the risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k are important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historical results it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks the risks described below are only those known risks relating to our operations and financial condition that we consider material there may be additional risks that we consider not to be material or which are not known and any of these risks could have the effects set forth below   see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a cautionary note regarding forwardlooking statements 

adverse worldwide economic geopolitical or other conditions could reduce the demand for cruises and adversely impact our operating results cash flows and financial condition including potentially impairing the value of our ships goodwill and other assets 

the demand for cruises is affected by international national and local economic and geopolitical conditions in recent years we have been faced with very challenging global economic conditions which have adversely affected vacationers’ discretionary income and consumer confidence this in turn resulted in cruise booking slowdowns decreased cruise prices and lower onboard revenues for us and for others in the cruise industry as compared to more robust economic times although the cruise industry continued to recover in 2014 ongoing economic challenges continue in certain key markets including europe in addition we cannot predict with any certainty whether demand for cruises will continue to improve in countries that have experienced improved economic conditions or the strength of such improvement any significant deterioration of global national or local economic conditions could result in a prolonged period of booking slowdowns depressed cruise prices and reduced onboard revenues demand for our cruises is also influenced by geopolitical events unfavorable conditions such as crossborder conflicts civil unrest and governmental changes especially in regions with popular ports of call can undermine consumer demand andor pricing for itineraries featuring these ports 

continued unrest and economic instability could materially adversely impact our operating results cash flows and financial condition including potentially impairing the value of our ships goodwill and other assets see critical accounting policies for more information 

we may not be able to obtain sufficient financing or capital for our needs or may not be able to do so on terms that are acceptable or consistent with our expectations 

to fund our capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments we have historically relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations drawdowns under available credit facilities the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the sale of equity or debt securities in private or public securities markets we also condition the effectiveness of our ship orders on obtaining committed financing arrangements any circumstance or event which leads to a decrease in consumer cruise spending such as worsening global economic conditions or significant incidents impacting the cruise industry could negatively affect our operating cash flows see “ adverse worldwide economic geopolitical or other conditions… ” and “ incidents or adverse publicity concerning the cruise vacation industry…” for more information 

although we believe we can access sufficient liquidity to fund our operations and obligations as expected there can be no assurances to that effect our ability to access additional funding as and when needed our ability to timely refinance andor replace our outstanding debt securities and credit facilities on acceptable terms and our cost of funding will depend upon numerous factors including but not limited to the vibrancy of the financial markets our financial performance and the performance of our industry in general 

our inability to satisfy the covenants required by our credit facilities could adversely impact our liquidity 

our debt agreements contain covenants including covenants restricting our ability to take certain actions and financial covenants in addition our ability to make borrowings under our available credit facilities is subject to the absence of material adverse changes in our business our ability to maintain our credit facilities may also be impacted by changes in our ownership base more specifically we may be required to prepay a majority of our debt facilities if 

i any person or entity other than a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates and their respective affiliates the “applicable group” acquires ownership of more than 33 of our common stock and the applicable group owns less of our common stock than such person or ii subject to certain exceptions during any 24month period a majority of the board is no longer comprised of individuals who were members of the board on the first day of such period certain of our outstanding debt securities also contain change of control provisions that would be triggered by the acquisition of greater than 50 of our common stock by a person other than a member of the applicable group coupled with a ratings downgrade 

our failure to comply with the terms of our debt facilities could result in an event of default generally if an event of default under any debt agreement occurs then pursuant to cross default acceleration clauses our outstanding debt and derivative contract payables could become due andor terminated in addition in such events our credit card processors could hold back payments to create a reserve we cannot provide assurances that we would have sufficient liquidity to repay or the ability to refinance the borrowings under any of the credit facilities or settle other outstanding contracts if such amounts were accelerated upon an event of default 

incidents or adverse publicity concerning the cruise vacation industry unusual weather conditions and other natural disasters or disruptions could affect our reputation as well as impact our sales and results of operations 

the ownership andor operation of cruise ships airplanes land tours port facilities and shore excursions involves the risk of accidents illnesses mechanical failures environmental incidents and other incidents which may bring into question safety health security and vacation satisfaction which could negatively impact our reputation incidents involving cruise ships and in particular the safety and security of guests and crew media coverage thereof as well as adverse media publicity concerning the cruise vacation industry have impacted and could in the future impact demand for our cruises and pricing in the industry the considerable expansion in the use of social media and digital marketing over recent years has compounded the potential scope of the negative publicity that could be generated by those incidents if any such incident occurs during a time of high seasonal demand the effect could disproportionately impact our results of operations for the year in addition incidents involving cruise ships may result in additional costs to our business increasing government or other regulatory oversight and in the case of incidents involving our ships potential litigation 

our cruise ships and port facilities may also be adversely impacted by unusual weather patterns or natural disasters or disruptions such as hurricanes and earthquakes we are often forced to alter itineraries and occasionally to cancel a cruise or a series of cruises due to these or other factors which could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability in addition these and any other events which impact the travel industry more generally may negatively impact our ability to deliver guests or crew to our cruises andor interrupt our ability to obtain services and goods from key vendors in our supply chain any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and on industry performance 

the impact of disruptions in the global financial markets may affect the ability of our counterparties and others to perform their obligations to us 

the financial crisis of 2008 including failures of financial service and insurance companies and the related liquidity crisis disrupted the capital and credit markets a recurrence of these or similar disruptions could cause our counterparties and others to breach their obligations to us under our contracts with them this could include failures of banks or other financial service companies to fund required borrowings under our loan agreements or to pay us amounts that may become due under our derivative contracts for hedging of fuel prices interest rates and foreign currencies or other agreements if any of the foregoing occurs it may have a negative impact on our cash flows including our ability to meet our obligations our results of operations and our financial condition 

an increase in capacity worldwide or excess capacity in a particular market could adversely impact our cruise sales andor pricing 

although our ships can be redeployed cruise sales andor pricing may be impacted both by the introduction of new ships into the marketplace and by deployment decisions of ourselves and our competitors a total of 33 new ships 

with approximately 98650 berths are on order for delivery through 2019 in the cruise industry the further growth in capacity from these new ships and future orders without an increase in the cruise industry’s share of the vacation market could depress cruise prices and impede our ability to achieve yield improvement 

in addition to the extent that we or our competitors deploy ships to a particular itinerary and the resulting capacity in that region exceeds the demand we may lower pricing and profitability may be lower than anticipated 

any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition including potentially impairing the value of our ships goodwill and other assets 

if we are unable to appropriately balance our cost management strategies with our goal of satisfying guest expectations it may adversely impact our business success 

our goals call for us to provide high quality products and deliver high quality services there can be no assurances that we can successfully balance these goals with our cost management strategies 

we may lose business to competitors throughout the vacation market    

we operate in the vacation market and cruising is one of many alternatives for people choosing a vacation we therefore risk losing business not only to other cruise lines but also to other vacation operators which provide other leisure options including hotels resorts and package holidays and tours 

we face significant competition from other cruise lines on the basis of cruise pricing travel agent preference and also in terms of the nature of ships and services we offer to guests our principal competitors within the cruise vacation industry include carnival corporation  plc which owns among others aida cruises carnival cruise line costa cruises cunard line holland america line po cruises and princess cruises disney cruise line msc cruises norwegian cruise line holdings ltd which owns norwegian cruise line oceania cruises and regent seven seas cruises 

in the event that we do not compete effectively with other vacation alternatives and cruise companies our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

fears of terrorist and pirate attacks war and other hostilities and the spread of contagious diseases could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

events such as terrorist and pirate attacks war and other hostilities including the recent escalation of tensions in the middle east and terrorism incidents in europe and the resulting political instability travel restrictions the spread of contagious diseases and concerns over safety health and security aspects of traveling or the fear of any of the foregoing have had and could have in the future a significant adverse impact on demand and pricing in the travel and vacation industry in view of our global operations we have become susceptible to a wider range of adverse events 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates fuel costs and interest rates could affect our financial results 

we are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates fuel prices and changes in interest rates high levels of volatility with respect to any of the foregoing could have a material impact on our financial results net of the impact of our hedging activities and other natural offsets see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ” for more information 

environmental labor health and safety financial responsibility and other maritime regulations could affect operations and increase operating costs 

the united states and various state and foreign government or regulatory agencies have enacted or are considering new environmental regulations or policies such as requiring the use of low sulfur fuels increasing fuel efficiency requirements further restricting emissions or other initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions that could increase our cost for fuel limit the supply of compliant fuel cause us to incur significant expenses to purchase andor develop 

new equipment and adversely impact the cruise vacation industry while we have taken and expect to continue to take a number of actions to mitigate the potential impact of certain of these regulations there can be no assurances that these efforts will be successful some environmental groups have also lobbied for more stringent regulation of cruise ships and have generated negative publicity about the cruise vacation industry and its environmental impact see item 1 businessregulationenvironmental regulations  an increase in fuel prices not only impacts our fuel costs but also some of our other expenses such as crew travel freight and commodity prices 

in addition we are subject to various international national state and local laws regulations and treaties that govern among other things safety standards applicable to our ships treatment of disabled persons health and sanitary standards applicable to our guests security standards on board our ships and at the shipport interface areas and financial responsibilities to our guests these issues are and we believe will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world this could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise ships that could subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 

conducting business globally may result in increased costs and other risks 

we operate our business globally operating internationally exposes us to a number of risks including increased exposure to a wider range of regional and local economic conditions volatile local political conditions potential changes in duties and taxes including changing andor uncertain interpretations of existing tax laws and regulations required compliance with additional laws and policies affecting cruising vacation or maritime businesses or governing the operations of foreignbased companies currency fluctuations interest rate movements difficulties in operating under local business environments port quality and availability in certain regions us and global antibribery laws or regulations imposition of trade barriers and restrictions on repatriation of earnings we have recently expanded our presence in china and accordingly our exposure to the risks of doing business in the country china’s economy differs from the economies of other developed countries in many respects and as the legal system in china continues to evolve there may be greater uncertainty as to the interpretation and enforcement of applicable laws and regulations 

operating globally also exposes us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal regulatory and tax requirements in many parts of the world including countries in which we operate practices in the local business communities might not conform to international business standards we must adhere to policies designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance as well as applicable laws and regulations however we might not be successful in ensuring that our employees agents representatives and other third parties with which we associate throughout the world properly adhere to them failure by us our employees or any of these third parties to adhere to our policies or applicable laws or regulations could result in penalties sanctions damage to our reputation and related costs which in turn could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows 

if we are unable to address these risks adequately our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected including potentially impairing the value of our ships goodwill and other assets 

our attempts to expand our business into new markets may not be successful 

while our historical focus has been to serve the north american cruise market we have expanded our focus to increase our international guest sourcing including sourcing from the asian latin american and australian markets expansion into new markets requires significant levels of investment there can be no assurance that these markets will develop as anticipated or that we will have success in these markets and if we do not we may be unable to recover our investment which could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations including potentially impairing the value of our goodwill 

ship construction repair or upgrade delays or mechanical faults may result in cancellation of cruises or unscheduled drydocks and repairs and thus adversely affect our results of operations 

we depend on shipyards to construct repair and upgrade our cruise ships on a timely basis and in good working order the sophisticated nature of building a ship involves risks delays in ship construction or upgrades or mechanical faults have in the past and may in the future result in delays or cancellation of cruises or necessitate unscheduled 

drydocks and repairs of ships these events and any related adverse publicity could result in lost revenue increased operating expenses or both and thus adversely affect our results of operations 

shipyards and their subcontractors may experience financial difficulties or consolidation which could cause or result in delay ship cancellations our inability to procure new capacity in a timely fashion or increases in shipbuilding costs that could adversely affect our results of operations 

we rely on shipyards to construct repair and upgrade our ships financial difficulties liquidations or closures suffered by these shipyards andor their subcontractors may impact the timely delivery or costs of new ships or the ability of shipyards to repair and upgrade our fleet in accordance with our needs or expectations in addition there are a limited number of shipyards with the capability and capacity to build our new ships and accordingly consolidation in the cruise shipyard industry could impact our ability to construct new ships when and as planned andor could result in stronger bargaining power on the part of the shipyards and thus higher prices for our future ship orders delivery delays and canceled deliveries can adversely affect our results of operations as can any constraints on our ability to build repair and maintain our ships on a timely basis 

our operating costs could increase due to market forces and economic or geo political factors beyond our control 

our operating costs including fuel food payroll airfare taxes insurance and security costs are all subject to increases due to market forces and economic or political conditions or other factors beyond our control increases in these operating costs could adversely affect our profitability 

unavailability of ports of call may adversely affect our results of operations    

we believe that port destinations are a major reason why guests choose to go on a particular cruise or on a cruise vacation the availability of ports is affected by a number of factors including existing capacity constraints constraints related to the size of certain ships security concerns adverse weather conditions and natural disasters financial limitations on port development exclusivity arrangements that ports may have with our competitors local governmental regulations and local community concerns about port development and other adverse impacts on their communities from additional tourists in addition rising fuel costs may adversely impact the destinations on certain of our itineraries any limitations on the availability or feasibility of our ports of call or on the availability of shore excursion and other service providers at such ports could adversely affect our results of operations 

price increases for commercial airline service for our guests or major changes or reduction in commercial airline service andor availability could adversely impact the demand for cruises and undermine our ability to provide reasonably priced vacation packages to our guests 

many of our guests depend on scheduled commercial airline services to transport them to or from the ports where our cruises embark or disembark increases in the price of airfare would increase the overall price of the cruise vacation to our guests which may adversely impact demand for our cruises in addition changes in the availability of commercial airline services could adversely affect our guests’ ability to obtain airfare as well as our ability to fly our guests to or from our cruise ships which could adversely affect our results of operations 

our reliance on travel agencies to sell and market our cruises exposes us to certain risks which if realized could adversely impact our business 

because we rely on travel agencies to generate the majority of bookings for our ships we must ensure that our commission rates and incentive structures remain competitive if we fail to offer competitive compensation packages these agencies may be incentivized to sell cruises offered by our competitors to our detriment which could adversely impact our operating results in addition the travel agent industry is sensitive to economic conditions that impact discretionary income significant disruptions especially disruptions impacting those agencies that sell a high volume of our business or contractions in the industry could reduce the number of travel agencies available for us to market and sell our cruises which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

disruptions in our shoreside operations or our information systems may adversely affect our results of operations 

our principal executive office and principal shoreside operations are located at the port of miami florida and we have shoreside offices throughout the world actual or threatened natural disasters eg hurricanes earthquakes tornadoes fires floods or similar events in these locations may have a material impact on our business continuity reputation and results of operations in addition substantial or repeated information systems failures computer viruses or cyberattacks impacting our shoreside or shipboard operations could adversely impact our business we do not generally carry business interruption insurance for our shoreside operations or our information systems as such any losses or damages incurred by us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

failure to develop the value of our brands and differentiate our products could adversely affect our results of operations 

our success depends on the strength and continued development of our cruise brands and on the effectiveness of our brand strategies failure to protect and differentiate our brands from competitors throughout the vacation market could adversely affect our results of operations 

the loss of key personnel our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel or disruptions among our shipboard personnel due to strained employee relations could adversely affect our results of operations 

our success depends in large part on the skills and contributions of key executives and other employees and on our ability to recruit and retain high quality personnel in key markets we must continue to sufficiently recruit retain train and motivate our employees to maintain our current business and support our projected global growth furthermore as of december 31 2014 86  of our shipboard employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements a dispute under our collective bargaining agreements could result in a work stoppage of those employees covered by the agreements a loss of key employees or disruptions among our personnel could adversely affect our results of operations 

business activities that involve our coinvestment with third parties may subject us to additional risks 

partnerships joint ventures and other business structures involving our coinvestment with third parties such as our joint venture to operate tui cruises our new partnership to operate skysea cruises our investment in grand bahama shipyard and our minority ownership investments in various port development and other projects generally include some form of shared control over the operations of the business and create additional risks including the possibility that other investors in such ventures could become bankrupt or otherwise lack the financial resources to meet their obligations or could have or develop business interests policies or objectives that are inconsistent with ours in addition actions by another investor may present additional risks of operational difficulties or reputational or legal concerns these or other issues related to our coinvestment with third parties could adversely impact our operations 

we rely on thirdparty providers of various services integral to the operations of our businesses these third parties may act in ways that could harm our business 

in order to achieve cost and operational efficiencies we outsource to thirdparty vendors certain services that are integral to the operations of our global businesses such as our onboard concessionaires certain of our call center operations and operation of a large part of our information technology systems we are subject to the risk that certain decisions are subject to the control of our thirdparty service providers and that these decisions may adversely affect our activities a failure to adequately monitor a thirdparty service provider’s compliance with a service level agreement or regulatory or legal requirements could result in significant economic and reputational harm to us there is also a risk the confidentiality privacy andor security of data held by third parties or communicated over thirdparty networks or platforms could become compromised 

a failure to keep pace with developments in technology or technological obsolescence could impair our operations or competitive position 

our business continues to demand the use of sophisticated technology and systems these technologies and systems must be refined updated andor replaced with more advanced systems in order to continue to meet our customers’ demands and expectations if we are unable to do so in a timely manner or within reasonable cost parameters or if we are unable to appropriately and timely train our employees to operate any of these new systems our business could suffer we also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new technology or system and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could impair our operating results 

we may be exposed to risks and costs associated with cyber security including protecting the integrity and security of our guests’ and employees’ personal information 

we are subject to various risks associated with the collection handling storage and transmission of sensitive information including risks related to compliance with applicable laws and other contractual obligations as well as the risk that our systems collecting such information could be compromised in the course of doing business we collect large volumes of internal and customer data including personally identifiable information for various business purposes if we fail to comply with the various applicable data collection and privacy laws we could be exposed to fines penalties restrictions litigation or other expenses and our business could be adversely impacted 

in addition even if we are fully compliant with legal standards and contractual requirements we still may not be able to prevent security breaches involving sensitive data any breach theft loss or fraudulent use of guest employee or company data could adversely impact our reputation and brand and our ability to retain or attract new customers and expose us to risks of data loss business disruption governmental investigation litigation and other liability any of which could adversely affect our business significant capital investments and other expenditures could be required to remedy the problem and prevent future breaches including costs associated with additional security technologies personnel experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached additionally the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyberattacks and breaches of information technology systems as well as the sources and targets of these attacks change frequently and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time our security measures cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breaches 

a change in our tax status under the united states internal revenue code or other jurisdictions may have adverse effects on our income  

we and a number of our subsidiaries are foreign corporations that derive income from a united states trade or business andor from sources within the united states drinker biddle  reath llp our united states tax counsel has delivered to us an opinion based on certain representations and assumptions set forth in it to the effect that this income to the extent derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships is exempt from united states federal income tax pursuant to section 883 of the internal revenue code we believe that most of our income including that of our subsidiaries is derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships 

our ability to rely on section 883 could change in the future provisions of the internal revenue code including section 883 are subject to legislative change at any time moreover changes could occur in the future with respect to the identity residence or holdings of our direct or indirect shareholders trading volume or trading frequency of our shares or relevant foreign tax laws of liberia or malta such that they no longer qualify as equivalent exemption jurisdictions that could affect our eligibility for the section 883 exemption accordingly there can be no assurance that we will continue to be exempt from united states income tax on united states source shipping income in the future if we were not entitled to the benefit of section 883 we and our subsidiaries would be subject to united states taxation on a portion of the income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships which would reduce our net income 

additionally portions of our business are operated by companies that are within tonnage tax regimes of the uk and malta further some of the operations of these companies are conducted in jurisdictions where we rely on tax 

treaties to provide exemption from taxation to the extent the tonnage tax laws of these countries change or we do not continue to meet the applicable qualification requirements or if tax treaties are changed or revoked we may be required to pay higher income tax in these jurisdictions adversely impacting our results of operations 

as budgetary constraints continue to adversely impact the jurisdictions in which we operate increases in income tax regulations or tax reform affecting our operations may be imposed 

we are not a united states corporation and our shareholders may be subject to the uncertainties of a foreign legal system in protecting their interests 

our corporate affairs are governed by our articles of incorporation and bylaws and by the business corporation act of liberia the provisions of the business corporation act of liberia resemble provisions of the corporation laws of a number of states in the united states however while most states have a fairly well developed body of case law interpreting their respective corporate statutes there are very few judicial cases in liberia interpreting the business corporation act of liberia as such the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under liberian law are not as clearly established as the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in certain united states jurisdictions for example the right of shareholders to bring a derivative action in liberian courts may be more limited than in united states jurisdictions there may also be practical difficulties for shareholders attempting to bring suit in liberia and liberian courts may or may not recognize and enforce foreign judgments thus our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests with respect to actions by management directors or controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a united states jurisdiction 

litigation enforcement actions fines or penalties could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations andor damage our reputation 

our business is subject to various united states and international laws and regulations that could lead to enforcement actions fines civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims and damages in addition improper conduct by our employees agents or joint venture partners could damage our reputation andor lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties including substantial monetary fines in certain circumstances it may not be economical to defend against such matters andor a legal strategy may not ultimately result in us prevailing in a matter such events could lead to an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

provisions of our articles of incorporation bylaws and liberian law could inhibit others from acquiring us prevent a change of control and may prevent efforts by our shareholders to change our management 

certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and liberian law may inhibit third parties from effectuating a change of control of the company without board approval which could result in the entrenchment of current management these include provisions in our articles of incorporation that prevent third parties other than a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates from acquiring beneficial ownership of more than 49 of our outstanding shares without the consent of our board of directors

we also operate two private destinations which we utilize as a portofcall on certain of our itineraries i an island we own in the bahamas which we call cococay and ii labadee a secluded peninsula we lease on the north coast of haiti 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

a c lass action complaint was filed in june 2011 against royal caribbean cruises ltd in the united states district court for the southern district of florida on behalf of a purported class of stateroom attendants employed onboard royal caribbean international cruise vessels the complaint alleged that the stateroom attendants were required to pay other crew members to help with their duties and that certain stateroom attendants were required to work back of house assignments without the ability to earn gratuities in each case in violation of the us seaman’s wage act in may 2012 the district court granted our motion to dismiss the complaint on the basis that the applicable collective bargaining agreement requires any such claims to be arbitrated the united states court of appeals 11th circuit affirmed the district court’s dismissal and denied the plaintiffs’ petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc in october 2014 the united states supreme court denied the plaintiffs’ request to review the order compelling arbitration subsequently approximately 575  crew members submitted demands for arbitration the demands make substantially the same allegations as in the federal court complaint and are similarly seeking damages wage penalties and interest in an indeterminate amount unlike the federal court complaint the demands for arbitration are being brought individually by each of the crew members and not on behalf of a purported class of stateroom attendants at this time we are unable to estimate the possible impact of this matter on us however we believe the underlying claims made against us are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against them 

we are routinely involved in other claims typical within the cruise vacation industry the majority of these claims are covered by insurance we believe the outcome of such claims net of expected insurance recoveries will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations and cash flows

overview 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations have been organized to present the following 

 critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap see note 1 general  and note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  certain of our accounting policies are deemed critical as they require managements highest degree of judgment estimates and assumptions we have discussed these accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors we believe our most critical accounting policies are as follows 

ship accounting 

our ships represent our most significant assets and are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization depreciation of ships is generally computed net of a 15 projected residual value using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of the asset which is generally 30 years the 30year useful life of our newly constructed ships and 15 associated residual value are both based on the weightedaverage of all major components 

of a ship our useful life and residual value estimates take into consideration the impact of anticipated technological changes longterm cruise and vacation market conditions and historical useful lives of similarlybuilt ships in addition we take into consideration our estimates of the weightedaverage useful lives of the ships major component systems such as hull superstructure main electric engines and cabins given the very large and complex nature of our ships our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain we do not have cost segregation studies performed to specifically componentize our ship systems therefore we estimate the costs of component systems based principally on general and technical information known about major ship component systems and their lives and our knowledge of the cruise vacation industry we do not identify and track depreciation by ship component systems but instead utilize these estimates to determine the net cost basis of assets replaced or refurbished improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized as additions to the ship and depreciated over the shorter of the improvements estimated useful lives or that of the associated ship the estimated cost and accumulated depreciation of replaced or refurbished ship components are written off and any resulting losses are recognized in cruise operating expenses  

we use the deferral method to account for drydocking costs under the deferral method drydocking costs incurred are deferred and charged to expense on a straightline basis over the period to the next scheduled drydock which we estimate to be a period of thirty to sixty months based on the vessels age as required by class deferred drydock costs consist of the costs to drydock the vessel and other costs incurred in connection with the drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessels class certification class certification is necessary in order for our cruise ships to be flagged in a specific country obtain liability insurance and legally operate as passenger cruise ships the activities associated with those drydocking costs cannot be performed while the vessel is in service and as such are done during a drydock as a planned major maintenance activity the significant deferred drydock costs consist of hauling and wharfage services provided by the drydock facility hull inspection and related activities eg scraping pressure cleaning bottom painting maintenance to steering propulsion thruster equipment and ballast tanks port services such as tugs pilotage and line handling and freight associated with these items we perform a detailed analysis of the various activities performed for each drydock and only defer those costs that are directly related to planned major maintenance activities necessary to maintain class the costs deferred are related to activities not otherwise routinely periodically performed to maintain a vessels designed and intended operating capability repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred 

we use judgment when estimating the period between drydocks which can result in adjustments to the estimated amortization of drydock costs if the vessel is disposed of before the next drydock the remaining balance in deferred drydock is writtenoff to the gain or loss upon disposal of vessel in the period in which the sale takes place we also use judgment when identifying costs incurred during a drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessels class certification as compared to those costs attributable to repairs and maintenance which are expensed as incurred 

we believe we have made reasonable estimates for ship accounting purposes however should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimates of ship useful lives or projected residual values depreciation expense could be materially higher or lower if circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making determinations as to whether ship improvements should be capitalized the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance costs could increase partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense if we had reduced our estimated average 30year ship useful life by one year depreciation expense for 2014  would have increased by approximately 243 million  if our ships were estimated to have no residual value depreciation expense for 2014  would have increased by approximately 1591 million  

valuation of goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets and longlived assets 

we review goodwill trademarks and trade names which are our most significant indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or when events or circumstances dictate more frequently the impairment review for goodwill consists of a qualitative assessment of whether it is morelikelythannot that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount and if necessary a twostep goodwill impairment test factors to consider when performing the qualitative assessment include general economic conditions limitations on accessing capital changes in forecasted operating results changes in fuel prices and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates if the qualitative assessment demonstrates that it is morelikelythannot that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value it is not necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test we may elect to 

bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to step one for any reporting unit in any period we can resume the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any subsequent period 

when performing the twostep goodwill impairment test the fair value of the reporting unit is determined and compared to the carrying value of the net assets allocated to the reporting unit we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a probabilityweighted discounted cash flow model the estimation of fair value utilizing discounted expected future cash flows includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of expected revenues operating costs marketing selling and administrative expenses interest rates ship additions and retirements as well as assumptions regarding the cruise vacation industrys competitive environment and general economic and business conditions among other factors the principal assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model are projected operating results weightedaverage cost of capital and terminal value the discounted cash flow model uses our 2015  projected operating results as a base to that base we add future years cash flows assuming multiple revenue and expense scenarios that reflect the impact of different global economic environments beyond 2015  on the reporting unit we discount the projected cash flows using rates specific to the reporting unit based on its weightedaverage cost of capital if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value no further analysis or writedown of goodwill is required if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of its net assets the implied fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all its underlying assets and liabilities including both recognized and unrecognized tangible and intangible assets based on their fair value if necessary goodwill is then written down to its implied fair value 

the impairment review for indefinitelife intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount we estimate the fair value of our indefinitelife intangible assets which consist of trademarks and trade names related to pullmantur using a discounted cash flow model and the relieffromroyalty method the royalty rate used is based on comparable royalty agreements in the tourism and hospitality industry the discount rate used is comparable to the rate used in valuing the pullmantur reporting unit in our goodwill impairment test if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess if the fair value exceeds its carrying amount the indefinitelife intangible asset is not considered impaired other intangible assets assigned finite useful lives are amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives 

we review our ships aircraft and other longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable we evaluate asset impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities the lowest level for which we maintain identifiable cash flows that are independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities is at the ship level for our ships and at the aggregated asset group level for our aircraft if estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of an asset an impairment charge is recognized to the extent its carrying value exceeds fair value 

we estimate fair value based on quoted market prices in active markets if available if active markets are not available we base fair value on independent appraisals sales price negotiations and projected future cash flows discounted at a rate estimated by management to be commensurate with the business risk quoted market prices are often not available for individual reporting units and for indefinitelife intangible assets accordingly we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit and an indefinitelife intangible asset using an expected present value technique 

pullmantur 

during the fourth quarter of 2014  we performed our annual impairment review of goodwill for pullmanturs reporting unit we did not perform a qualitative assessment but instead proceeded directly to the twostep goodwill impairment test as a result of the test we determined the fair value of the pullmantur reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 52  resulting in no impairment to pullmanturs goodwill we also performed the annual impairment review of pullmanturs trademarks and trade names using a discounted cash flow model and the relieffromroyalty method to compare the fair value of these indefinitelived intangible assets to its carrying value the results of our testing indicated that the fair value of the trademarks and trade names exceeded its carrying value by approximately 4 resulting in no impairment to pullmanturs trademarks and tradenames for the year ended december 31 2014  

in connection with the december 2013 agreement to sell a majority stake in pullmantur’s noncore businesses we agreed to retain certain longlived assets consisting of the aircraft owned and operated by pullmantur air due to the anticipated change in the nature of the cash flows to be generated by the pullmantur aircraft during the fourth quarter of 2013 we reviewed the aircraft for impairment we identified that the undiscounted future cash flows of the aircraft were less than their carrying value and recorded an impairment charge of 489 million  during the fourth quarter of 2013 which is reported in restructuring and related impairment charges  in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss 

during the fourth quarter of 2012 we performed the annual impairment evaluation of our goodwill and trademarks and trade names and we recognized total impairment related charges of 4139 million  associated with our pullmantur brand included in this amount was a 100 valuation allowance of our deferred tax assets which resulted in a deferred income tax expense of 337 million  recorded during the fourth quarter of 2012 in addition pullmantur has a deferred tax liability that was recorded at the time of acquisition this liability represents the tax effect of the basis difference between the tax and book values of the trademarks and trade names that were acquired at the time of the acquisition due to the 2012 impairment charge related to these intangible assets we reduced the deferred tax liability and recorded a deferred tax benefit of 52 million  during the fourth quarter of 2012 the net 285 million  impact of these adjustments was recognized in earnings during the fourth quarter of 2012 and was reported within other income expense  in our statements of comprehensive income loss 

pullmantur is a brand targeted primarily at the spanish portuguese and latin american markets with an increasing focus on latin america the persistent economic instability in these markets has created significant uncertainties in forecasting operating results and future cash flows used in our impairment analyses we continue to monitor economic events in these markets for their potential impact on pullmantur’s business and valuation further the estimation of fair value utilizing discounted expected future cash flows includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of expected revenues operating costs marketing selling and administrative expenses interest rates ship additions and retirements as well as assumptions regarding the cruise vacation industrys competitive environment and general economic and business conditions among other factors 

if there are changes to the projected future cash flows used in the impairment analyses especially in net yields or if anticipated transfers of vessels from our other cruise brands to the pullmantur fleet do not take place it is possible that an impairment charge of pullmantur’s reporting unit’s goodwill and trademarks and trade names may be required of these factors the planned transfers of vessels to the pullmantur fleet is most significant to the projected future cash flows if the transfers do not occur we will likely fail step one of the goodwill impairment test and record an impairment loss related to our trademarks and tradenames as of december 31 2014  the carrying amounts of our goodwill and trademarks and trade names attributable to our pullmantur reporting unit was 1336 million  and 1880 million  respectively 

royal caribbean international 

during the fourth quarter of 2014  we performed a qualitative assessment of the royal caribbean international reporting unit based on our qualitative assessment we concluded that it was morelikelythannot that the estimated fair value of the royal caribbean international reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and thus we did not proceed to the twostep goodwill impairment test no indicators of impairment exist primarily because the reporting units fair value has consistently exceeded its carrying value by a significant margin its financial performance has been solid in the face of mixed economic environments and forecasts of operating results generated by the reporting unit appear sufficient to support its carrying value as of december 31 2014  the carrying amount of goodwill attributable to our royal caribbean international reporting unit was 2870 million  

derivative instruments 

we enter into various forward swap and option contracts to manage our interest rate exposure and to limit our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices these instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value and the vast majority are designated as hedges we also have nonderivative financial instruments designated as hedges of our net investment in our foreign operations and investments the fuel options we entered into represent economic hedges which were not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes and thus changes in their fair value were immediately recognized in earnings although certain of our derivative 

financial instruments do not qualify or are not accounted for under hedge accounting we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes we account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with authoritative guidance refer to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  and note 14 fair value measurements and derivative instruments  to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for more information on related authoritative guidance the companys hedging programs and derivative financial instruments 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and collars interest rate crosscurrency and fuel swaps and options with thirdparty institutions in overthecounter markets we estimate the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate and crosscurrency swaps using expected future cash flows based on the instruments contract terms and published forward prices for foreign currency exchange and interest rates we apply present value techniques and liborbased discount rates to convert the expected future cash flows to the current fair value of the instruments 

we estimate the fair value of our foreign currency collars using standard option pricing models with inputs based on the options contract terms such as exercise price and maturity and readily available public market data such as foreign exchange prices foreign exchange volatility levels and discount rates 

we estimate the fair value of our fuel swaps using expected future cash flows based on the swaps contract terms and forward prices we derive forward prices from forward fuel curves based on pricing inputs provided by thirdparty institutions that transact in the fuel indices we hedge we validate these pricing inputs against actual market transactions and published price quotes for similar assets we apply present value techniques and liborbased discount rates to convert the expected future cash flows to the current fair value of the instruments we also corroborate our fair value estimates using valuations provided by our counterparties 

we estimate the fair value for our fuel call options based on the prevailing market price for the instruments consisting of published price quotes for similar assets based on recent transactions in an active market 

we adjust the valuation of our derivative financial instruments to incorporate credit risk 

we believe it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate crosscurrency and fuel swaps and options would be derived from other appropriate valuation models using similar assumptions inputs or conditions suggested by actual historical experience 

contingencies—litigation 

on an ongoing basis we assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss if any can be made in assessing probable losses we take into consideration estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries if any which are recorded as assets when recoverability is probable we accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recoveries it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made 

seasonality 

our revenues are seasonal based on demand for cruises demand is strongest for cruises during the northern hemispheres summer months and holidays in order to mitigate the impact of the winter weather in the northern hemisphere and to capitalize on the summer season in the southern hemisphere our brands have focused on deployment to australia and latin america during that period 

financial presentation 

description of certain line items 

revenues 

our revenues are comprised of the following 

 cruise operating expenses 

our cruise operating expenses are comprised of the following 

 we do not allocate payroll and related expenses food expenses fuel expenses or other operating expenses to the expense categories attributable to passenger ticket revenues or onboard and other revenues since they are incurred to provide the total cruise vacation experience 

selected operational and financial metrics 

we utilize a variety of operational and financial metrics which are defined below to evaluate our performance and financial condition as discussed in more detail herein certain of these metrics are nongaap financial measures which we believe provide useful information to investors as a supplement to our consolidated financial statements which are prepared and presented in accordance with gaap the presentation of nongaap financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap 

adjusted earnings per share  represents adjusted net income divided by weighted average shares outstanding or by diluted weighted average shares outstanding as applicable we believe that this nongaap measure is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis 

adjusted net income  represents net income excluding certain items that we believe adjusting for is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis for the periods presented these items included restructuring and related impairment charges other costs related to our profitability initiatives the estimated impact of the divested pullmantur noncore businesses impairment of pullmantur related assets the loss recognized on the sale of celebrity century the impact of the change in our voyage proration methodology and the reversal of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance due to spanish tax reform the estimated impact of the divested pullmantur noncore businesses was arrived at by adjusting the net income loss of these businesses for the ownership percentage we retained as well as for intercompany transactions that are no longer eliminated in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss subsequent to the sales transaction for the full year 2014 the impact of the voyage proration change represents net income that would have been recognized in 2013 had we recognized revenues and cruise operating expenses on a prorata basis for all voyages 

available passenger cruise days  apcd is our measurement of capacity and represents double occupancy per cabin multiplied by the number of cruise days for the period we use this measure to perform capacity and rate analysis to identify our main noncapacity drivers that cause our cruise revenue and expenses to vary 

gross cruise costs  represent the sum of total cruise operating expenses plus marketing selling and administrative expenses 

gross yields  represent total revenues per apcd 

net cruise costs  and net cruise costs excluding fuel  represent gross cruise costs excluding commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses and in the case of net cruise costs excluding fuel fuel expenses each of which is described above under the description of certain line items  heading in measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income we believe changes in net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance a reconciliation of historical gross cruise costs to net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel is provided below under results of operations  we have not provided a quantitative reconciliation of projected gross cruise costs to projected net cruise costs and projected net cruise costs excluding fuel due to the significant uncertainty in projecting the costs deducted to arrive at these measures accordingly we do not believe that reconciling information for such projected figures would be meaningful for the periods prior to the sale of the pullmantur noncore businesses net cruise costs excludes the estimated impact of these divested businesses net cruise costs also excludes initiative costs reported within marketing selling and administrative expenses as well as the loss recognized on the sale of celebrity century  included within other operating expenses 

net debttocapital  is a ratio which represents total longterm debt including the current portion of longterm debt less cash and cash equivalents net debt divided by the sum of net debt and total shareholders equity we believe net debt and net debttocapital along with total longterm debt and shareholders equity are useful measures of our capital structure a reconciliation of historical debttocapital to net debttocapital is provided below under results of operations 

net revenues represent total revenues less commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses each of which is described above under the description of certain line items  heading for the periods prior 

to the sale of the pullmantur noncore businesses we have presented net revenues excluding the estimated impact of these divested businesses in the financial tables under results of operations  

net yields  represent net revenues per apcd we utilize net revenues and net yields to manage our business on a daytoday basis as we believe that it is the most relevant measure of our pricing performance because it reflects the cruise revenues earned by us net of our most significant variable costs which are commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses a reconciliation of historical gross yields to net yields is provided below under results of operations  we have not provided a quantitative reconciliation of projected gross yields to projected net yields due to the significant uncertainty in projecting the costs deducted to arrive at this measure accordingly we do not believe that reconciling information for such projected figures would be meaningful for the periods prior to the sale of the pullmantur noncore businesses net yields excludes the estimated impact of these divested businesses 

occupancy  in accordance with cruise vacation industry practice is calculated by dividing passenger cruise days by apcd a percentage in excess of 100 indicates that three or more passengers occupied some cabins 

passenger cruise days  represent the number of passengers carried for the period multiplied by the number of days of their respective cruises 

we believe net yields net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel are our most relevant nongaap financial measures however a significant portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar because our reporting currency is the united states dollar the value of these revenues and expenses can be affected by changes in currency exchange rates although such changes in local currency prices is just one of many elements impacting our revenues and expenses it can be an important element for this reason we also monitor net yields net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel as if the current periods currency exchange rates had remained constant with the comparable prior periods rates or on a constant currency basis 

it should be emphasized that constant currency is primarily used for comparing shortterm changes andor projections over the longer term changes in guest sourcing and shifting the amount of purchases between currencies can significantly change the impact of the purely currencybased fluctuations 

the use of certain significant nongaap measures such as net yields net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel allows us to perform capacity and rate analysis to separate the impact of known capacity changes from other less predictable changes which affect our business we believe these nongaap measures provide expanded insight to measure revenue and cost performance in addition to the standard united states gaap based financial measures there are no specific rules or regulations for determining nongaap and constant currency measures and as such there exists the possibility that they may not be comparable to other companies within the industry 

executive overview 

midway through 2014 we announced our doubledouble program which called for increasing the company’s return on invested capital roic to double digits and doubling our 2014 adjusted earnings per share both by 2017 our aim through this program is to provide shareholders with increased visibility into our longterm financial goals by means of a formalized and measured framework to achieve these goals we maintain our focus on three key objectives growing revenue yields maintaining cost consciousness and pursuing moderate capacity growth 

our 2014 results were in line with our doubledouble program based on our results we remain confident that we are on the right path for realizing these objectives we finished 2014 with net income of 7641 million or 343 per diluted share compared to 4737 million or 214 per diluted share in 2013 adjusted net income was 7557 million or 339 per share compared to 5392 million or 244 per share in 2013 adjusted earnings per share of 339 per share represented approximately a 40 increase in yearoveryear eps growth and established a new record for our company 

caribbean capacity for the industry grew by 13 in 2014 and comprised 49 of our total capacity this considerable growth led to increased levels of promotional activity throughout the industry and depressed our pricing power helping offset the caribbean was the doubledigit yield improvement in europe and china the european season was the strongest we have seen in several years and china’s ability to absorb our capacity growth while driving higher yields continues to impress 

despite the difficulties in the caribbean the company grew 2014 net yields by 24 on a constant currency basis net ticket revenue yield improved 14 while onboard revenue yield increased by 38 on a constant currency basis onboard revenue continues to be a bright spot with beverage packages specialty restaurants and internet packages driving strong growth in the caribbean and europe while gaming and retail are fueling our growth in asia this coupled with our investments in ship revitalizations and technology has helped continue onboard’s strong growth trajectory 

net cruise costs excluding fuel decreased by 06 on a constant currency basis the continued commitment to our profitability improvement plan allowed us to invest strategically in core markets our product marketing and technology while maintaining a lean cost structure 

we continue to see a nice boost in earnings from our equity investments most notably tui as this brand continues to grow through new ship deliveries we anticipate their contribution to earnings will grow proportionally 

looking ahead at 2015 we see the challenges in the caribbean continuing through the first quarter of 2015 but then improving significantly through the summer and beyond as industry capacity declines the us consumer bolstered by the stronger dollar and improving economy appears to be making a comeback while european consumer spending seems to be more restrained 

quantum of the seas’  arrival in china is approaching and we feel encouraged by the advance demand that the ship has generated in the market our capacity in asia continues to surge with 53 growth in 2015 on top of 22 growth in 2014 investments in the region will continue to expand in order to ensure we maintain our position in the market 

in the fourth quarter of 2014 we saw a rapid decline in fuel prices that was coupled with a strengthening in the us dollar this produced some volatility in our earnings and this trend is persisting in the first quarter of 2015 as fuel prices continue to fluctuate considerably while the us dollar continues to appreciate our fuel hedging program and some natural currency offsets within our results of operations will help mitigate the volatility but will not eliminate it completely 

our commitment to moderate capacity growth continues and our anticipated growth through 2017 remains unchanged since the announcement of our doubledouble program in 2015 we will take delivery of quantum of the seas’ sister ship anthem of the seas  followed by ovation of the seas  and the third oasisclass vessel in 2016 these ships are materially more energy efficient than our fleet average and we expect them to generate strong consumer 

demand and propel our earnings growth in 2014 we announced an order for a new generation of vessels for the celebrity cruises brand and have ordered two ships with the first one being delivered in 2018 while we continue to grow our fleet through newbuilds we also consider opportunities to divest of older tonnage as evidenced with our sale of celebrity century  to a subsidiary of skysea holding in 2014 

our 2015 will be an important step towards our doubledouble goals we expect to deliver stepchange earnings growth by leveraging our innovative hardware strong brands global footprint and exceptional employees

liquidity and capital resources 

sources and uses of cash   

cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity net cash provided by operating activities increased 3317 million  to 17 billion  for 2014  compared to 14 billion  for 2013  the increase was primarily due to a decrease in interest paid in 2014 compared to 2013  and the timing of proceeds from accounts receivable and payments to vendors in 2014  net cash provided by operating activities in 2013 remained consistent compared to 2012 

net cash used in investing activities was 18 billion  for 2014  compared to 8245 million  for 2013  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in capital expenditures of 10 billion  in 2014  compared to 2013  primarily due to the delivery of quantum of the seas and the purchase of brilliance of the seas in 2014  additionally there was an increase in investments in and loans to unconsolidated affiliates of 1180 million   and an increase in cash paid on the settlement of derivative financial instruments of 508 million  these cash outlays were partially offset by cash received of 2200 million  in 2014  for the sale of celebrity century  which did not occur in 2013  and a 528 million  increase in cash received from repayments of a loan to an unconsolidated affiliate in 2014  compared to 2013  

net cash used in investing activities was 8245 million for 2013 compared to 13 billion for 2012 the decrease in 2013 compared to 2012 is primarily due to a decrease in capital expenditures of 5277 million attributable to the delivery of a ship celebrity reflection  in 2012 which did not recur in 2013 partially offset by a higher level of ships under construction in 2013 compared to 2012 the decrease in capital expenditures was partially offset by investments of 706 million to our unconsolidated affiliates during 2013 

net cash provided by financing activities was 175 million  for 2014  compared to net cash used in financing activities  of 5766 million  for 2013  this change was primarily due to a 17 billion  increase in debt proceeds and a 408 million  increase in the proceeds from the exercise of common stock options partially offset by the repurchase of treasury stock of 2361 million  an increase of 8677 million  in repayments of debt and an increase of dividends paid of 553 million  the increase in repayments of debt and proceeds from issuance of debt was primarily due to proceeds received from an unsecured term loan of 7911 million  due to the delivery of quantum of the seas in 2014 a higher level of bond maturities and higher drawings and repayments on our revolving credit facilities 

net cash used in financing activities was 5766 million for 2013 compared to 1796 million for 2012 this change was primarily due to an increase of 2952 million in repayments of debt and an increase of 259 million paid in dividends partially offset by a decrease of 1090 million in debt proceeds 

future capital commitments 

our future capital commitments consist primarily of new ship orders as of december 31 2014  we had two quantumclass ships and two oasisclass ships on order for our royal caribbean international brand with an aggregate capacity of approximately 19200 berths additionally we have two project edge ships on order for our celebrity cruises brand with an aggregate capacity of approximately 5800 berths which are expected to become effective in the second quarter of 2015 

as of december 31 2014  the aggregate cost of our ships on order not including the project edge ships was approximately 50 billion  of which we had deposited 3944 million  as of such date approximately 288  of the aggregate cost was exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate at december 31 2014  see note 14 fair value measurements and derivative instruments and note 15 commitments and contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

as of december 31 2014  anticipated overall capital expenditures based on our existing ships on order are approximately 16 billion  for 2015  23 billion  for 2016  04 billion  for 2017  and 22 billion  for 2018  

contractual obligations

please refer to funding needs and sources  for discussion on the planned funding of the above contractual obligations 

as a normal part of our business depending on market conditions pricing and our overall growth strategy we continuously consider opportunities to enter into contracts for the building of additional ships we may also consider the sale of ships or the purchase of existing ships we continuously consider potential acquisitions and strategic alliances if any of these were to occur they would be financed through the incurrence of additional indebtedness the issuance of additional shares of equity securities or through cash flows from operations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in connection with the sale of celebrity mercury  in february 2011 we and tui ag each guaranteed repayment of 50  of a €1800 million  amortizing bank loan provided to tui cruises which is due 2016 as of december 31 2014  €1170 million  or approximately 1416 million  based on the exchange rate at december 31 2014  remains outstanding based on current facts and circumstances we do not believe potential obligations under this guarantee are probable 

tui cruises has entered into construction agreements with meyer turku shipyard that includes certain restrictions on each of our and tui ags ability to reduce our current ownership interest in tui cruises below 375  through 2019 

some of the contracts that we enter into include indemnification provisions that obligate us to make payments to the counterparty if certain events occur these contingencies generally relate to changes in taxes increased lender capital costs and other similar costs the indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms and are entered into in the normal course of business there are no stated or notional amounts included in the indemnification clauses and we are not able to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments if any under these indemnification clauses we have not been required to make any payments under such indemnification clauses in the past and under current circumstances we do not believe an indemnification obligation is probable 

other than the items described above we are not party to any other offbalance sheet arrangements including guarantee contracts retained or contingent interest certain derivative instruments and variable interest entities that either have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial position 

funding needs and sources 

we have significant contractual obligations of which our debt service obligations and the capital expenditures associated with our ship purchases represent our largest funding needs as of december 31 2014  we have approximately 23 billion  in contractual obligations due through december 31 2015  of which approximately 7909 million  relates to debt maturities 9468 million  relates to the acquisition of anthem of the seas  along with progress payments on our other ship purchases and 2452 million  relates to interest on longterm debt we have historically relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations drawdowns under our available credit facilities the incurrence of additional debt andor the refinancing of our existing debt and the issuance of additional shares of equity securities to fund these obligations 

we had a working capital deficit of 30 billion  as of december 31 2014  as compared to a working capital deficit of 33 billion  as of december 31 2013  included within our working capital deficit is 7996 million  and 16 billion  of current portion of longterm debt including capital leases as of december 31 2014  and december 31 2013  respectively the decrease in working capital deficit was primarily due to the decrease in current maturities of longterm debt similar to others in our industry we operate with a substantial working capital deficit this deficit is mainly attributable to the fact that under our business model a vast majority of our passenger ticket receipts are collected in advance of the applicable sailing date these advance passenger receipts remain a current liability until the sailing date the cash generated from these advance receipts is used interchangeably with cash on hand from other sources such as our revolving credit facilities and other cash from operations the cash received as advanced receipts can be used to fund operating expenses for the applicable future sailing or otherwise pay down our revolving credit facilities invest in long term investments or any other use of cash in addition we have a relatively lowlevel of accounts receivable and rapid turnover results in a limited investment in inventories we generate substantial cash flows from operations and our business model along with our unsecured revolving credit facilities has historically allowed us to 

maintain this working capital deficit and still meet our operating investing and financing needs we expect that we will continue to have working capital deficits in the future 

as of december 31 2014  we have on order two quantumclass ships and two oasisclass ships each of which has committed unsecured bank financing arrangements which include sovereign financing guarantees refer to note 15 commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further information 

during 2014 we repaid our €7450 million 5625 unsecured senior notes with proceeds from our 3800 million unsecured term loan facility and our revolving credit facilities and we amended and restated our €3650 million unsecured term loan due july 2017 primarily to reduce the margin on the facility additionally in march 2014 we amended our unsecured term loans for oasis of the seas  and allure of the seas  primarily to reduce the margins on those facilities and eliminate the lenders option to exit those facilities in 2015 and 2017 respectively 

during 2014 we increased the capacity of our unsecured revolving credit facility due august 2018 by 300 million  by utilizing the accordion feature bringing our total capacity under this facility to 12 billion  as of december 31 2014 we purchased the brilliance of the seas for a net settlement purchase price of approximately £1754 million  or 2754 million  using proceeds from this facility refer to note 7 longterm debt to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for further information 

as of december 31 2014  we had liquidity of 10 billion  consisting of approximately 1892 million  in cash and cash equivalents and 8009 million  available under our unsecured credit facilities we anticipate that our cash flows from operations and our current financing arrangements as described above will be adequate to meet our capital expenditures and debt repayments over the next twelvemonth period 

we implemented a broad profitability improvement program with initiatives aimed at improving our returns on invested capital one of those initiatives commenced in the third quarter of 2013 relates to realizing economies of scale and improving service delivery to our travel partners and guests by restructuring and consolidating our global sales marketing and general and administrative structure a second initiative commenced in the fourth quarter of 2013 relates to pullmantur’s focus on its cruise business and expansion in latin america during 2014 we incurred approximately 30 million in cash outlays to implement these initiatives and we do not expect any further cash outlays to be significant 

we also continue to implement a number of initiatives to reduce energy consumption and by extension fuel costs these include the design of more fuel efficient ships and the implementation of other hardware and energy efficiencies 

if i any person other than a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates and their respective affiliates the “applicable group” acquires ownership of more than 33 of our common stock and the applicable group owns less of our common stock than such person or ii subject to certain exceptions during any 24month period a majority of the board is no longer comprised of individuals who were members of the board on the first day of such period we may be obligated to prepay indebtedness outstanding under the majority of our credit facilities which we may be unable to replace on similar terms certain of our outstanding debt securities also contain change of control provisions that would be triggered by the acquisition of greater than 50 of our common stock by a person other than a member of the applicable group coupled with a ratings downgrade if this were to occur it would have an adverse impact on our liquidity and operations 

debt covenants 

certain of our financing agreements contain financial covenants that require us among other things to maintain minimum net worth of at least 62 billion  a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 125x and limit our net debttocapital ratio to no more than 625  the fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated by dividing net cash from operations for the past four quarters by the sum of dividend payments plus scheduled principal debt payments in excess of any new financings for the past four quarters our minimum net worth and maximum net debttocapital calculations 

exclude the impact of accumulated other comprehensive loss income  on total shareholders equity  we are well in excess of all financial covenant requirements as of december 31 2014  the specific covenants and related definitions can be found in the applicable debt agreements the majority of which have been previously filed with the securities and exchange commission

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial instruments and other 

general 

we are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices we manage these risks through a combination of our normal operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments pursuant to our hedging practices and policies the financial impact of these hedging instruments is primarily offset by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures being hedged we achieve this by closely matching the amount term and conditions of the derivative instrument with the underlying risk being hedged although certain of our derivative financial instruments do not qualify or are not accounted for under hedge accounting we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes we monitor our derivative positions using techniques including market valuations and sensitivity analyses see note 14 fair value measurements   and derivative instruments to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our longterm debt obligations including future interest payments at december 31 2014  approximately 285  of our longterm debt was effectively fixed as compared to 346  as of december 31 2013  we use interest rate swap agreements to modify our exposure to interest rate movements and to manage our interest expense 

market risk associated with our longterm fixedrate debt is the potential increase in fair value resulting from a decrease in interest rates we use interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a portion of our fixedrate debt to a floatingrate basis to manage this risk at december 31 2014  and december 31 2013  we maintained interest rate swap agreements on the 4200 million  fixedrate portion of our oasis of the seas  unsecured amortizing term loan and on the 6500 million  unsecured senior notes due 2022 the interest rate swap agreements on oasis of the seas  debt effectively changed the interest rate on the balance of the unsecured term loan which was 2450 million  as of december 31 2014  from a fixed rate of 541  to a liborbased floating rate equal to libor plus 387  currently approximately 420  the interest rate swap agreements on the 6500 million  unsecured senior notes effectively changed the interest rate of the unsecured senior notes from a fixed rate of 525  to a liborbased floating rate equal to libor plus 363  currently approximately 386  these interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as fair value hedges 

the estimated fair value of our longterm fixedrate debt at december 31 2014  was 21 billion  using quoted market prices where available or using the present value of expected future cash flows which incorporates risk profile the fair value of our fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements was estimated to be a liability of 223 million  as of december 31 2014  based on the present value of expected future cash flows a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates at december 31 2014  would increase the fair value of our hedged and unhedged longterm fixedrate debt by approximately 964 million  and would increase the fair value of our fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements by 555 million  

market risk associated with our longterm floatingrate debt is the potential increase in interest expense from an increase in interest rates we use interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a portion of our floatingrate debt to a fixedrate basis to manage this risk a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase our forecasted 2015  interest expense by approximately 484 million  assuming no change in foreign currency exchange rates 

at december 31 2014  and december 31 2013  we maintained forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements that hedge the anticipated unsecured amortizing term loan that will finance our purchase of anthem of the seas  forwardstarting interest rate swaps hedging the anthem of the seas  loan will effectively convert the interest rate for 7250 million  of the anticipated loan balance from libor plus 130  to a fixed rate of 386  inclusive of margin beginning 

in april 2015 the fair value of our floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements was estimated to be a liability of 475 million  as of december 31 2014  based on the present value of expected future cash flows these interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges 

in addition at december 31 2014  and december 31 2013  we maintained interest rate swap agreements on our celebrity reflection  term loan our interest rate swap agreements effectively converted the interest rate on a portion of the celebrity reflection  unsecured amortizing term loan balance of approximately 5454 million  from libor plus 040  to a fixed rate including applicable margin of 285  through the term of the loan furthermore at december 31 2014  we maintained interest rate swap agreements on our quantum of the seas  term loan our interest rate swap agreements effectively converted the interest rate on a portion of the quantum of the seas  unsecured amortizing term loan balance of approximately 7350 million  from libor  plus 130  to a fixed rate of 374  inclusive of margin through the term of the loan these interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to our ship construction contracts denominated in euros our foreign currency denominated debt and our international business operations we enter into foreign currency forward contracts collar options and crosscurrency swap agreements to manage portions of the exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 

the estimated fair value as of december 31 2014  of our eurodenominated forward contracts associated with our ship construction contracts was a liability of 1822 million  based on the present value of expected future cash flows as of december 31 2014  the aggregate cost of our ships on order was approximately 50 billion  of which we had deposited 3944 million  as of such date approximately 288  and 363  of the aggregate cost of the ships under construction was exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate at december 31 2014  and december 31 2013  respectively a hypothetical 10 strengthening of the euro as of december 31 2014  assuming no changes in comparative interest rates would result in a 1884 million  increase in the united states dollar cost of the foreign currency denominated ship construction contracts exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate the majority of our foreign currency forward contracts collar options and crosscurrency swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow fair value or net investment hedges depending on the designation of the related hedge 

  

during 2012 we entered into foreign currency collar options to hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposure on the construction contract price for anthem of the seas  these options mature in april 2015 and their fair value was estimated to be a liability of 219 million  at december 31 2014  

our international business operations subject us to foreign currency exchange risk we transact business in many different foreign currencies and maintain investments in foreign operations which may expose us to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates movements in foreign currency exchange rates may affect the translated value of our earnings and cash flows we manage most of this exposure on a consolidated basis which allows us to take advantage of any natural offsets therefore weakness in one particular currency might be offset by strengths in other currencies over time 

we consider our investments in our foreign operations to be denominated in relatively stable currencies and of a longterm nature we partially mitigate the exposure of our investments in foreign operations by denominating a portion of our debt in our subsidiaries’ and investments’ functional currencies and designating it as a hedge of these subsidiaries and investments we designated debt as a hedge of our net investments in pullmantur and tui cruises of approximately €1394 million  and €5449 million  or approximately 1687 million  and 7508 million  through december 31 2014  and december 31 2013  respectively a hypothetical 10 increase or decrease in the december 31 2014  euro exchange rate would increase or decrease the fair value of our assigned debt by 169 million  which would be offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the united states dollar value of our net investment furthermore during 2014 we entered into foreign currency forward contracts and designated them as hedges of a portion of our net investments in pullmantur and tui cruises of €4156 million  or approximately 5029 million  based on the exchange rate at december 31 2014  these forward currency contracts mature in april 2016 and their estimated fair value was an asset of 640 million  as of december 31 2014  accordingly we have included approximately 450 million and 

444 million of foreigncurrency transaction gains losses and of changes in the fair value of derivatives in the foreign currency translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive loss income  at december 31 2014  and december 31 2013  respectively 

lastly on a regular basis we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and from time to time we have utilized crosscurrency swap agreements to minimize volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than our functional currency or the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries during 2014 we maintained an average of approximately 4740 million  of these foreign currency forward contracts these instruments are not designated as hedging instruments in 2014 2013 and 2012 changes in the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts were losses gains of approximately 486 million  193 million  and 77 million  respectively which offset gains losses arising from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies in those same years of 495 million  134 million  and 118 million  respectively these changes were recognized in earnings within other income expense  in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss 

fuel price risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates primarily to the consumption of fuel on our ships fuel cost net of the financial impact of fuel swap agreements as a percentage of our total revenues was approximately 117  in 2014  116  in 2013  and 118  in 2012  we use fuel swap agreements to mitigate the financial impact of fluctuations in fuel prices 

as of december 31 2014  we had fuel swap agreements to pay fixed prices for fuel with an aggregate notional amount of approximately 14 billion  maturing through 2018  the fuel swap agreements represented 58  of our projected 2015  fuel requirements 55  of our projected 2016  fuel requirements 35  of our projected 2017  fuel requirements and 15  of our projected 2018  fuel requirements these fuel swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges the estimated fair value of these contracts at december 31 2014  was estimated to be a liability of 4978 million  we estimate that a hypothetical 10 increase in our weightedaverage fuel price from that experienced during the year ended december 31 2014  would increase our forecasted 2015  fuel cost by approximately 227 million  net of the impact of fuel swap agreements

industry 

cruising is considered a wellestablished vacation sector in the north american market a growing sector over the longterm in the european market and a developing but promising sector in several other emerging markets 

industry data indicates that market penetration rates are still low and that a significant portion of cruise guests carried are firsttime cruisers we believe this presents an opportunity for longterm growth and a potential for increased profitability 

the following table details market penetration rates for north america and europe computed based on the number of annual cruise guests as a percentage of the total population 



 

 we estimate that the global cruise fleet was served by approximately 436000 berths on approximately 269 ships at the end of 2013 there are approximately 26 ships with an estimated 71000 berths that are expected to be placed in service in the global cruise market between 2014 and 2018 although it is also possible that ships could be ordered or taken out of service during these periods we estimate that the global cruise industry carried 213 million cruise guests in 2013 compared to 209 million cruise guests carried in 2012 and 202 million cruise guests carried in 2011 

the following table details the growth in global weighted average berths and the global north american and european cruise guests over the past five years

operations 

cruise ships and itineraries 

as of december 31 2013 our brands including our 50 joint venture tui cruises operate 41 ships with a selection of worldwide itineraries ranging from two to 23 nights that call on approximately 490 destinations 

the following table presents summary information concerning the ships we will operate in 2014 under these six cruise brands and their geographic areas of operation based on 2014 itineraries subject to change 





 

 

our brands including our 50 joint venture tui cruises have six ships on order three ships on order are being built in germany by meyer werft gmbh two are being built in finland by stx finland and one will be built in france by stx france the expected dates that our ships on order will enter service and their approximate berths are as follows 



seasonality 

our revenues are seasonal based on the demand for cruises demand is strongest for cruises during the northern hemisphere’s summer months and holidays in order to mitigate the impact of the winter weather in the northern hemisphere and to capitalize on the summer season in the southern hemisphere our brands have focused on deployment in australia and latin america during that period 

passengers and capacity 

selected statistical information is shown in the following table see description of certain line items  and selected operational and financial metrics  under item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for definitions 



cruise pricing 

our cruise ticket prices include accommodations and a wide variety of activities and amenities including meals and entertainment prices vary depending on many factors including the destination cruise length stateroom category selected and the time of year the cruise takes place although we grant credit terms in select markets mainly outside of the united states our payment terms generally require an upfront deposit to confirm a reservation with the balance due prior to the sailing during the selling period of a cruise we continually monitor and adjust our cruise ticket prices for available guest staterooms based on demand with the objective of maximizing net yields in 2013 we launched new initiatives which enable us to set pricing and leverage enhancements for the web and our reservation systems during 2014 we will continue to develop and implement revenue management tools that we believe will enable us to better understand and react to the current demand and pricing environment historically we have opened cruises for sale at least one year in advance and often as much as two years in advance our air transportation program is available in major cities around the world and prices vary by gateway and destination generally air tickets are sold to guests at prices close to cost 

passenger ticket revenues accounted for approximately 72 of total revenues in 2013 and approximately 73 of total revenues in 2012 and 2011 while none of our brands are currently charging fuel supplements we have introduced temporary fuel supplements from time to time 

onboard activities and other revenues 

our cruise brands offer modern fleets with a wide array of onboard services amenities and activities which vary by brand and ship while many onboard activities are included in the base price of a cruise we realize additional revenues from among other things gaming the sale of alcoholic and other beverages gift shop items shore excursions photography spasalon and fitness services art auctions catalogue gifts for guests and a wide variety of specialty restaurants and dining options royal caribbean international celebrity cruises and azamara club cruises offer functionality on their respective internet sites for selecting shore excursions specialty dining and amenities prior to embarkation 

in conjunction with our cruise vacations we offer pre and postcruise hotel packages to our royal caribbean international celebrity cruises and azamara club cruises guests during 2013 we expanded the markets in which we sell our cruise vacation protection coverage which provides guests with coverage for trip cancellation medical protection and baggage protection onboard and other revenues accounted for approximately 28 of total revenues in 2013 and approximately 27 of total revenues in 2012 and 2011 

segment reporting 

we operate five whollyowned cruise brands royal caribbean international celebrity cruises azamara club cruises pullmantur and cdf croisières de france in addition we have a 50 investment in a joint venture with tui ag which operates the brand tui cruises we believe our global brands possess the versatility to enter multiple cruise market segments within the cruise vacation industry although each of our brands has its own marketing style as well as ships and crews of various sizes the nature of the products sold and services delivered by our brands share a common base ie the sale and provision of cruise vacations our brands also have similar itineraries as well as similar cost and revenue components in addition our brands source passengers from similar markets around the world and operate in similar economic environments with a significant degree of commercial overlap as a result our brands including tui cruises have been aggregated as a single reportable segment based on the similarity of their economic characteristics types of consumers regulatory environment maintenance requirements supporting systems and processes as well as products and services provided our chairman and chief executive officer has been identified as the chief operating decisionmaker and all significant operating decisions including the allocation of resources are based upon the analyses of the company as one segment  for financial information see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

employees 

as of december 31 2013 we employed approximately 64000 employees including 57000 shipboard employees as well as 6200 fulltime and 700 parttime employees in our shoreside operations as of december 31 2013 approximately 80 of our shipboard employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements 

insurance 

we maintain insurance on the hull and machinery of our ships which includes additional coverage for disbursements earnings and increased value which are maintained in amounts related to the net book value of each ship the coverage for each of the hull policies is maintained with syndicates of insurance underwriters from the british scandinavian french united states and other international insurance markets 

we maintain liability protection and indemnity insurance for each of our ships through either the united kingdom mutual steam ship assurance association bermuda limited or the steamship mutual underwriting association bermuda limited our protection and indemnity liability insurance is done on a mutual basis and we are subject 

to additional premium calls in amounts based on claim records of all members of the mutual protection and indemnity association we are also subject to additional premium calls based on investment shortfalls experienced by the insurer 

we maintain war risk insurance which covers damage due to acts of war including invasion insurrection terrorism rebellion piracy and hijacking on each ship through a norwegian war risk insurance organization this coverage includes coverage for physical damage to the ship which is not covered under the hull policies as a result of war exclusion clauses in such hull policies we also maintain protection and indemnity war risk coverage for risks that would be excluded by the rules of the indemnity insurance organizations subject to certain limitations consistent with most marine war risk policies under the terms of our war risk insurance coverage underwriters can give seven days notice to us that the policy will be canceled and reinstated at higher premium rates 

  

insurance coverage for shoreside property shipboard inventory and general liability risks are maintained with insurance underwriters in the united states and the united kingdom 

we do not carry business interruption insurance for our ships based on our evaluation of the risks involved and protective measures already in place as compared to the cost of insurance 

all insurance coverage is subject to certain limitations exclusions and deductible levels in addition in certain circumstances we either selfinsure or coinsure a portion of these risks premiums charged by insurance carriers including carriers in the maritime insurance industry increase or decrease from time to time and tend to be cyclical in nature these cycles are impacted both by our own loss experience and by losses incurred in direct and reinsurance markets we historically have been able to obtain insurance coverage in amounts and at premiums we have deemed to be commercially acceptable no assurance can be given that affordable and secure insurance markets will be available to us in the future particularly for war risk insurance 

recent european union regulations effective december 31 2012 and the 2002 protocol to the athens convention effective april 2014 for countries that have ratified the protocol both provide for substantial increases to the level of compulsory insurance which must be maintained by passenger ship operators compliance with these eu regulations has not had a material impact on operating costs and we do not expect that compliance with the 2002 protocol when it becomes effective will have a material impact on our operating costs 

trademarks 

we own a number of registered trademarks related to the royal caribbean international celebrity cruises azamara club cruises pullmantur and cdf croisières de france cruise brands the registered trademarks include the name “royal caribbean international” and its crown and anchor logo the name “celebrity cruises” and its “x” logo the name “azamara club cruises” and its globe with an “a” logo the names “pullmantur cruises” and “pullmantur” and their logos the name “cdf croisières de france” and its logo and the names of various cruise ships we believe our trademarks are widely recognized throughout the world and have considerable value 

regulation 

our ships are regulated by various international national state and local laws regulations and treaties in force in the jurisdictions in which they operate in addition our ships are registered in the bahamas malta or in the case of celebrity xpedition  ecuador each ship is subject to regulations issued by its country of registry including regulations issued pursuant to international treaties governing the safety of our ships guests and crew as well as environmental protection each country of registry conducts periodic inspections to verify compliance with these regulations as discussed more fully below ships operating out of united states ports are subject to inspection by the united states coast guard for compliance with international treaties and by the united states public health service for sanitary and health conditions our ships are also subject to similar inspections pursuant to the laws and regulations of various other countries our ships visit 

we believe that we are in material compliance with all the regulations applicable to our ships and that we have 

all licenses necessary to conduct our business health safety security environmental and financial responsibility issues are and we believe will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant government authorities in the united states and internationally from time to time various regulatory and legislative changes may be proposed that could impact our operations and subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 

safety and security regulations 

our ships are required to comply with international safety standards defined in the international convention for safety of life at sea “solas” which among other things establishes requirements for ship design structural features materials construction life saving equipment and safe management and operation of ships to ensure guest and crew safety the solas standards are revised from time to time and the most recent modifications were phased in through 2010 compliance with these modified standards did not have a material effect on our operating costs solas incorporates the international safety management code “ism code” which provides an international standard for the safe management and operation of ships and for pollution prevention the ism code is mandatory for all vessels including passenger vessel operators 

all of our operations and ships are regularly audited by various national authorities and maintain the required certificates of compliance with the ism code 

our ships are subject to various security requirements including the international ship and port facility security code “isps code” which is part of solas and the us maritime transportation security act of 2002 “mtsa” which applies to ships that operate in us ports in order to satisfy these security requirements we implement security measures conduct vessel security assessments and develop security plans the security plans for all of our ships have been submitted to and approved by the respective countries of registry for our ships in compliance with the isps code and the mtsa 

the cruise vessel security and safety act of 2010 which applies to passenger vessels which embark or include port stops within the united states requires the implementation of certain safety design features as well the establishment of practices for the reporting of and dealing with allegations of crime the cruise industry supported this legislation and we believe that our internal standards are generally as strict or stricter than the law requires a few provisions of the law call for regulations which have not yet been issued we expect the us coast guard to issue these regulations in 2014 while we cannot predict the full scope of such regulations we believe we already meet or exceed the requirements of the act and do not expect any material costs due implementing these regulations 

environmental regulations 

we are subject to various united states and international laws and regulations relating to environmental protection under such laws and regulations we are prohibited from among other things discharging certain materials such as petrochemicals and plastics into the waterways we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations from time to time environmental and other regulators consider more stringent regulations which may affect our operations and increase our compliance costs we believe that the impact of ships on the global environment will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world and accordingly may subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future including the items described below 

our ships are subject to the international maritime organization’s ‘‘imo’’ regulations under the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships the ‘‘marpol regulations’’ which includes requirements designed to minimize pollution by oil sewage garbage and air emissions we have obtained the relevant international compliance certificates relating to oil sewage and air pollution prevention for all of our ships 

the marpol regulations impose global limitations on the sulfur content of fuel used by ships operating worldwide permitted sulfur content was reduced from 45 to 35 on january 1 2012 this reduction has not had a material effect on our fuel and operating costs 

the marpol regulations also establish special emission control areas ‘‘ecas’’ with stringent limitations on sulfur and nitrogen oxide emissions in these areas as of february 2014 there are four established ecas the baltic sea the north seaenglish channel certain of the waters surrounding the north american coast and the waters surrounding puerto rico and the us virgin islands since july 1 2010 ships operating in ecas are required to operate on fuel with a sulfur content of 10 these eca sulfur content reductions have not had a material impact on our results of operations 

beginning january 1 2015 ships operating in ecas will be required to further reduce their fuel sulfur content to 01 we have been planning for this additional requirement for the last several years and continue to take steps to mitigate the potential impact on our fuel cost all of our ships on order including those for tui cruises will be built with advanced exhaust purification aep systems covering all engines as these new vessels are delivered they will provide us with additional operational and deployment flexibility 

in addition we have been actively developing and testing aep systems on our existing fleet we have received exemptions for six of our ships which will apply while they are sailing in the north american and caribbean ecas these exemptions delay the requirement to comply with the additional sulfur content reduction pending our continued development and deployment of aep systems on these ships we believe that the learning from our existing endeavors including our newbuild program as well as our further efforts with regards to this technology will allow us to execute an effective aep system strategy for our fleet 

as a result of these and other mitigating actions we believe the cost of complying with the 2015 eca sulfur emission requirement will not be significant to our results of operations in 2015 and the years following 

by january 1 2020 the marpol regulations will require the worldwide limitations on sulfur content of fuel to be further reduced to 05 if such a reduced limitation is implemented worldwide in 2020 and we have not been able to successfully mitigate the impact with evolving technical solutions our fuel costs could increase significantly 

we have also taken a number of other steps to improve the overall fuel efficiency of our fleet and accordingly reduce our fuel costs we are targeting a 25 efficiency improvement for our ships on order in addition we continue to work to improve the efficiency of our existing fleet including improvements to the propulsion machinery hvac systems and lighting the overall impact of these efforts has resulted in a 21 improvement in energy efficiency since 2005 and we believe that our energy consumption per guest is currently the lowest in the cruise industry 

in july 2011 new marpol regulations introduced mandatory measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions these include the utilization of an energy efficiency design index eedi for new ships as well as the establishment of an energy efficient management plan for all ships the eedi is a performancebased mechanism that requires a certain minimum energy efficiency in new ships these regulations apply to new vessels commissioned after january 1 2013 compliance with these regulations has not had a material effect on our operating costs in june 2013 the european commission proposed legislation which would require cruise ship operators using ports in the european union to monitor and report on the vessels’ annual carbon dioxide emissions starting in 2018 we expect that compliance with this regulation if adopted will not materially impact our results of operations 

labor regulations 

the international labour organization an agency of the united nations that develops worldwide employment standards has adopted a new consolidated maritime labour convention the “convention” which became effective in august 2013 the convention reflects a broad range of standards and conditions governing all aspects of crew management for ships in international commerce including additional requirements not previously in effect relating to the health safety repatriation entitlements and status of crewmembers and crew recruitment practices each of our ships has received its certification of compliance with the requirements of the convention we have not incurred and do not expect to incur material costs related to implementation and ongoing compliance with the convention 

consumer financial responsibility regulations 

we are required to obtain certificates from the united states federal maritime commission relating to our ability to satisfy liability in cases of nonperformance of obligations to guests as well as casualty and personal injury as a condition to obtaining the required certificates we arrange through our insurers for the provision of surety for three of our shipoperating companies the required surety amount is currently 150 million per operator however under amendments approved in february 2013 the required amount will increase to 220 million and 300 million per operator in 2014 and 2015 respectively once fully phasedin in 2015 these surety requirements will be subject to additional consumer price index based adjustments we do not anticipate that compliance with the new rules will have a material effect on our costs 

we are also required by the united kingdom norway finland and the baltics to establish our financial responsibility for any liability resulting from the nonperformance of our obligations to guests from these jurisdictions in the united kingdom we are currently required by the association of british travel agents to provide performance bonds totaling approximately £315 million the norwegian travel guarantee fund requires us to maintain performance bonds in varying amounts during the course of the year to cover our financial responsibility in norway finland and the baltics these amounts ranged from nok 28 million to nok 67 million during 2013 

certain other jurisdictions also require that we establish financial responsibility to our guests resulting from the nonperformance of our obligations however the related amounts do not have a material effect on our costs 

  regulations regarding protection of disabled persons 

in june 2013 the us architectural and transportation barriers compliance board proposed guidelines for the construction and alteration of passenger vessels to ensure that the vessels are readily accessible to and usable by passengers with disabilities once finalized these guidelines will be used by the us department of transportation and us department of justice to implement mandatory and enforceable standards for passenger vessels covered by the americans with disabilities act while we believe our vessels have been designed and outfitted to meet the needs of our guests with disabilities we cannot at this time accurately predict whether we will be required to make material modifications or incur significant additional expenses given the preliminary status of the proposed guidelines 

taxation of the company 

the following is a summary of our principal taxes exemptions and special regimes in addition to or instead of income taxation virtually all jurisdictions where our ships call impose some tax or fee or both based on guest headcount tonnage or some other measure 

we are primarily foreign corporations engaged in the owning and operating of passenger cruise ships in international transportation during 2013 we also operated other businesses primarily consisting of the pullmantur landtour and air business 

united states income taxation 

the following is a discussion of the application of the united states federal and state income tax laws to us and is based on the current provisions of the united states internal revenue code treasury department regulations administrative rulings court decisions and the relevant state tax laws regulations rulings and court decisions of the states where we have business operations all of the foregoing is subject to change and any such change could affect the accuracy of this discussion 

application of section 883 of the internal revenue code 

we and celebrity cruises inc are engaged in a trade or business in the united states and many of our shipowning subsidiaries depending upon the itineraries of their ships receive income from sources within the united 

states additionally our united kingdom tonnage tax company owned by us and celebrity cruises inc is a shipoperating company classified as a partnership for united states federal income tax purposes that may earn united states source income under section 883 of the internal revenue code certain foreign corporations are not subject to united states federal income or branch profits tax on united states source income derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships including income from the leasing of such ships 

a foreign corporation will qualify for the benefits of section 883 if in relevant part 1 the foreign country in which the foreign corporation is organized grants an equivalent exemption to corporations organized in the united states and 2 the stock of the corporation or the direct or indirect corporate parent thereof is “primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market” in the united states or another qualifying country such as norway in the opinion of our united states tax counsel drinker biddle  reath llp based on the representations and assumptions set forth in that opinion we celebrity cruises inc and our shipowning subsidiaries qualify for the benefits of section 883 because we and each of those subsidiaries are incorporated in liberia or malta which are qualifying countries and our common stock is primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market in the united states or norway ie we are a publicly traded corporation if in the future 1 liberia or malta no longer qualifies as an equivalent exemption jurisdiction and we do not reincorporate in a jurisdiction that does qualify for the exemption or 2 we fail to qualify as a publicly traded corporation we and all of our shipowning or operating subsidiaries that rely on section 883 for tax exemption on qualifying income would be subject to united states federal income tax on their united states source shipping income and income from activities incidental thereto 

we believe that most of our income and the income of our shipowning subsidiaries is derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships and therefore is exempt from taxation under section 883 additionally income earned through a partnership will qualify as income derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships to the same extent as the income would so qualify if earned directly by the partners thus we believe that united states source income derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships earned by the united kingdom tonnage tax company will qualify for exemption under section 883 to the same extent as if it were earned directly by the owners of the united kingdom tonnage tax company 

regulations under section 883 list activities that are not considered by the internal revenue service to be incidental to the international operation of ships including the sale of air and land transportation shore excursions and pre and postcruise tours our income from these activities that is earned from sources within the united states will be subject to united states taxation 

taxation in the absence of an exemption under section 883 

if we the operator of our vessels celebrity cruises inc or our shipowning subsidiaries were to fail to meet the requirements of section 883 of the internal revenue code or if the provision was repealed then as explained below such companies would be subject to united states income taxation on a portion of their income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships 

because we and celebrity cruises inc conduct a trade or business in the united states we and celebrity cruises inc would be taxable at regular corporate rates on our separate company taxable income ie without regard to the income of our shipowning subsidiaries from united states sources in addition if any of our earnings and profits effectively connected with our united states trade or business were withdrawn or were deemed to have been withdrawn from our united states trade or business those withdrawn amounts would be subject to a “branch profits” tax at the rate of 30 we and celebrity cruises inc would also be potentially subject to tax on portions of certain interest paid by us at rates of up to 30 

if section 883 were not available to our shipowning subsidiaries each such subsidiary would be subject to a special 4 tax on its united states source gross transportation income if any each year because it does not have a fixed place of business in the united states and its income is derived from the leasing of a ship 

other united states taxation 

we and celebrity cruises inc earn united states source income from activities not considered incidental to international shipping the tax on such income is not material to our results of operation for all years presented 

state taxation 

we celebrity cruises inc and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various united states state income taxes which are generally imposed on each state’s portion of the united states source income subject to federal income taxes additionally the state of alaska subjects an allocated portion of the total income of companies doing business in alaska and certain other affiliated companies to alaska corporate state income taxes and also imposes a 33 tax on adjusted gross income from onboard gambling activities conducted in alaska waters this did not have a material impact to our results of operations for all years presented 

maltese and spanish income tax 

our pullmantur ship owneroperator subsidiaries which include the owneroperator of cdf croisières de france’s ship qualify as licensed shipping organizations in malta no maltese income tax is charged on the income derived from shipping activities of a licensed shipping organization instead a licensed shipping organization is liable to pay a tonnage tax based on the net tonnage of the ship or ships registered under the relevant provisions of the merchant shipping act a company qualifies as a shipping organization if it engages in qualifying activities and it obtains a license from the registrargeneral to enable it to carry on such activities qualifying activities include but are not limited to the ownership operation under charter or otherwise administration and management of a ship or ships registered as a maltese ship in terms of the merchant shipping act and the carrying on of all ancillary financial security and commercial activities in connection therewith 

our maltese operations that do not qualify as licensed shipping organizations which are not considered significant remain subject to normal maltese corporate income tax 

pullmantur has sales and marketing functions landbased tour operations and air business in spain these activities are subject to spanish taxation the tax from these operations is not considered significant to our operations as a result of pullmanturs increased focus in latin america and need to have operating management closer to its largest and fastest growing market pullmantur has opened a regional head office in panama this office has been formed as a sedes de empresas multinacionales sem otherwise known in panama as a multinational headquarters company the sem regime provides tax advantages for panamanian entities that only carry out transactions with other entities belonging to their same international group this new company is expected to be exempt from panamanian taxation 

united kingdom income tax 

we operate thirteen ships under companies which have elected to be subject to the united kingdom tonnage tax regime “uk tonnage tax” 

companies subject to uk tonnage tax pay a corporate tax on a notional profit determined with reference to the net tonnage of qualifying vessels normal united kingdom corporate income tax is not chargeable on the relevant shipping profits of a qualifying uk tonnage tax company the requirements for a company to qualify for the uk tonnage tax regime include being subject to united kingdom corporate income tax operating qualifying ships which are strategically and commercially managed in the united kingdom and fulfilling a seafarer training requirement 

failure to meet any of these requirements could cause us to lose the benefit of the tonnage tax regime which will have a material effect on our results of operations 

relevant shipping profits include income from the operation of qualifying ships and from shipping related activities our united kingdom income from nonshipping activities which do not qualify under the uk tonnage tax regime and which are not considered significant remain subject to united kingdom corporate income tax 

brazilian income tax 

pullmantur and our uk tonnage tax company charters certain ships to brazilian companies for operations in brazil from november to may some of these charters are with unrelated third parties and others are with a brazilian affiliate the brazilian affiliate’s earnings are subject to brazilian taxation which is not considered significant the charter payments made to the uk tonnage tax company and to pullmantur are exempt from brazilian income tax under current brazilian domestic law 

   other taxation 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to income tax in other jurisdictions on income that does not qualify for exemption or tonnage tax regimes the tax on such income was not material to our results of operations for all years presented our uk tonnage tax companies are exempt from some taxation in certain jurisdictions where those companies have business operations under relevant united kingdom tax treaties cdf croisières de france’s operations within france are minimal and therefore its french income taxes are minimal

the demand for cruises is affected by international national and local economic and geopolitical conditions in recent years we have been faced with very challenging global economic conditions which have adversely affected vacationers’ discretionary income and consumer confidence this in turn resulted in cruise booking slowdowns decreased cruise prices and lower onboard revenues for us and for others in the cruise industry as compared to more robust economic times although the cruise industry continued to recover in 2013 recovery remains slow in certain key markets including southern europe and has been hindered in some other markets by ongoing economic instability we cannot predict with any certainty whether demand for cruises will continue to improve or the rate of such improvement in addition any significant deterioration of global economic conditions could result in a prolonged period of booking slowdowns depressed cruise prices and reduced onboard revenues demand for our cruises is also influenced by geopolitical events unfavorable conditions such as crossborder conflicts civil unrest and governmental changes especially in regions with popular ports of call can undermine consumer demand andor pricing for itineraries featuring these ports 

continued unrest and economic instability could materially adversely impact our operating results cash flows and financial condition including potentially impairing the value of our ships goodwill and other assets during 2012 we recognized material impairment related charges associated with our pullmantur brand despite these charges if the economies where pullmantur operates perform worse than contemplated in our discounted cash flow model or if there are relatively modest changes to the projected future cash flows used in the impairment analyses especially in net yields or if certain transfers of vessels from our other cruise brands to the pullmantur fleet do not take place it is reasonably possible that an additional impairment charge of the pullmantur reporting unit’s goodwill and trademarks and trade names may be required 

we may not be able to obtain sufficient financing or capital for our needs or may not be able to do so on terms that are acceptable or consistent with our expectations 

to fund our capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments we have historically relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations drawdowns under available credit facilities the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the sale of equity or debt securities in private or public securities markets any circumstance or event which leads to a decrease in consumer cruise spending such as worsening global economic conditions or significant incidents impacting the cruise industry could negatively affect our operating cash flows see “ adverse worldwide economic geopolitical or other conditions… ” and “ incidents or adverse publicity concerning the cruise vacation industry…” for more information 

although we believe we can access sufficient liquidity to fund our operations and obligations as expected there can be no assurances to that effect our ability to access additional funding as and when needed our ability to timely refinance andor replace our outstanding debt securities and credit facilities on acceptable terms and our cost of funding will depend upon numerous factors including but not limited to the vibrancy of the financial markets our financial performance and credit ratings and the performance of our industry in general 

our inability to satisfy the covenants required by our credit facilities could adversely impact our liquidity 

our debt agreements contain covenants including covenants restricting our ability to take certain actions and financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum net worth and fixed charge coverage ratios and limit our net debttocapital ratio our ability to comply with the terms of our outstanding facilities may be affected by general economic conditions industry conditions and other events some of which may be beyond our control in addition our ability to make borrowings under our available credit facilities is subject to the absence of material adverse changes in our business our ability to maintain our credit facilities may also be impacted by changes in our ownership base more specifically we may be required to prepay a majority of our debt facilities if i any person or entity other than a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates and their respective affiliates the “applicable group” acquires ownership of more than 33 of our common stock and the applicable group owns less of our common stock than such person or ii subject to certain exceptions during any 24month period a majority of the board is no longer comprised of individuals who were members of the board on the first day of such period certain of our outstanding debt securities also contain change of control provisions that would be triggered by the acquisition of greater than 50 of our common stock by a person other than a member of the applicable group coupled with a ratings downgrade 

our failure to comply with the terms of our debt facilities could result in an event of default generally if an event of default under any debt agreement occurs then pursuant to cross default acceleration clauses our outstanding debt and derivative contract payables could become due andor terminated we cannot provide assurances that we would have sufficient liquidity to repay or the ability to refinance the borrowings under any of the credit facilities or settle other outstanding contracts if such amounts were accelerated upon an event of default 

in addition under several of our agreements with credit card processors that accept credit cards for the sale of cruises and other services the credit card processor may hold back a reserve from our credit card receivables following the occurrence of certain events including a default under our major credit facilities as of december 31 2013 we were not required to maintain any reserve under such agreements 

incidents or adverse publicity concerning the cruise vacation industry unusual weather conditions and other natural disasters or disruptions could affect our reputation as well as impact our sales and results of operations 

the operation of cruise ships airplanes land tours port facilities and shore excursions involves the risk of accidents illnesses mechanical failures environmental incidents and other incidents which may bring into question safety health security and vacation satisfaction which could negatively impact our reputation incidents involving cruise ships and in particular the safety and security of guests and crew media coverage thereof as well as adverse media publicity concerning the cruise vacation industry have impacted and could in the future impact demand for our cruises and pricing in the industry the considerable expansion in the use of social media over recent years has compounded the potential scope of the negative publicity that could be generated by those incidents if any such incident occurs during a time of high seasonal demand the effect could disproportionately impact our results of operations for the year in addition incidents involving cruise ships may result in additional costs to our business increasing government or other regulatory oversight and in the case of incidents involving our ships potential litigation 

our cruise ships and port facilities may also be adversely impacted by unusual weather patterns or natural disasters or disruptions such as hurricanes and earthquakes it is possible that we could be forced to alter itineraries or cancel a cruise or a series of cruises due to these or other factors which would have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability in addition these and any other events which impact the travel industry more generally may negatively impact our ability to deliver guests or crew to our cruises andor interrupt our ability to obtain services and goods from key vendors in our supply chain any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and on industry performance 

the impact of disruptions in the global financial markets may affect the ability of our counterparties and others to perform their obligations to us 

the financial crisis of 2008 including failures of financial service and insurance companies and the related liquidity crisis disrupted the capital and credit markets a recurrence of these or similar disruptions could cause our 

counterparties and others to breach their obligations to us under our contracts with them this could include failures of banks or other financial service companies to fund required borrowings under our loan agreements or to pay us amounts that may become due under our derivative contracts for hedging of fuel prices interest rates and foreign currencies or other agreements if any of the foregoing occurs it may have a negative impact on our cash flows including our ability to meet our obligations our results of operations and our financial condition 

an increase in capacity worldwide or excess capacity in a particular market could adversely impact our cruise sales andor pricing 

although our ships can be redeployed cruise sales andor pricing may be impacted both by the introduction of new ships into the marketplace and by deployment decisions of ourselves and our competitors a total of 26 new ships with approximately 71000 berths are on order for delivery through 2018 in the cruise industry the further growth in capacity from these new ships and future orders without an increase in the cruise industry’s share of the vacation market could depress cruise prices and impede our ability to achieve yield improvement in addition to the extent that we or our competitors deploy ships to a particular itinerary and the resulting capacity in that region exceeds the demand we may lower pricing and profitability may be lower than anticipated any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition including potentially impairing the value of our ships goodwill and other assets 

if we are unable to appropriately balance our cost management strategies with our goal of satisfying guest expectations it may adversely impact our business success 

our goals call for us to provide high quality products and deliver high quality services there can be no assurances that we can successfully balance these goals with our cost management strategies 

we may lose business to competitors throughout the vacation market    

we operate in the vacation market and cruising is one of many alternatives for people choosing a vacation we therefore risk losing business not only to other cruise lines but also to other vacation operators which provide other leisure options including hotels resorts and package holidays and tours 

we face significant competition from other cruise lines on the basis of cruise pricing travel agent preference and also in terms of the nature of ships and services we offer to guests our principal competitors within the cruise vacation industry include carnival corporation  plc which owns among others aida cruises carnival cruise lines costa cruises cunard line holland america line iberocruceros po cruises and princess cruises disney cruise line msc cruises norwegian cruise line and oceania cruises 

in the event that we do not compete effectively with other vacation alternatives and cruise companies our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

fears of terrorist and pirate attacks war and other hostilities and the spread of contagious diseases could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

events such as terrorist and pirate attacks war and other hostilities and the resulting political instability travel restrictions the spread of contagious diseases and concerns over safety health and security aspects of traveling or the fear of any of the foregoing have had and could have in the future a significant adverse impact on demand and pricing in the travel and vacation industry in view of our global operations we have become susceptible to a wider range of adverse events 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our financial results 

we earn revenues pay expenses recognize assets and incur liabilities in currencies other than the us dollar including among others the british pound sterling the canadian dollar the euro the australian dollar and the brazilian real in 2013 we derived approximately 48 of revenues from operations outside the united states because our 

consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must convert revenues income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore absent offsetting changes in other foreign currencies increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against other major currencies will affect our revenues net income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies we use derivative financial instruments to mitigate our net balance sheet exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations however there can be no assurances that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly the strengthening of the us dollar against major currencies would not materially affect our financial results 

in addition we have ship construction contracts which are denominated in euros while we have entered into eurodenominated forward contracts and collar options to manage a portion of the currency risk associated with these ship construction contracts we are exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate for the portion of the ship construction contracts that has not been hedged additionally if the shipyard is unable to perform under the related ship construction contract any foreign currency hedges that were entered into to manage the currency risk would need to be terminated termination of these contracts could result in a significant loss 

environmental labor health and safety financial responsibility and other maritime regulations could affect operations and increase operating costs 

the united states and various state and foreign government or regulatory agencies have enacted or are considering new environmental regulations or policies such as requiring the use of low sulfur fuels increasing fuel efficiency requirements further restricting emissions or other initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions that could increase our cost for fuel cause us to incur significant expenses to purchase andor develop new equipment and adversely impact the cruise vacation industry some environmental groups have also lobbied for more stringent regulation of cruise ships and have generated negative publicity about the cruise vacation industry and its environmental impact see item 1 businessregulationenvironmental regulations  an increase in fuel prices not only impacts our fuel costs but also some of our other expenses such as crew travel freight and commodity prices 

in addition we are subject to various international national state and local laws regulations and treaties that govern among other things safety standards applicable to our ships treatment of disabled persons health and sanitary standards applicable to our guests security standards on board our ships and at the shipport interface areas and financial responsibilities to our guests these issues are and we believe will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world especially in light of several recent incidents involving cruise ships this could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise ships that could subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 

conducting business globally may result in increased costs and other risks 

we operate our business globally operating internationally exposes us to a number of risks including unstable local economic conditions volatile local political conditions potential changes in duties and taxes including changing interpretations of existing tax laws and regulations required compliance with additional laws and policies affecting cruising vacation or maritime businesses or governing the operations of foreignbased companies currency fluctuations interest rate movements difficulties in operating under local business environments us and global antibribery laws or regulations imposition of trade barriers and restrictions on repatriation of earnings if we are unable to address these risks adequately our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected including potentially impairing the value of our ships goodwill and other assets 

operating globally also exposes us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements in many parts of the world including countries in which we operate practices in the local business communities might not conform to international business standards we must adhere to policies designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance as well as applicable laws and regulations however we might not be successful in ensuring that our employees agents representatives and other third parties with which we associate throughout the world properly adhere to them 

failure by us our employees or any of these third parties to adhere to our policies or applicable laws or regulations could result in penalties sanctions damage to our reputation and related costs which in turn could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows 

our attempts to expand our business into new markets may not be successful 

while our historical focus has been to serve the north american cruise market we have expanded our focus to increase our international guest sourcing including sourcing from the latin american asian and australian markets in addition in early 2014 pullmantur opened a regional head office in panama expansion into new markets requires significant levels of investment there can be no assurance that these markets will develop as anticipated or that we will have success in these markets and if we do not we may be unable to recover our investment which could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations including potentially impairing the value of our goodwill 

ship construction repair or revitalization delays or mechanical faults may result in cancellation of cruises or unscheduled drydocks and repairs and thus adversely affect our results of operations 

we depend on shipyards to construct repair and revitalize our cruise ships on a timely basis and in good working order the sophisticated nature of building a ship involves risks delays in ship construction or revitalization or mechanical faults have in the past and may in the future result in delays or cancellation of cruises or necessitate unscheduled drydocks and repairs of ships these events and any related adverse publicity could result in lost revenue increased operating expenses or both and thus adversely affect our results of operations 

shipyards and their subcontractors may experience financial difficulties which could cause or result in delay ship cancellations our inability to procure new capacity in a timely fashion or increases in shipbuilding costs that could adversely affect our results of operations 

we rely on shipyards to construct repair and revitalize our ships financial difficulties liquidations or closures suffered by these shipyards andor their subcontractors may impact the timely delivery or costs of new ships or the ability of shipyards to repair and revitalize our fleet in accordance with our needs or expectations the shipyard that is building the two newbuilds for our tui cruises joint venture continues to experience financial difficulties this situation could have a material impact on the ability of the shipyard to deliver these ships in accordance with the terms of the contract the costs borne by tui cruises associated with these ships andor the additional financial support that we may need to provide to tui cruises eg parent guarantees loans additional equity contributions or that tui cruises may need to provide to the shipyard to seek to ensure timely completion 

in addition there are a limited number of shipyards with the capability and capacity to build our new ships and accordingly closures or consolidation in the cruise shipyard industry could impact our ability to construct new ships when and as planned andor could result in stronger bargaining power on the part of the shipyards and thus higher prices for our future ship orders delivery delays and canceled deliveries can adversely affect our results of operations as can any constraints on our ability to build repair and maintain our ships on a timely basis 

our operating costs especially fuel expenditures could increase due to market forces and economic or geo political factors beyond our control 

expenditures for fuel represent a significant cost of operating our business if fuel prices rise significantly in a short period of time we may be unable to increase fares or other fees sufficiently to offset fully our increased fuel costs we routinely hedge a portion of our future fuel requirements to protect against rising fuel costs however there can be no assurance that our hedge contracts will provide a sufficient level of protection against increased fuel costs or that our counterparties will be able to perform under our hedge contracts such as in the case of a counterparty’s bankruptcy further volatility in fuel prices or disruptions in fuel supplies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

our other operating costs including food payroll airfare taxes insurance and security costs are all subject to increases due to market forces and economic or political conditions or other factors beyond our control increases in these operating costs could adversely affect our profitability 

unavailability of ports of call may adversely affect our results of operations    

we believe that port destinations are a major reason why guests choose to go on a particular cruise or on a cruise vacation the availability of ports is affected by a number of factors including existing capacity constraints constraints related to the size of certain ships security concerns adverse weather conditions and natural disasters financial limitations on port development exclusivity arrangements that ports may have with our competitors local governmental regulations and local community concerns about port development and other adverse impacts on their communities from additional tourists in addition rising fuel costs may adversely impact the destinations on certain of our itineraries any limitations on the availability or feasibility of our ports of call or on the availability of shore excursion and other service providers at such ports could adversely affect our results of operations 

price increases for commercial airline service for our guests or major changes or reduction in commercial airline service andor availability could adversely impact the demand for cruises and undermine our ability to provide reasonably priced vacation packages to our guests 

many of our guests depend on scheduled commercial airline services to transport them to or from the ports where our cruises embark or disembark increases in the price of airfare would increase the overall price of the cruise vacation to our guests which may adversely impact demand for our cruises in addition changes in the availability of commercial airline services could adversely affect our guests’ ability to obtain airfare as well as our ability to fly our guests to or from our cruise ships which could adversely affect our results of operations 

our reliance on travel agencies to sell and market our cruises exposes us to certain risks which if realized could adversely impact our business 

because we rely on travel agencies to generate the majority of bookings for our ships we must ensure that our commission rates and incentive structures remain competitive if we fail to offer competitive compensation packages these agencies may be incentivized to sell cruises offered by our competitors to our detriment which could adversely impact our operating results in addition the travel agent industry is sensitive to economic conditions that impact discretionary income significant disruptions especially disruptions impacting those agencies that sell a high volume of our business or contractions in the industry could reduce the number of travel agencies available for us to market and sell our cruises which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

disruptions in our shoreside operations or our information systems may adversely affect our results of operations 

our principal executive office and principal shoreside operations are located at the port of miami florida and we have shoreside offices throughout the world actual or threatened natural disasters eg hurricanes earthquakes tornadoes fires floods or similar events in these locations may have a material impact on our business continuity reputation and results of operations in addition substantial or repeated information systems failures computer viruses or cyberattacks impacting our shoreside or shipboard operations could adversely impact our business we do not generally carry business interruption insurance for our shoreside operations or our information systems as such any losses or damages incurred by us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

failure to develop the value of our brands and differentiate our products could adversely affect our results of operations 

our success depends on the strength and continued development of our cruise brands and on the effectiveness of our brand strategies failure to protect and differentiate our brands from competitors throughout the vacation market could adversely affect our results of operations 

the loss of key personnel our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel or disruptions among our shipboard personnel due to strained employee relations could adversely affect our results of operations 

our success depends in large part on the skills and contributions of key executives and other employees and on our ability to recruit and retain high quality personnel we must continue to sufficiently recruit retain train and motivate our employees to maintain our current business and support our projected growth furthermore as of december 31 2013  80 of our shipboard employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements a dispute under our collective bargaining agreements could result in a work stoppage of those employees covered by the agreements a loss of key employees or disruptions among our personnel could adversely affect our results of operations 

business activities that involve our coinvestment with third parties may subject us to additional risks 

partnerships joint ventures and other business structures involving our coinvestment with third parties such as our joint venture to operate tui cruises generally include some form of shared control over the operations of the business and create additional risks including the possibility that other investors in such ventures could become bankrupt or otherwise lack the financial resources to meet their obligations or could have or develop business interests policies or objectives that are inconsistent with ours in addition actions by another investor may present additional risks of operational difficulties or reputational or legal concerns these or other issues related to our coinvestment with third parties could adversely impact our operations 

we rely on thirdparty providers of various services integral to the operations of our businesses these third parties may act in ways that could harm our business 

in order to achieve cost and operational efficiencies we outsource to thirdparty vendors certain services that are integral to the operations of our global businesses such as our onboard concessionaires certain of our call center operations and operation of a large part of our information technology systems we are subject to the risk that certain decisions are subject to the control of our thirdparty service providers and that these decisions may adversely affect our activities a failure to adequately monitor a thirdparty service provider’s compliance with a service level agreement or regulatory or legal requirements could result in significant economic and reputational harm to us there is also a risk the confidentiality privacy andor security of data held by third parties or communicated over thirdparty networks or platforms could become compromised 

a failure to keep pace with developments in technology or technological obsolescence could impair our operations or competitive position 

our business continues to demand the use of sophisticated technology and systems these technologies and systems must be refined updated andor replaced with more advanced systems in order to continue to meet our customers’ demands and expectations if we are unable to do so in a timely manner or within reasonable cost parameters or if we are unable to appropriately and timely train our employees to operate any of these new systems our business could suffer we also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new technology or system and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could impair our operating results 

we may be exposed to risks and costs associated with protecting the integrity and security of our guests’ and employees’ personal information 

we are subject to various risks associated with the collection handling storage and transmission of sensitive information including risks related to compliance with applicable laws and other contractual obligations as well as the risk that our systems collecting such information could be compromised in the course of doing business we collect large volumes of internal and customer data including personally identifiable information for various business purposes if we fail to maintain compliance with the various applicable data collection and privacy laws or with credit card industry standards or other applicable data security standards we could be exposed to fines penalties restrictions litigation or other expenses and our business could be adversely impacted in addition even if we are fully compliant with legal standards and contractual requirements we still may not be able to prevent security breaches involving sensitive data any breach theft loss or fraudulent use of guest employee or company data could cause consumers 

to lose confidence in the security of our information technology systems and choose not to purchase from us and expose us to risks of data loss business disruption litigation and other liability any of which could adversely affect our business 

a change in our tax status under the united states internal revenue code or other jurisdictions may have adverse effects on our income  

we and a number of our subsidiaries are foreign corporations that derive income from a united states trade or business andor from sources within the united states drinker biddle  reath llp our united states tax counsel has delivered to us an opinion based on certain representations and assumptions set forth in it to the effect that this income to the extent derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships is exempt from united states federal income tax pursuant to section 883 of the internal revenue code we believe that most of our income including that of our subsidiaries is derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships 

our ability to rely on section 883 could change in the future for example us tax legislation has been proposed that would eliminate the availability of section 883 to us and would thereby cause a portion of our international shipping income to be subject to tax in the united states     moreover changes could occur in the future with respect to the identity residence or holdings of our direct or indirect shareholders trading volume or trading frequency of our shares or relevant foreign tax laws of liberia or malta such that they no longer qualify as equivalent exemption jurisdictions that could affect our eligibility for the section 883 exemption accordingly there can be no assurance that we will continue to be exempt from united states income tax on united states source shipping income in the future if we were not entitled to the benefit of section 883 we and our subsidiaries would be subject to united states taxation on a portion of the income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships which would reduce our net income 

additionally portions of our business are operated by companies that are within tonnage tax regimes of the uk and malta further some of the operations of these companies are conducted in jurisdictions where we rely on tax treaties to provide exemption from taxation to the extent the tonnage tax laws of these countries change or we do not continue to meet the applicable qualification requirements or if tax treaties are changed or revoked we may be required to pay higher income tax in these jurisdictions adversely impacting our results of operations 

as budgetary constraints continue to adversely impact the jurisdictions in which we operate increases in income tax regulations or tax reform affecting our operations may be imposed 

we are not a united states corporation and our shareholders may be subject to the uncertainties of a foreign legal system in protecting their interests 

our corporate affairs are governed by our articles of incorporation and bylaws and by the business corporation act of liberia the provisions of the business corporation act of liberia resemble provisions of the corporation laws of a number of states in the united states however while most states have a fairly well developed body of case law interpreting their respective corporate statutes there are very few judicial cases in liberia interpreting the business corporation act of liberia as such the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under liberian law are not as clearly established as the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in certain united states jurisdictions for example the right of shareholders to bring a derivative action in liberian courts may be more limited than in united states jurisdictions there may also be practical difficulties for shareholders attempting to bring suit in liberia and liberian courts may or may not recognize and enforce foreign judgments thus our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests with respect to actions by management directors or controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a united states jurisdiction 

litigation enforcement actions fines or penalties could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations andor damage our reputation 

our business is subject to various united states and international laws and regulations that could lead to enforcement actions fines civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims and damages in addition improper conduct by our employees agents or joint venture partners could damage our reputation andor lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties including substantial monetary fines in certain circumstances it may not be economical to defend against such matters andor a legal strategy may not ultimately result in us prevailing in a matter such events could lead to an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

provisions of our articles of incorporation bylaws and liberian law could inhibit others from acquiring us prevent a change of control and may prevent efforts by our shareholders to change our management 

certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and liberian law may inhibit third parties from effectuating a change of control of the company without board approval which could result in the entrenchment of current management these include provisions in our articles of incorporation that prevent third parties other than a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates from acquiring beneficial ownership of more than 49 of our outstanding shares without the consent of our board of directors

 item 3 legal proceedings 

a class action complaint was filed in june 2011 against royal caribbean cruises ltd in the united states district court for the southern district of florida on behalf of a purported class of stateroom attendants employed onboard royal caribbean international cruise vessels alleging that they were required to pay other crew members to help with their duties in violation of the us seaman’s wage act plaintiffs seek judgments for damages wage penalties and interest in an indeterminate amount in may 2012 the court granted our motion to dismiss the complaint on the basis that the applicable collective bargaining agreement requires any such claims to be arbitrated the united states court of appeals 11th circuit affirmed the courts dismissal and denied plaintiffs petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc we believe the underlying claims made against us are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against them because of the inherent uncertainty as to the outcome of this proceeding we are unable at this time to estimate the possible impact of this matter on us 

we are routinely involved in other claims typical within the cruise vacation industry the majority of these claims are covered by insurance we believe the outcome of such claims net of expected insurance recoveries will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations and cash flows

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap see note 1 general  and note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  certain of our accounting policies are deemed critical as they require managements highest degree of judgment estimates and assumptions we have discussed these accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors we believe our most critical accounting policies are as follows 

ship accounting 

our ships represent our most significant assets and are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization depreciation of ships is generally computed net of a 15 projected residual value using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of the asset which is generally 30 years the 30year useful life of our newly constructed ships and 15 associated residual value are both based on the weightedaverage of all major components 

of a ship our useful life and residual value estimates take into consideration the impact of anticipated technological changes longterm cruise and vacation market conditions and historical useful lives of similarlybuilt ships in addition we take into consideration our estimates of the weightedaverage useful lives of the ships major component systems such as hull superstructure main electric engines and cabins given the very large and complex nature of our ships our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain we do not have cost segregation studies performed to specifically componentize our ship systems therefore we estimate the costs of component systems based principally on general and technical information known about major ship component systems and their lives and our knowledge of the cruise vacation industry we do not identify and track depreciation by ship component systems but instead utilize these estimates to determine the net cost basis of assets replaced or refurbished improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized as additions to the ship and depreciated over the shorter of the improvements estimated useful lives or that of the associated ship the estimated cost and accumulated depreciation of replaced or refurbished ship components are written off and any resulting losses are recognized in cruise operating expenses 

during the first quarter of 2013 we performed a review of the estimated useful lives and associated residual values of ships in our fleet approaching the last third of their estimated useful lives as a result effective january 1 2013 we revised the estimated useful lives of five ships from 30 years with a 15 associated residual value to 35 years with a 10 associated residual value the change in the estimated useful lives and associated residual value was accounted for prospectively as a change in accounting estimate the 35year useful life with a 10 associated residual value is based on revised estimates of the weightedaverage useful life of all major ship components for these ships the change in estimate is consistent with our recent investments in and future plans to continue to invest in the revitalizations of these ships and the use of certain ship components longer than originally estimated the change allows us to better match depreciation expense with the periods these assets are expected to be in use see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

we use the deferral method to account for drydocking costs under the deferral method drydocking costs incurred are deferred and charged to expense on a straightline basis over the period to the next scheduled drydock which we estimate to be a period of thirty to sixty months based on the vessels age as required by class deferred drydock costs consist of the costs to drydock the vessel and other costs incurred in connection with the drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessels class certification class certification is necessary in order for our cruise ships to be flagged in a specific country obtain liability insurance and legally operate as passenger cruise ships the activities associated with those drydocking costs cannot be performed while the vessel is in service and as such are done during a drydock as a planned major maintenance activity the significant deferred drydock costs consist of hauling and wharfage services provided by the drydock facility hull inspection and related activities eg scraping pressure cleaning bottom painting maintenance to steering propulsion thruster equipment and ballast tanks port services such as tugs pilotage and line handling and freight associated with these items we perform a detailed analysis of the various activities performed for each drydock and only defer those costs that are directly related to planned major maintenance activities necessary to maintain class the costs deferred are related to activities not otherwise routinely periodically performed to maintain a vessels designed and intended operating capability repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred 

we use judgment when estimating the period between drydocks which can result in adjustments to the estimated amortization of drydock costs if the vessel is disposed of before the next drydock the remaining balance in deferred drydock is writtenoff to the gain or loss upon disposal of vessel in the period in which the sale takes place we also use judgment when identifying costs incurred during a drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessels class certification as compared to those costs attributable to repairs and maintenance which are expensed as incurred see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

we believe we have made reasonable estimates for ship accounting purposes however should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimates of ship useful lives or projected residual values depreciation expense could be materially higher or lower if circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making determinations as to whether ship improvements should be capitalized the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance costs could increase partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense if we had reduced our estimated average 

30year ship useful life by one year depreciation expense for 2013  would have increased by approximately 426 million if our ships were estimated to have no residual value depreciation expense for 2013  would have increased by approximately 1682 million 

valuation of goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets and longlived assets 

we review goodwill trademarks and trade names which are our most significant indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or when events or circumstances dictate more frequently the impairment review for goodwill consists of a qualitative assessment of whether it is morelikelythannot that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount and if necessary a twostep goodwill impairment test factors to consider when performing the qualitative assessment include general economic conditions limitations on accessing capital changes in forecasted operating results changes in fuel prices and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates if the qualitative assessment demonstrates that it is morelikelythannot that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value it is not necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to step one for any reporting unit in any period we can resume the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any subsequent period 

when performing the twostep goodwill impairment test the fair value of the reporting unit is determined and compared to the carrying value of the net assets allocated to the reporting unit we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a probabilityweighted discounted cash flow model the estimation of fair value utilizing discounted expected future cash flows includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of expected revenues operating costs marketing selling and administrative expenses interest rates ship additions and retirements as well as assumptions regarding the cruise vacation industrys competitive environment and general economic and business conditions among other factors the principal assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model are projected operating results weightedaverage cost of capital and terminal value the discounted cash flow model uses our 2014  projected operating results as a base to that base we add future years cash flows assuming multiple revenue and expense scenarios that reflect the impact of different global economic environments beyond 2014  on the reporting unit we discount the projected cash flows using rates specific to the reporting unit based on its weightedaverage cost of capital if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value no further analysis or writedown of goodwill is required if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of its net assets the implied fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all its underlying assets and liabilities including both recognized and unrecognized tangible and intangible assets based on their fair value if necessary goodwill is then written down to its implied fair value 

the impairment review for indefinitelife intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount we estimate the fair value of our indefinitelife intangible assets which consist of trademarks and trade names related to pullmantur using a discounted cash flow model and the relieffromroyalty method the royalty rate used is based on comparable royalty agreements in the tourism and hospitality industry the discount rate used is comparable to the rate used in valuing the pullmantur reporting unit in our goodwill impairment test if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess if the fair value exceeds its carrying amount the indefinitelife intangible asset is not considered impaired other intangible assets assigned finite useful lives are amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives 

we review our ships aircraft and other longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable we evaluate asset impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities the lowest level for which we maintain identifiable cash flows that are independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities is at the ship level for our ships and at the aggregated asset group level for our aircraft see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  if estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of an asset an impairment charge is recognized to the extent its carrying value exceeds fair value 

we estimate fair value based on quoted market prices in active markets if available if active markets are not available we base fair value on independent appraisals sales price negotiations and projected future cash flows discounted at a rate estimated by management to be commensurate with the business risk quoted market prices are 

often not available for individual reporting units and for indefinitelife intangible assets accordingly we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit and an indefinitelife intangible asset using an expected present value technique 

pullmantur 

during the fourth quarter of 2013  we performed our annual impairment review of goodwill for pullmanturs reporting unit we did not perform a qualitative assessment but instead proceeded directly to the twostep goodwill impairment test as a result of the test we determined the fair value of the pullmantur reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 8 resulting in no impairment to pullmanturs goodwill we also performed the annual impairment review of our trademarks and trade names using a discounted cash flow model and the relieffromroyalty method based on the results of our testing we did not record an impairment of pullmanturs tradenames and trademarks for the year ended december 31 2013 

during the fourth quarter of 2012 we performed the annual impairment evaluation of our goodwill and trademarks and trade names and we recognized total impairment related charges of 4139 million  associated with our pullmantur brand included in this amount was a 100 valuation allowance of our deferred tax assets which resulted in a deferred income tax expense of 337 million  recorded during the fourth quarter of 2012 in addition pullmantur has a deferred tax liability that was recorded at the time of acquisition this liability represents the tax effect of the basis difference between the tax and book values of the trademarks and trade names that were acquired at the time of the acquisition due to the 2012 impairment charge related to these intangible assets we reduced the deferred tax liability and recorded a deferred tax benefit of 52 million  during the fourth quarter of 2012 the net 285 million  impact of these adjustments was recognized in earnings during the fourth quarter of 2012 and was reported within other expense income  in our statements of comprehensive income loss 

in connection with the december 2013 agreement to sell a majority stake in pullmantur’s noncore businesses we have agreed to retain certain longlived assets consisting of the aircraft owned and operated by pullmantur air due to an anticipated change in the nature of the cash flows to be generated by the pullmantur aircraft we reviewed the aircraft for impairment we identified that the undiscounted future cash flows of the aircraft were less than their carrying value and recorded an impairment charge of 135 million  during the fourth quarter of 2013 which is reported in restructuring and related impairment charges  in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss 

pullmantur is a brand targeted primarily at the spanish portuguese and latin american markets with an increasing focus on latin america the persistent economic instability in these markets has created significant uncertainties in forecasting operating results and future cash flows used in our impairment analyses we continue to monitor economic events in these markets for their potential impact on pullmantur’s business and valuation further the estimation of fair value utilizing discounted expected future cash flows includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of expected revenues operating costs marketing selling and administrative expenses interest rates ship additions and retirements as well as assumptions regarding the cruise vacation industrys competitive environment and general economic and business conditions among other factors the opening of a regional head office in latin america was a significant factor in shaping these assumptions 

if there are relatively modest changes to the projected future cash flows used in the impairment analyses especially in net yields or if certain transfers of vessels from our other cruise brands to the pullmantur fleet do not take place it is reasonably possible that an impairment charge of pullmantur’s reporting unit’s goodwill and trademark and trade names may be required of these factors the planned transfers of vessels to the pullmantur fleet is most significant to the projected future cash flows if the transfers do not occur we will likely fail step one of the impairment test as of december 31 2013  the carrying amount of goodwill attributable to our pullmantur reporting unit was 1521 million  

royal caribbean international 

during the fourth quarter of 2013  we performed a qualitative assessment of the royal caribbean international reporting unit based on our qualitative assessment we concluded that it was morelikelythannot that the estimated fair value of the royal caribbean international reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and thus we did not proceed to the twostep goodwill impairment test no indicators of impairment exist primarily because the reporting units fair value has consistently exceeded its carrying value by a significant margin its financial performance has been solid in 

the face of mixed economic environments and forecasts of operating results generated by the reporting unit appear sufficient to support its carrying value as of december 31 2013  the carrying amount of goodwill attributable to our royal caribbean international reporting unit was 2871 million  

derivative instruments 

we enter into various forward swap and option contracts to manage our interest rate exposure and to limit our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices these instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value and the vast majority are designated as hedges we also have nonderivative financial instruments designated as hedges of our net investment in our foreign operations and investments the fuel options we entered into represent economic hedges which were not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes and thus changes in their fair value were immediately recognized in earnings although certain of our derivative financial instruments do not qualify or are not accounted for under hedge accounting we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes we account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with authoritative guidance refer to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  and note 14 fair value measurements and derivative instruments  to our consolidated financial statements for more information on related authoritative guidance the companys hedging programs and derivative financial instruments 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and collars interest rate crosscurrency and fuel swaps and options with third party institutions in overthecounter markets we estimate the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate and crosscurrency swaps using expected future cash flows based on the instruments contract terms and published forward curves for foreign currency exchange and interest rates we apply present value techniques and liborbased discount rates to convert the expected future cash flows to the current fair value of the instruments 

we estimate the fair value of our foreign currency collars using standard option pricing models with inputs based on the options contract terms such as exercise price and maturity and readily available public market data such as foreign exchange curves foreign exchange volatility levels and discount rates 

we estimate the fair value of our fuel swaps using expected future cash flows based on the swaps contract terms and forward prices we derive forward prices from forward fuel curves based on pricing inputs provided by thirdparty institutions that transact in the fuel indices we hedge we validate these pricing inputs against actual market transactions and published price quotes for similar assets we apply present value techniques and liborbased discount rates to convert the expected future cash flows to the current fair value of the instruments we also corroborate our fair value estimates using valuations provided by our counterparties 

we estimate the fair value for our fuel call options based on the prevailing market price for the instruments consisting of published price quotes for similar assets based on recent transactions in an active market 

we adjust the valuation of our derivative financial instruments to incorporate credit risk 

we believe it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate crosscurrency and fuel swaps and options would be derived from other appropriate valuation models using similar assumptions inputs or conditions suggested by actual historical experience 

contingencies—litigation 

on an ongoing basis we assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss if any can be made in assessing probable losses we take into consideration estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries if any which are recorded as assets when recoverability is probable we accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recoveries it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made 

seasonality 

our revenues are seasonal based on demand for cruises demand is strongest for cruises during the northern hemispheres summer months and holidays in order to mitigate the impact of the winter weather in the northern hemisphere and to capitalize on the summer season in the southern hemisphere our brands have focused on deployment to australia and latin america during that period 

financial presentation 

description of certain line items 

revenues 

our revenues are comprised of the following 

 onboard and other revenues  also include revenues we receive from independent third party concessionaires that pay us a percentage of their revenues in exchange for the right to provide selected goods andor services onboard our ships 

cruise operating expenses 

our cruise operating expenses are comprised of the following 

 we do not allocate payroll and related expenses food expenses fuel expenses or other operating expenses to the expense categories attributable to passenger ticket revenues or onboard and other revenues since they are incurred to provide the total cruise vacation experience 

selected operational and financial metrics 

we utilize a variety of operational and financial metrics which are defined below to evaluate our performance and financial condition as discussed in more detail herein certain of these metrics are nongaap financial measures which we believe provide useful information to investors as a supplement to our consolidated financial statements which are prepared and presented in accordance with gaap the presentation of nongaap financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap 

adjusted earnings per share  represents adjusted net income divided by weighted average shares outstanding or by diluted weighted average shares outstanding as applicable we believe that this nongaap measure is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis 

adjusted net income  represents net income excluding certain items that we believe adjusting for is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis in 2013 and 2012 these items include restructuring and related impairment charges and impairment of pullmantur related assets respectively for comparability purposes starting in 2014 we will exclude results of the divested pullmantur noncore businesses from our adjusted net income in anticipation of the 2014 change we have presented adjusted net income excluding the estimated impact of the divested pullmantur noncore businesses in the financial tables under results of operations  the estimated impact of the divested pullmantur noncore businesses was arrived at by adjusting the net income loss of these businesses for the ownership percentage we will retain as well as for intercompany transactions that will no longer be eliminated in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss 

available passenger cruise days  apcd is our measurement of capacity and represents double occupancy per cabin multiplied by the number of cruise days for the period we use this measure to perform capacity and rate analysis to identify our main noncapacity drivers that cause our cruise revenue and expenses to vary 

gross cruise costs  represent the sum of total cruise operating expenses plus marketing selling and administrative expenses 

gross yields  represent total revenues per apcd 

net cruise costs  and net cruise costs excluding fuel  represent gross cruise costs excluding commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses and in the case of net cruise costs excluding fuel fuel expenses each of which is described above under the description of certain line items  heading in measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income we believe changes in net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance a reconciliation of historical gross cruise costs to net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel is provided below under results of operations  we have not provided a quantitative reconciliation of projected gross cruise costs to projected net cruise costs and projected net cruise costs excluding fuel due to the significant uncertainty in projecting the costs deducted to arrive at these measures accordingly we do not believe that reconciling information for such projected figures would be meaningful for comparability purposes starting in 2014 we will exclude results of the divested pullmantur noncore businesses from our net cruise costs in anticipation of the 2014 change we have presented net cruise costs excluding these pullmantur noncore businesses in the financial tables under results of operations  

net debttocapital  is a ratio which represents total longterm debt including current portion of longterm debt less cash and cash equivalents net debt divided by the sum of net debt and total shareholders equity we believe net debt and net debttocapital along with total longterm debt and shareholders equity are useful measures of our capital structure a reconciliation of historical debttocapital to net debttocapital is provided below under results of operations 

net revenues represent total revenues less commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses each of which is described above under the description of certain line items  heading for comparability purposes starting in 2014 we will exclude results of the divested pullmantur noncore businesses from our net revenues in anticipation of the 2014 change we have presented net revenues excluding these pullmantur noncore businesses in the financial tables under results of operations  

the estimated impact of the divested pullmantur noncore businesses was arrived at by adjusting net loss of these businesses for the ownership percentage we will retain as well as intercompany transactions that will no longer be eliminated in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss 

net yields  represent net revenues per apcd we utilize net revenues and net yields to manage our business on a daytoday basis as we believe that it is the most relevant measure of our pricing performance because it reflects the cruise revenues earned by us net of our most significant variable costs which are commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses a reconciliation of historical gross yields to net yields is provided below under results of operations  we have not provided a quantitative reconciliation of projected gross yields to projected net yields due to the significant uncertainty in projecting the costs deducted to arrive at this measure accordingly we do not believe that reconciling information for such projected figures would be meaningful for comparability purposes starting in 2014 we will exclude results of the divested pullmantur noncore businesses from our net yields in anticipation of the 2014 change we have presented net yields excluding these pullmantur noncore businesses in the financial tables under results of operations  

occupancy  in accordance with cruise vacation industry practice is calculated by dividing passenger cruise days by apcd a percentage in excess of 100 indicates that three or more passengers occupied some cabins 

passenger cruise days  represent the number of passengers carried for the period multiplied by the number of days of their respective cruises 

we believe net yields net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel are our most relevant nongaap financial measures however a significant portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar because our reporting currency is the united states dollar the value of these revenues and expenses can be affected by changes in currency exchange rates although such changes in local currency prices is just one of many elements impacting our revenues and expenses it can be an important element for this reason we also monitor net yields net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel as if the current periods currency exchange rates had remained constant with the comparable prior periods rates or on a constant currency basis 

it should be emphasized that constant currency is primarily used for comparing shortterm changes andor projections over the longer term changes in guest sourcing and shifting the amount of purchases between currencies can significantly change the impact of the purely currencybased fluctuations 

the use of certain significant nongaap measures such as net yields net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel allow us to perform capacity and rate analysis to separate the impact of known capacity changes from other less predictable changes which affect our business we believe these nongaap measures provide expanded insight to measure revenue and cost performance in addition to the standard united states gaap based financial measures there are no specific rules or regulations for determining nongaap and constant currency measures and as such there exists the possibility that they may not be comparable to other companies within the industry 

executive overview 

we believe our results of operations for 2013 reinforce the resilience of our business and the strength of our brands despite the effect of last year’s negative industry media coverage and a slowly improving but still challenging global economy we achieved diluted adjusted earnings per share of 240 in 2013 as compared to 197 in 2012 earnings per share was 214 in 2013 compared to 008 in 2012 additionally our net income and adjusted net income for 2013 was 4737 million and 5306 million respectively and our net yields increased 27 and 32 on a constant currency basis 

our ticket and onboard revenues grew in 2013 despite our capacity remaining relatively flat strong closein demand for europe and asia drove 2013 improvement in passenger ticket revenue our global presence enables us to source guests from stronger markets in order to generate higher yields on an opportunistic basis with the ultimate goal of maximizing our longterm return on invested capital and shareholder value investments in ship revitalizations and other onboard enhancements led to onboard revenue growth in 2013 

in 2014 we will continue to focus on the development of key markets in asia and on sourcing guests and adding capacity to the markets where we expect significant growth and profitability we will also continue to invest in ship revitalizations technology and other onboard revenue initiatives which we believe will drive profitability and improve the guest experience 

our continued focus on cost control has helped us to maintain our profitability despite a tough operating environment during 2013 we incurred 569 million in restructuring and related impairment charges associated with our profitability initiatives our first initiative relates to the restructuring and consolidation of our global sales marketing general and administrative structure including the consolidation of most of our call centers located outside of the united states and the establishment of brand dedicated sales marketing and revenue management teams in key priority markets our second initiative involves strategic changes to the pullmantur brand which include the opening of a regional head office in latin america to place operating management closer to the latin american market and the sale of pullmantur’s noncruise businesses to allow pullmantur to focus on its core business we anticipate benefits as a result of the pullmantur changes to occur in 2015 and beyond we expect to incur approximately 23 million in additional restructuring and other costs in connection to both profitability initiatives in 2014 

during 2013 we ordered a third royal caribbean international quantumclass ship and the conditional agreement to construct the third royal caribbean international oasisclass ship became effective both ships are scheduled for delivery in the second quarter of 2016 we also have a second quantumclass ship on order which is expected to enter service in the second quarter of 2015 and two ships on order for our joint venture tui cruises which are scheduled for delivery in the second quarters of 2014 and 2015 each of these ships has committed financing arrangements in late 2014 we will accept delivery of the first of a new generation of royal caribbean international cruise ships quantum of the seas  

as part of our vessel revitalization program twelve ships were revitalized for the royal caribbean international brand from 2011 to 2013 to incorporate certain of the most popular features of the oasisclass ships on certain freedomclass radianceclass and visionclass ships an additional two ships are scheduled for revitalization in 2014 during 2010 the celebrity cruises brand began a revitalization program for all four milleniumclass ships to incorporate certain solsticeclass features the celebrity revitalization program was completed in 2013 

as of december 31 2013 we had liquidity of 19 billion consisting of approximately 2047 million in cash and cash equivalents and 17 billion available under our unsecured credit facilities     in 2013 we implemented a number of actions in furtherance of our refinancing strategy for our maturities in 2013 and 2014 we anticipate funding our 2014 maturities and other obligations through our cash flows from operations and our current financing arrangements in addition we continue to be focused on our goal of returning to an investment grade credit rating we have already made strides in this direction and further improvements are anticipated through increasing operating cash flow a moderate capital expenditure program retiring of debt and favorable financing programs 

results of operations 

in addition to the items discussed above under executive overview significant items for 2013  include

outlook 

we have presented the tables below excluding pullmanturs noncore businesses 

on january 27 2014  we announced the following initial first  quarter and full year 2014  guidance which remains essentially unchanged 

full year 2014   



first quarter   2014   



 adjusted earnings per share estimates for the full year and first quarter of 2014 are presented in lieu of us gaap earnings per share estimates due to significant uncertainty in projecting the amounts adjusted to arrive at this measure such as uncertainty in the amount of pullmantur noncore business results that we will absorb in 2014 refer to note 16 restructuring and related impairment charges  in our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for further information on our profitability initiatives and to the definition for adjusted earnings per share herein for the year ended december 31 2013 we incurred restructuring and related impairment charges of 569 million or 026 per share on a diluted basis 

year ended december 31 2013 compared to year ended december 31 2012 

in this section references to 2013 refer to the year ended december 31 2013 and references to 2012 refer to the year ended december 31 2012 

revenues 

total revenues for 2013 increased 2719 million or 35 to 80 billion from 77 billion in 2012 

passenger ticket revenues  comprised 719 of our 2013 total revenues passenger ticket revenues increased by 1281 million or 23 to 57 billion in 2013 from 56 billion in 2012 the increase was primarily due to 

 

 

the increase in passenger ticket revenues was partially offset by the unfavorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar of approximately 341 million 

the remaining 281 of 2013 total revenues was comprised of onboard and other revenues  which increased 1437 million or 69 to 22 billion in 2013 from 21 billion in 2012 

the increase was primarily due to 

 

 

 

cruise operating expenses 

total cruise operating expenses increased 1478 million or 29 to 53 billion from 52 billion in 2012 the increase was primarily due to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

marketing selling and administrative expenses 

marketing selling and administrative expenses  of 10 billion for 2013 remained consistent with 2012 

depreciation and amortization expenses 

depreciation and amortization expenses  for 2013 increased 242 million or 34 to 7547 million from 7305 million in 2012 the increase was primarily due to the addition of celebrity reflection  which entered service in october 2012 the increase was partially offset by the favorable effect of changes made in the first quarter of 2013 to the estimated useful lives and associated residual values for five ships of approximately 110 million 

restructuring and related impairment charges 

during 2013 we incurred restructuring charges of approximately 234 million as a result of global restructuring actions and the pending sale of pullmanturs noncore businesses in addition we recognized an impairment charge of 335 million to write down the assets held for sale related to the businesses to be sold and to write down certain longlived assets consisting of three aircraft owned and operated by pullmantur air to their fair value these impairment charges were due to the pullmantur restructuring initiative see valuation of goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets and longlived assets  above for more information regarding the impairment of these assets 

other income expense 

interest expense net of interest capitalized  decreased 234 million or 66 to 3324 million in 2013 from 3558 million in 2012 the decrease was due to lower interest rates and a lower average debt level 

extinguishment of unsecured senior notes  decreased 33 million or 440 to 42 million in 2013 compared to 75 million in 2012 the decrease is due to a lower amount of notes repurchased during 2013 partially offset by a higher premium paid in connection with the 2013 repurchases 

other expense decreased 411 million or 960 to 17 million in 2013 compared to 429 million for the same period in 2012 this change was primarily due to 

 

 

net yields

marketing selling and administrative expenses 

marketing selling and administrative expenses  for 2012 increased 509 million or 53 to 10 billion from 9606 million for 2011 the increase was due to an increase in costs associated with investments in technology and to an increase in advertising expenses related to our global expansion these increases were partially offset by the favorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our marketing selling and administrative expenses  denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar 

depreciation and amortization expenses 

depreciation and amortization expenses  for 2012 increased 281 million or 40 to 7305 million from 7024 million for 2011 the increase was primarily due to the addition of celebrity silhouette  which entered service in july 2011 the addition of celebrity reflection  which entered service in october 2012 and to new shipboard additions associated with our ship revitalization projects this increase was partially offset by the sale of celebrity mercury  to tui cruises in february 2011 

impairment of pullmantur related assets 

during 2012 we recognized an impairment charge of 3854 million to write down pullmanturs goodwill to its implied fair value and to write down trademarks and trade names and certain longlived assets consisting of three aircraft owned and operated by pullmantur air to their fair value see valuation of goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets and longlived assets  above for more information regarding the impairment of these assets 

other income expense 

interest expense net of interest capitalized  decreased to 3558 million in 2012 from 3824 million in 2011 the decrease was due to lower interest rates and a lower average debt level 

other expense  was 504 million in 2012 compared to other income  of 329 million in 2011 for a net change of 833 million when comparing these periods the change in other expense  was primarily due to the following 

 net yields 

net yields increased 15 in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due an increase in pullmanturs land based tours hotel and air packages revenue and an increase in onboard spending in addition the increase was due to the changes in our international distribution system mainly in brazil and certain deployment initiatives net yields increased 30 in 2012 compared to 2011 on a constant currency basis 

net cruise costs 

net cruise costs increased 69 in 2012 compared to 2011 due to the 14 increase in capacity and a 54 increase in net cruise cost per apcd the increase in net cruise costs per apcd was primarily due to an increase in fuel and pullmanturs landbased tours hotel and air packages expenses as discussed above in addition the increase in net cruise cost per apcd was due to the changes in our international distribution system mainly in brazil and certain deployment initiatives 

net cruise costs per apcd increased 68 in 2012 compared to 2011 on a constant currency basis net cruise costs excluding fuel per apcd increased 27 in 2012 compared to 2011 net cruise costs excluding fuel per apcd increased 42 in 2012 compared to 2011 on a constant currency basis

liquidity and capital resources 

sources and uses of cash   

cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity net cash provided by operating activities remained consistent at 14 billion the primary drivers for 2013 include a 3925 million increase in cash receipts from customer deposits and an 880 million increase in cash receipts from onboard spending mostly offset by 697 million of cash received on the settlement of derivative financial instruments in 2012 which did not recur in 2013 and the timing of payments to vendors in 2013 as compared to 2012 

net cash used in investing activities was 8245 million for 2013 compared to 13 billion for 2012 during 2013 our use of cash was primarily related to capital expenditures of 7638 million down from 13 billion for 2012 the decrease in capital expenditures is attributable to the delivery of a ship celebrity reflection  in 2012 which did not recur in 2013 partially offset by a higher level of ships under construction in 2013 compared to 2012 the decrease in capital expenditures was partially offset by investments of 706 million to our unconsolidated affiliates during 2013 in addition during 2013 we paid 173 million on settlements on our foreign currency forward contracts up from 109 million paid in 2012 

net cash used in financing activities was 5766 million for 2013 compared to 1796 million for 2012 this change was primarily due to an increase of 2952 million in repayments of debt a decrease of 1090 million in debt proceeds and an increase of 259 million paid in dividends the increase in repayments of debt was primarily due to the payment at maturity of 9000 million of unsecured senior notes partially offset by a decrease of 1700 million in repayments on unsecured revolving credit facilities a decrease in the early extinguishment of senior notes of 3197 million and the prepayment of a 1000 million unsecured term loan during 2012 the decrease in debt proceeds was primarily due to a 6500 million bond issuance and 9635 million of debt facilities being drawn upon in 2012 partially offset by 4745 million drawn upon in 2013 and an increase of 10 billion of borrowings on our revolving credit facilities in 2013 

future capital commitments 

our future capital commitments consist primarily of new ship orders as of december 31 2013  we had three quantumclass ships and one oasisclass ship on order for our royal caribbean international brand with an aggregate capacity of approximately 17850 berths 

as of december 31 2013  the aggregate cost of our ships on order was approximately 47 billion of which we had disbursed 5188 million as of such date approximately 363 of the aggregate cost was exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate at december 31 2013  see note 14 fair value measurements and derivative instruments and note 15 commitments and contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

as of december 31 2013  anticipated overall capital expenditures based on our existing ships on order are approximately 13 billion for 2014  13 billion for 2015  21 billion for 2016  and 03 billion for 2017  

contractual obligations 

as of december 31 2013  our contractual obligations were as follows in thousands 



 

 as a normal part of our business depending on market conditions pricing and our overall growth strategy we continuously consider opportunities to enter into contracts for the building of additional ships we may also consider the sale of ships or the purchase of existing ships we continuously consider potential acquisitions and strategic alliances if any of these were to occur they would be financed through the incurrence of additional indebtedness the issuance of additional shares of equity securities or through cash flows from operations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in july 2002 we entered into an operating lease denominated in british pound sterling for the brilliance of the seas  the lease payments vary based on sterling libor and are included in other operating expenses  in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss brilliance of the seas  lease expense amounts were approximately £123 million £146 million and £159 million or approximately 191 million 233 million and 256 million for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively the lease has a contractual life of 25 years however both the lessor and we have certain rights to cancel the lease at year 18 ie 2020 upon advance notice given approximately one year prior to cancellation in the event of early termination at year 18 we have the option to cause the sale of the vessel at its fair value and to use the proceeds towards the applicable termination payment 

alternatively we could opt at such time to make a termination payment of approximately £654 million or approximately 1083 million based on the exchange rate at december 31 2013  and relinquish our right to cause the sale of the vessel under current circumstances we do not believe early termination of this lease is probable 

under the brilliance of the seas  operating lease we have agreed to indemnify the lessor to the extent its aftertax return is negatively impacted by unfavorable changes in corporate tax rates capital allowance deductions and certain unfavorable determinations which may be made by united kingdom tax authorities these indemnifications could result in an increase in our lease payments we are unable to estimate the maximum potential increase in our lease payments due to the various circumstances timing or a combination of events that could trigger such indemnifications the united kingdom tax authorities are disputing the lessors accounting treatment of the lease and the lessor and tax authorities are in discussions on the matter if the characterization of the lease is ultimately determined to be incorrect we could be required to indemnify the lessor under certain circumstances the lessor has advised us that they believe their characterization of the lease is correct based on the foregoing and our review of available information we do not believe an indemnification payment is probable however if the lessor loses its dispute and we are required to indemnify the lessor we cannot at this time predict the impact that such an occurrence would have on our financial condition and results of operations 

in connection with the sale of celebrity mercury  in february 2011 we and tui ag each guaranteed repayment of 50 of an €1800 million amortizing bank loan provided to tui cruises which is due 2016 as of december 31 2013  €1350 million or approximately 1860 million based on the exchange rate at december 31 2013  remains outstanding based on current facts and circumstances we do not believe potential obligations under this guarantee are probable 

tui cruises entered into construction agreements with stx finland that includes certain restrictions on each of our and tui ags ability to reduce our current ownership interest in tui cruises below 375 through the construction periods for the first and second tui newbuild vessels in addition the credit agreements for the financing of the ships extends this restriction through 2019 

some of the contracts that we enter into include indemnification provisions that obligate us to make payments to the counterparty if certain events occur these contingencies generally relate to changes in taxes increased lender capital costs and other similar costs the indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms and are entered into in the normal course of business there are no stated or notional amounts included in the indemnification clauses and we are not able to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments if any under these indemnification clauses we have not been required to make any payments under such indemnification clauses in the past and under current circumstances we do not believe an indemnification obligation is probable 

other than the items described above we are not party to any other offbalance sheet arrangements including guarantee contracts retained or contingent interest certain derivative instruments and variable interest entities that either have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial position 

funding needs and sources 

we have significant contractual obligations of which our debt service obligations and the capital expenditures associated with our ship purchases represent our largest funding needs we have approximately 30 billion in contractual obligations due in 2014 of which approximately 16 billion relates to debt maturities and 9345 million relates to the acquisition of quantum of the seas  along with progress payments on our ship purchases in addition we have 112 billion in contractual obligations due beyond 2013 of which debt maturities and ship purchase obligations represent 65 billion and 28 billion respectively we have historically relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations drawdowns under our available credit facilities the incurrence of additional debt andor the refinancing of our existing debt and the issuance of additional shares of equity securities to fund these obligations 

we had a working capital deficit of 33 billion  as of december 31 2013  as compared to a working capital deficit of 32 billion  as of december 31 2012  included within our working capital deficit is 16 billion  and 15 billion  of current portion of longterm debt as of december 31 2013  and december 31 2012  respectively the increase in working capital deficit was primarily due to the increase in current maturities of longterm debt similar to others in our industry we operate with a substantial working capital deficit this deficit is mainly attributable to the fact that 

under our business model a vast majority of our passenger ticket receipts are collected in advance of the applicable sailing date these advance passenger receipts remain a current liability until the sailing date the cash generated from these advance receipts is used interchangeably with cash on hand from other sources such as our revolving credit facilities and other cash from operations the cash received as advanced receipts can be used to fund operating expenses for the applicable future sailing or otherwise pay down our revolving credit facilities invest in long term investments or any other use of cash in addition we have a relatively lowlevel of accounts receivable and rapid turnover results in a limited investment in inventories we generate substantial cash flows from operations and our business model along with our unsecured revolving credit facilities has historically allowed us to maintain this working capital deficit and still meet our operating investing and financing needs we expect that we will continue to have working capital deficits in the future 

as of december 31 2013  we have approximately 81 billion  in longterm debt obligations during 2012 and 2013 we entered into a series of transactions to refinance our 2013 and 2014 bond maturities reduce interest costs improve financing terms and extend maturities during 2013 we entered into a credit agreement which provides an unsecured term loan facility in an amount up to 3800 million due august 2018 we amended and restated our 5250 million unsecured revolving credit facility to 8500 million reduced the pricing and extended the termination date to august 2018 in addition we increased the capacity of our revolving credit facility due july 2016 by 200 million bringing our total capacity under this facility to 11 billion as of december 31 2013  we have an aggregate revolving borrowing capacity of 20 billion refer to note 7 longterm debt to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for further information 

as of december 31 2013  we had liquidity of 19 billion  consisting of approximately 2047 million  in cash and cash equivalents and 17 billion  available under our unsecured credit facilities we anticipate that our cash flows from operations and our current financing arrangements as described above will be adequate to meet our capital expenditures and debt repayments over the next twelvemonth period in january 2014 we repaid our €7450 million 5625 unsecured senior notes with proceeds from our 3800 million  unsecured term loan facility and our revolving credit facilities 

in 2013 we repurchased 210 million of our 11875 unsecured senior notes due 2015 total consideration paid in connection with these repurchases including premium and related fees and expenses was 249 million resulting in a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of approximately 42 million which was immediately recognized in earnings we may from time to time repurchase our debt in the open market through debt tender offers exchanges of debt securities by exercising redemption rights or in privately negotiated transactions we may also refinance existing debt or exchange existing debt for newly issued debt obligations 

as of december 31 2013  we have on order three quantumclass ships and one oasisclass ship each of which has committed unsecured bank financing arrangements which include sovereign financing guarantees refer to note 15 commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further information 

we are in the process of implementing a broad profitability improvement program aimed at increasing revenues and reducing expenses with a goal of further improving our returns on invested capital there are numerous initiatives in connection with this program that are at different stages of implementation one of those initiatives relates to realizing economies of scale and improving service delivery to our travel partners and guests by restructuring and consolidating our global sales marketing and general and administrative structure during the third quarter of 2013 we moved forward with activities related to this initiative a second initiative relates to pullmantur’s focus on the cruise business and expansion in latin america during the fourth quarter of 2013 we moved forward with activities related to this initiative we expect to incur an estimated remaining amount of 32 million of cash outlays mostly through the end of 2014 to complete these initiatives we believe the cash outlays will be offset by increased cash inflows from the expected cost savings 

we also continue to implement a number of initiatives to reduce energy consumption and by extension fuel costs these include the design of more fuel efficient ships and the implementation of other hardware and energy efficiencies 

if i any person other than a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates and their respective affiliates the “applicable group” acquires ownership of more than 33 of our common stock and the applicable group owns less of our common stock than such person or ii subject to certain exceptions during any 24month period a majority of the board is no longer comprised of individuals who were members of the board on the first day of such period we may be obligated to prepay indebtedness outstanding under the majority of our credit facilities which we may be unable to replace on similar terms certain of our outstanding debt securities also contain change of control provisions that would be triggered by the acquisition of greater than 50 of our common stock by a person other than a member of the applicable group coupled with a ratings downgrade if this were to occur it would have an adverse impact on our liquidity and operations 

debt covenants 

certain of our financing agreements contain financial covenants that require us among other things to maintain minimum net worth of at least 59 billion a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 125x and limit our net debttocapital ratio to no more than 625 the fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated by dividing net cash from operations for the past four quarters by the sum of dividend payments plus scheduled principal debt payments in excess of any new financings for the past four quarters our minimum net worth and maximum net debttocapital calculations exclude the impact of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  on total shareholders equity  we are well in excess of all financial covenant requirements as of december 31 2013  the specific covenants and related definitions can be found in the applicable debt agreements the majority of which have been previously filed with the securities and exchange commission 

dividends 

in december 2013  we declared a cash dividend on our common stock of 025  per share which was paid in the first quarter of 2014  we declared a cash dividend on our common stock of 025  per share during the third quarter of 2013  which was paid in the fourth quarter of 2013  we declared and paid a cash dividend on our common stock of 012  per share during the first and second quarters of 2013  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial instruments and other 

general 

we are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices we manage these risks through a combination of our normal operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments pursuant to our hedging practices and policies the financial impact of these hedging instruments is primarily offset by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures being hedged we achieve this by closely matching the amount term and conditions of the derivative instrument with the underlying risk being hedged although certain of our derivative financial instruments do not qualify or are not accounted for under hedge accounting we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes we monitor our derivative positions using techniques including market valuations and sensitivity analyses see note 14 fair value measurements   and derivative instruments to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our longterm debt obligations including future interest payments and our operating lease for brilliance of the seas  at december 31 2013 approximately 346  of our longterm debt was effectively fixed as compared to 458  as of december 31 2012 we use interest rate swap agreements to modify our exposure to interest rate movements and to manage our interest expense and rent expense 

market risk associated with our longterm fixedrate debt is the potential increase in fair value resulting from a decrease in interest rates we use interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a portion of our fixedrate debt to a floatingrate basis to manage this risk at december 31 2013  and december 31 2012  we maintained interest rate swap agreements on the 4200 million fixedrate portion of our oasis of the seas  unsecured amortizing term loan the interest rate swap agreements effectively changed the interest rate on the balance of the unsecured term loan which was 2800 million as of december 31 2013 from a fixed rate of 541 to a liborbased floating rate equal to libor plus 387 currently approximately 423 in addition during 2013 we entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively changed the interest rate on the 6500 million unsecured senior notes due 2022 from a fixed rate of 525 to a liborbased floating rate equal to libor plus 363 currently approximately 387 these interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as fair value hedges 

the estimated fair value of our longterm fixedrate debt at december 31 2013 was 33 billion using quoted market prices where available or using the present value of expected future cash flows which incorporates risk profile the fair value of our fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements was estimated to be a liability of 696 million as of december 31 2013 based on the present value of expected future cash flows a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates at december 31 2013 would increase the fair value of our hedged and unhedged longterm fixedrate debt by approximately 1099 million and would increase the fair value of our fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements by 608 million 

market risk associated with our longterm floatingrate debt is the potential increase in interest expense from an increase in interest rates we use interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a portion of our floatingrate debt to a fixedrate basis to manage this risk a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase our forecasted 2014 interest expense by approximately 486 million assuming no change in foreign currency exchange rates 

at december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 we maintained interest rate swap agreements on a portion of the celebrity reflection  unsecured amortizing term loan beginning april 2013 the interest rate swap agreements effectively converted the interest rate on the balance of the unsecured term loan which was 6000 million as of december 31 2013 from a floating rate equal to libor plus 040 to a fixed rate including applicable margin of 

285 through the term of the loan these interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges in addition at december 31 2013  and december 31 2012  we maintained forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements that hedge the anticipated unsecured amortizing term loans that will finance our purchase of quantum of the seas  and anthem of the seas  forwardstarting interest rate swaps hedging the quantum of the seas  loan will effectively convert the interest rate for 7350 million of the anticipated loan balance from libor plus 130 to a fixed rate of 374 inclusive of margin beginning in october 2014 forwardstarting interest rate swaps hedging the anthem of the seas  loan will effectively convert the interest rate for 7250 million of the anticipated loan balance from libor plus 130 to a fixed rate of 386 inclusive of margin beginning in april 2015 

 the fair value of our floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements was estimated to be an asset of 566 million as of december 31 2013 based on the present value of expected future cash flows 

market risk associated with our operating lease for brilliance of the seas  is the potential increase in rent expense from an increase in sterling libor rates a hypothetical one percentage point increase in sterling libor rates would increase our forecasted 2014 rent expense by approximately 26 million based on the exchange rate at december 31 2013 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to our ship construction contracts denominated in euros our foreign currency denominated debt and our international business operations we enter into foreign currency forward contracts collar options and crosscurrency swap agreements to manage portions of the exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates the majority of our foreign currency forward contracts collar options and crosscurrency swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow or fair value hedges depending on the designation of the related hedge 

the estimated fair value as of december 31 2013 of our eurodenominated forward contracts associated with our ship construction contracts was an asset of 681 million based on the present value of expected future cash flows as of december 31 2013 the aggregate cost of our ships on order was approximately 47 billion of which we had disbursed 5188 million as of such date approximately 363 and 497 of the aggregate cost of the ships under construction was exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate at december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 respectively a hypothetical 10 strengthening of the euro as of december 31 2013 assuming no changes in comparative interest rates would result in a 1677 million increase in the united states dollar cost of the foreign currency denominated ship construction contracts exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate 

  

our international business operations subject us to foreign currency exchange risk we transact business in many different foreign currencies and maintain investments in foreign operations which may expose us to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates movements in foreign currency exchange rates may affect the translated value of our earnings and cash flows we manage most of this exposure on a consolidated basis which allows us to take advantage of any natural offsets therefore weakness in one particular currency might be offset by strengths in other currencies over time our earnings are also subject to volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the united states dollar to mitigate our foreign currency exchange rate exposure resulting from our net foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities we denominate a portion of our debt in our subsidiaries’ and investments’ functional currencies enter into foreign currency forward contracts and we have historically utilized crosscurrency swap agreements 

during 2012 we entered into foreign currency collar options to hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposure on the construction contract price for anthem of the seas  these options mature in april 2015 and have an estimated fair value of 222 million at december 31 2013 in addition during 2013 we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge €3650 million of our €7450 million 5625 unsecured senior notes due january 2014 these foreign currency forward contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges and mature january 2014 

we consider our investments in our foreign operations to be denominated in relatively stable currencies and of a longterm nature we partially mitigate the exposure of our investments in foreign operations by denominating a portion of our debt in our subsidiaries’ and investments’ functional currencies and designating it as a hedge of these subsidiaries and investments we had designated debt as a hedge of our net investments in pullmantur and tui cruises of approximately €5449 million and €4817 million or approximately 7508 million and 6351 million through december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively accordingly we have included approximately 444 million and 101 million of foreigncurrency transaction losses in the foreign currency translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  at december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 respectively a hypothetical 10 increase or decrease in the december 31 2013 euro exchange rate would increase or decrease the fair value of our assigned debt by 1678 million which would be offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the united states dollar value of our net investment 

lastly on a regular basis we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than our functional currency or the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries during 2013 we maintained an average of approximately 4067 million of these foreign currency forward contracts these instruments are not designated as hedging instruments changes in the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts were losses of approximately 193 million which offset gains arising from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies of 134 million for the year ended december 31 2013 changes in the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts were gains of approximately 77 million which offset losses arising from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies of 118 million for the year ended december 31 2012 changes in the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts were losses of approximately 11 million and losses arising from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies of 16 million which resulted in a total loss of 27 million for the year ended december 31 2011 these changes were recognized in earnings within other expense income in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss 

fuel price risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates primarily to the consumption of fuel on our ships fuel cost net of the financial impact of fuel swap agreements as a percentage of our total revenues was approximately 116  in 2013  118  in 2012  and 101  in 2011  we use a range of instruments including fuel swap agreements and fuel call options to mitigate the financial impact of fluctuations in fuel prices 

as of december 31 2013  we had fuel swap agreements to pay fixed prices for fuel with an aggregate notional amount of approximately 12 billion maturing through 2017 the fuel swap agreements represent 57  of our projected 2014  fuel requirements 45  of our projected 2015  fuel requirements 25  of our projected 2016  fuel requirements and 5  of our projected 2017  fuel requirements these fuel swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges the estimated fair value of these contracts at december 31 2013 was estimated to be an asset of 85 million we estimate that a hypothetical 10 increase in our weightedaverage fuel price from that experienced during the year ended december 31 2013 would increase our forecasted 2014 fuel cost by approximately 409 million net of the impact of fuel swap agreements

industry 

cruising is considered a well established vacation sector in the north american market a growing sector over the longterm in the european market and a developing but promising sector in several other emerging markets industry data indicates that a significant portion of cruise guests carried are firsttime cruisers we believe this presents an opportunity for longterm growth and a potential for increased profitability 

we estimate that the global cruise industry carried 208 million cruise guests in 2012 compared to 202 million cruise guests carried in 2011 and 188 million cruise guests carried in 2010 we estimate that the global cruise fleet was served by approximately 432000 berths on approximately 282 ships at the end of 2012 there are approximately 19 ships with an estimated 65000 berths that are expected to be placed in service in the global cruise market between 2013 and 2017 although it is also possible that ships could be taken out of service during these periods the majority of cruise guests have historically been sourced from north america and europe 

north america 

the north american cruise market has historically experienced significant growth the compound annual growth rate in cruise guests for this market was approximately 45 from 2008 to 2012 we estimate that north america was served by 144 ships with approximately 212000 berths at the beginning of 2008 and by 146 ships with approximately 258000 berths at the end of 2012 there are approximately 10 ships with an estimated 40000 berths that are expected to be placed in service in the north american cruise market between 2013 and 2017 

europe 

as compared to north america the european cruise market represents a smaller but even faster growing sector of the vacation industry it has experienced a compound annual growth rate in cruise guests of approximately 76 from 2008 to 2012 this market has recently experienced a number of challenges as a result of the effects of the costa concordia incident and the continued instability in the european economic landscape however we continue to believe in the long term growth potential of this market we estimate that europe was served by 102 ships with approximately 108000 berths at the beginning of 2008 and by 117 ships with approximately 156000 berths at the end of 2012 there are approximately 9 ships with an estimated 25000 berths that are expected to be placed in service in the european cruise market between 2013 and 2017 

the following table details the growth in the global north american and european cruise markets in terms of cruise guests and estimated weightedaverage berths over the past five years 



1 source our estimates of the number of global cruise guests and the weightedaverage supply of berths marketed globally in north america and europe are based on a combination of data that we obtain from various publicly available cruise industry trade information sources including seatrade insider and cruise line international association clia in addition our estimates incorporate our own statistical analysis utilizing the same publicly available cruise industry data as a base 2 source cruise line international association based on cruise guests carried for at least two consecutive nights for years 2008 through 2011 year 2012 amounts represent our estimates see number 1 above 3 source clia europe formerly european cruise council for years 2008 through 2011 year 2012 amounts represent our estimates see number 1 above other markets 

in addition to expected industry growth in north america and europe as discussed above we expect the asiapacific region to demonstrate an even higher growth rate in the near term although it will continue to represent a relatively small sector compared to north america and europe 

competition 

we compete with a number of cruise lines our principal competitors are carnival corporation  plc which owns among others aida cruises carnival cruise lines costa cruises cunard line holland america line iberocruceros po cruises and princess cruises disney cruise line msc cruises norwegian cruise line and oceania cruises cruise lines compete with other vacation alternatives such as landbased resort hotels and sightseeing destinations for consumers leisure time demand for such activities is influenced by political and general economic conditions companies within the vacation market are dependent on consumer discretionary spending

cruise pricing 

our cruise ticket prices include accommodations and a wide variety of activities and amenities including meals and entertainment prices vary depending on the destination cruise length stateroom category selected and the time of year the cruise takes place although we grant credit terms to certain travel agencies and tour operators in select markets outside of the united states our payment terms generally require an upfront deposit to confirm a reservation with the balance due prior to the sailing during the selling period of a cruise we continually monitor and adjust our cruise ticket prices for available guest staterooms based on demand with the objective of maximizing net yields in 2013 we plan to use new optimization tools to set pricing and leverage enhancements for the web and our reservation systems historically we have opened cruises for sale at least one year in advance and often as much as two years in advance additionally we offer air transportation as a service for guests that elect to utilize our transportation program our air transportation program is available in major cities around the world and prices vary by gateway and destination generally air tickets are sold to guests at prices close to cost passenger ticket revenues accounted for approximately 73 of total revenues in 2012 2011 and 2010 

from time to time we have introduced temporary fuel supplements to partially offset a portion of fuel costs which result in an additional fee being charged to the guests while none of our brands are currently charging fuel supplements we reserve the right to reinstate our fuel supplements for one or more of our brands and will continue to monitor our markets and review our position based upon the appropriate facts and circumstances 

onboard activities and other revenues 

our cruise brands offer modern fleets with a wide array of onboard services amenities and activities which vary by brand and ship while many onboard activities are included in the base price of a cruise we realize additional revenues from among other things gaming the sale of alcoholic and other beverages gift shop items shore excursions photography spasalon and fitness services art auctions catalogue gifts for guests and a wide variety of specialty restaurants and dining options royal caribbean international celebrity cruises and azamara club cruises offer functionality on their respective internet sites for selecting shore excursions specialty dining and amenities prior to embarkation

segment reporting 

we operate five whollyowned cruise brands royal caribbean international celebrity cruises azamara club cruises pullmantur and cdf croisières de france in addition we have a 50 investment in a joint venture with tui ag which operates the brand tui cruises we believe our global brands possess the versatility to enter multiple cruise market segments within the cruise vacation industry although each of our brands has its own marketing style as well as ships and crews of various sizes the nature of the products sold and services delivered by our brands share a common base ie the sale and provision of cruise vacations our brands also have similar itineraries as well as 

similar cost and revenue components in addition our brands source passengers from similar markets around the world and operate in similar economic environments with a significant degree of commercial overlap as a result our brands including tui cruises have been aggregated as a single reportable segment based on the similarity of their economic characteristics types of consumers regulatory environment maintenance requirements supporting systems and processes as well as products and services provided our chairman and chief executive officer has been identified as the chief operating decisionmaker and all significant operating decisions including the allocation of resources are based upon the analyses of the company as one segment  for financial information see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

employees 

as of december 31 2012 we employed approximately 62000 employees including 55000 shipboard employees as well as 6200 fulltime and 750 parttime employees in our shoreside operations as of december 31 2012 approximately 80 of our shipboard employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements based on employee survey results we believe our employees satisfaction level with our organization is strong 

insurance 

we maintain insurance on the hull and machinery of our ships which includes additional coverage for disbursements earnings and increased value which are maintained in amounts related to the value of each ship the coverage for each of the hull policies is maintained with syndicates of insurance underwriters from the british scandinavian french united states and other international insurance markets 

we maintain liability protection and indemnity insurance for each of our ships through either the united kingdom mutual steam ship assurance association bermuda limited the steamship mutual underwriting association bermuda limited or the assuranceforeningen skuld gjensidig our protection and indemnity liability insurance is done on a mutual basis and we are subject to additional premium calls in amounts based on claim records of all members of the mutual protection and indemnity association we are also subject to additional premium calls based on investment shortfalls experienced by the insurer 

we maintain war risk insurance which covers damage due to acts of war including invasion insurrection terrorism rebellion piracy and hijacking on each ship through a norwegian war risk insurance organization this coverage includes coverage for physical damage to the ship which is not covered under the hull policies as a result of war exclusion clauses in such hull policies we also maintain protection and indemnity war risk coverage for risks that would be excluded by the rules of the indemnity insurance organizations subject to certain limitations consistent with most marine war risk policies under the terms of our war risk insurance coverage underwriters can give seven days notice to us that the policy will be canceled and reinstated at higher premium rates 

insurance coverage for shoreside property shipboard inventory and general liability risks are maintained with insurance underwriters in the united states and the united kingdom 

we do not carry business interruption insurance for our ships based on our evaluation of the risks involved and protective measures already in place as compared to the cost of insurance we carry business interruption insurance for certain of our shoreside operations 

all insurance coverage is subject to certain limitations exclusions and deductible levels in addition in certain circumstances we either selfinsure or coinsure a portion of these risks premiums charged by insurance carriers including carriers in the maritime insurance industry increase or decrease from time to time and tend to be cyclical in nature these cycles are impacted both by our 

own loss experience and by losses incurred in direct and reinsurance markets we historically have been able to obtain insurance coverage in amounts and at premiums we have deemed to be commercially acceptable no assurance can be given that affordable and secure insurance markets will be available to us in the future particularly for war risk insurance 

the athens convention relating to the carriage of passengers and their luggage by sea 1974 and the 1976 protocol to the athens convention are generally applicable to passenger ships the united states has not ratified the athens convention however with limited exceptions the 1976 athens convention protocol may be contractually enforced with respect to those of our cruises that do not call at a united states port the international maritime organization diplomatic conference agreed upon a new protocol to the athens convention on november 1 2002 the 2002 protocol which is not yet in force pending ratification by the requisite number of countries substantially increases the level of compulsory insurance which must be maintained by passenger ship operators in an attempt to expedite implementation the european union adopted the european union regulation 3922009 eu passenger liability regulation on the liability of carriers of passengers by sea which became effective on december 31 2012 this regulation incorporates the 2002 protocol in many ways compliance with the eu passenger liability regulation does not have a material impact on operating costs 

trademarks 

we own a number of registered trademarks related to the royal caribbean international celebrity cruises azamara club cruises pullmantur and cdf croisières de france cruise brands the registered trademarks include the name royal caribbean international and its crown and anchor logo the name celebrity cruises and its x logo the name azamara club cruises and its logo the names pullmantur cruises and pullmantur and their logos the name cdf croisières de france and its logo and the names of various cruise ships we believe our trademarks are widely recognized throughout the world and have considerable value 

regulation 

our ships are regulated by various international national state and local laws regulations and treaties in force in the jurisdictions in which they operate in addition our ships are registered in the bahamas malta or in the case of celebrity xpedition  ecuador collectively the flag states each ship is subject to regulations issued by its country of registry including regulations issued pursuant to international treaties governing the safety of our ships guests and crew as well as environmental protection each country of registry conducts periodic inspections to verify compliance with these regulations as discussed more fully below ships operating out of united states ports are subject to inspection by the united states coast guard for compliance with international treaties and by the united states public health service for sanitary and health conditions our ships are also subject to similar inspections pursuant to the laws and regulations of various other countries our ships visit 

we believe that we are in material compliance with all the regulations applicable to our ships and that we have all licenses necessary to conduct our business health safety security environmental and financial responsibility issues are and we believe will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant government authorities in the united states and internationally from time to time various regulatory and legislative changes may be proposed that could impact our operations and subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 

safety and security regulations 

our ships are required to comply with international safety standards defined in the international convention for safety of life at sea solas which among other things establishes requirements 

for ship design structural features materials construction life saving equipment and safe management and operation of ships to ensure guest and crew safety the solas standards are revised from time to time and the most recent modifications were phased in through 2010 compliance with these modified standards did not have a material effect on our operating costs solas incorporates the international safety management code ism code which provides an international standard for the safe management and operation of ships and for pollution prevention the ism code is mandatory for all vessels including passenger vessel operators all of our operations and ships are regularly audited by national authorities and maintain the required certificates of compliance with the ism code it is possible that the costa concordia incident could lead to new safety legislation andor regulations although it is too early to assess the impact of any such legislation or regulation we already equal or exceed most of the new safety measures under discussion and accordingly do not expect that we would be required to incur additional material compliance costs 

our ships are subject to various security requirements including the international ship and port facility security code isps code which is part of solas and the us maritime transportation security act of 2002 mtsa which applies to ships that operate in us ports in order to satisfy these security requirements we implement security measures conduct vessel security assessments and develop security plans the security plans for all of our ships have been submitted to and approved by the respective countries of registry for our ships in compliance with the isps code and the mtsa 

in july 2010 the us adopted the cruise vessel security and safety act of 2010 which applies to passenger vessels which embark or include port stops within the united states this act requires the implementation of certain safety design features as well the establishment of practices for the reporting of and dealing with allegations of crime in 2013 the us coast guard is expected to issue regulations governing implementation of certain provisions of the act we already exceed most of the requirements of the act and do not expect any costs that would be material to us to be required due to these likely regulations 

environmental regulations 

we are subject to various united states and international laws and regulations relating to environmental protection under such laws and regulations we are prohibited from among other things discharging certain materials such as petrochemicals and plastics into the waterways we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations from time to time environmental and other regulators consider more stringent regulations which may affect our operations and increase our compliance costs we believe that the impact of ships on the global environment will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world and accordingly may subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future including the items described below 

our ships are subject to the international maritime organizations imo regulations under the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships the marpol regulations which includes requirements designed to prevent and minimize pollution by oil sewage garbage and air emissions we have obtained the relevant international compliance certificates relating to oil sewage and air pollution prevention for all of our ships 

the marpol regulations impose global limitations on the sulfur content of fuel used by ships operating worldwide permitted sulfur content was reduced from 45 to 35 on january 1 2012 this reduction has not had a material effect on our fuel and operating costs these regulations will also require the worldwide limitations on sulfur content of fuel to be reduced to 05 by january 1 2020 subject to a feasibility review to be completed by imo no later than 2018 if such a reduced limitation is implemented worldwide in 2020 our fuel costs could increase significantly 

in addition to the global limitations the marpol regulations establish special emission control areas ecas with stringent limitations on sulfur and nitrogen oxide emissions in these areas as of july 1 2010 ships operating in designated ecas are required to operate on fuel with a sulfur content of 10 under these regulations ships operating in ecas will be required to further reduce their fuel sulfur content to 01 beginning on january 1 2015 

as of february 2013 there are three established ecas the baltic sea the north seaenglish channel and certain of the waters surrounding the north american coast in addition in july 2011 the imo accepted and adopted the application by the united states to designate the waters surrounding puerto rico and the us virgin islands as an eca this designation will be effective as of january 2014 

as of the date hereof the sulfur content reductions in the existing ecas has not had a material impact on our operations and we do not expect the initial sulfur content reductions in the puerto ricous virgin islands eca will have a material effect on our fuel and operating costs however the additional reduction to 01 as of january 1 2015 will increase our fuel costs after this date based on 2013 itineraries and projected fuel consumption inside these ecas as well as current fuel prices and technologies we estimate that implementation of the 01 low sulfur content requirement in all four currently designated ecas would increase our 2013 fuel costs by approximately 650 million to 700 million these costs may be reduced by possible mitigating factors such as decreases in fuel prices changes in the future supply and demand for fuel the development of emissions abatement technologies including new engine designs or exhaust gas treatment systems the acceptance of alternative compliance methods the cost migration effects of equivalent compliance initiatives and new fuel conservation initiatives 

in july 2011 new marpol regulations introduced mandatory measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions these include the utilization of an energy efficiency design index eedi for new ships as well as the establishment of an energy efficient management plan for all ships the eedi is a performancebased mechanism that requires a certain minimum energy efficiency in new ships these regulations became effective on january 1 2013 we do not anticipate that compliance with these regulations will have a material effect on our operating costs 

we are required to obtain certificates from the united states coast guard relating to our ability to satisfy liability in cases of water pollution pursuant to united states coast guard regulations we arrange through our insurers for the provision of guarantees aggregating 3494 million as a condition to obtaining the required certificates the cost of obtaining these guarantees does not have a material effect on our operating costs 

labor regulations 

the international labour organization an agency of the united nations that develops worldwide employment standards has adopted a new consolidated maritime labour convention the convention the convention which will be effective starting in august 2013 reflects a broad range of standards and conditions to govern all aspects of crew management for ships in international commerce including additional requirements not previously in effect relating to the health safety repatriation entitlements and status of crewmembers and crew recruitment practices each of our flag states will be required to enact legislation prior to august 2013 that includes standards at least as stringent as those set forth in the convention as of the date of this report this legislation has not been finalized assuming that the flag states do not impose regulations that materially differ from the convention requirements we do no anticipate that our compliance costs will be material there can be no assurances however that the flag states will not seek to adopt additional requirements that could require us to incur unanticipated material expenses 

consumer financial responsibility regulations 

we are required to obtain certificates from the united states federal maritime commission relating to our ability to satisfy liability in cases of nonperformance of obligations to guests as well as casualty and personal injury pursuant to the united states federal maritime commission regulations we arrange through our insurers for the provision of guarantees in the amount of 150 million for each of our two us shipoperating companies royal caribbean cruises ltd and celebrity cruises inc and a bond in the amount of 150 million for one of our uk ship operating companies as a condition to obtaining the required certificates in february 2013 the united states federal maritime commission approved amendments to the performance bond requirements that will increase the required guarantees to 300 million per operator 900 million in the aggregate over a twoyear phasein period once phasedin the guarantee requirements will be subject to additional consumer price index based adjustments the new rules will become effective in the first quarter of 2014 we do not anticipate that compliance with the new rules will have a material effect on our costs 

we are also required by the united kingdom norway finland and the baltics to establish our financial responsibility for any liability resulting from the nonperformance of our obligations to guests from these jurisdictions in the united kingdom we are currently required by the association of british travel agents to provide performance bonds totaling approximately £321 million the norwegian travel guarantee fund requires us to maintain performance bonds in varying amounts during the course of the year to cover our financial responsibility in norway finland and the baltics these amounts ranged from 49 million to 188 million during 2012 we are also required to pay to the united kingdom civil aviation authority a nonrefundable levy of £250 per guest where we arrange a flight as part of the cruise vacation 

certain other jurisdictions also require that we establish financial responsibility to our guests resulting from the nonperformance of our obligations however the related amounts do not have a material effect on our costs 

regulations regarding protection of disabled persons 

in 2010 the united states department of transportation issued regulations the new ada regulations addressing various issues applicable to passenger vessels under the american with disabilities act the ada part i of the new ada regulations which include required reservation policies for disabled guests and requirements for aids and services to disabled passengers became effective in january 2011 we believe we are in compliance with part i of the new ada regulations and did not need to make any material expenditures to comply part ii when issued is expected to address physical accessibility standards while we believe our vessels have been designed and outfitted to meet the needs of our disabled guests we cannot at this time accurately predict whether we will be required to make material modifications or incur significant additional expenses in response to part ii of the new ada regulations 

taxation of the company 

the following is a summary of our principal taxes exemptions and special regimes in addition to or instead of income taxation virtually all jurisdictions where our ships call impose some tax or fee or both based on guest headcount tonnage or some other measure 

we are primarily foreign corporations engaged in the owning and operating of passenger cruise ships in international transportation during 2012 we also operated other businesses primarily consisting of the landtour operation in alaska and the pullmantur landtour and air business 

united states income taxation 

the following is a discussion of the application of the united states federal and state income tax laws to us and is based on the current provisions of the united states internal revenue code treasury department regulations administrative rulings court decisions and the relevant state tax laws regulations rulings and court decisions of the states where we have business operations all of the foregoing is subject to change and any such change could affect the accuracy of this discussion 

application of section 883 of the internal revenue code 

we and celebrity cruises inc are engaged in a trade or business in the united states and many of our shipowning subsidiaries depending upon the itineraries of their ships receive income from sources within the united states additionally our united kingdom tonnage tax company owned by us and celebrity cruises inc is a shipoperating company classified as a partnership for united states federal income tax purposes that may earn united states source income under section 883 of the internal revenue code certain foreign corporations are not subject to united states federal income or branch profits tax on united states source income derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships including income from the leasing of such ships 

a foreign corporation will qualify for the benefits of section 883 if in relevant part 1 the foreign country in which the foreign corporation is organized grants an equivalent exemption to corporations organized in the united states and 2 the stock of the corporation or the direct or indirect corporate parent thereof is primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market in the united states or another qualifying country such as norway in the opinion of our united states tax counsel drinker biddle  reath llp based on the representations and assumptions set forth in that opinion we celebrity cruises inc and our shipowning subsidiaries qualify for the benefits of section 883 because we and each of those subsidiaries are incorporated in liberia or malta which are qualifying countries and our common stock is primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market in the united states or norway if in the future 1 liberia or malta no longer qualifies as an equivalent exemption jurisdiction and we do not reincorporate in a jurisdiction that does qualify for the exemption or 2 we fail to qualify as a publicly traded corporation we and all of our shipowning or operating subsidiaries that rely on section 883 for tax exemption on qualifying income would be subject to united states federal income tax on their united states source shipping income and income from activities incidental thereto 

we believe that most of our income and the income of our shipowning subsidiaries is derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships and therefore is exempt from taxation under section 883 additionally income earned through a partnership will qualify as income derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships to the same extent as the income would so qualify if earned directly by the partners thus we believe that united states source income derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships earned by the united kingdom tonnage tax company will qualify for exemption under section 883 to the same extent as if it were earned directly by the owners of the united kingdom tonnage tax company 

regulations under section 883 list activities that are not considered by the internal revenue service to be incidental to the international operation of ships including the sale of air and land transportation shore excursions and pre and postcruise tours our income from these activities that is earned from sources within the united states will be subject to united states taxation 

taxation in the absence of an exemption under section 883 

if we the operator of our vessels celebrity cruises inc or our shipowning subsidiaries were to fail to meet the requirements of section 883 of the internal revenue code or if the provision was 

repealed then as explained below such companies would be subject to united states income taxation on a portion of their income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships 

because we and celebrity cruises inc conduct a trade or business in the united states we and celebrity cruises inc would be taxable at regular corporate rates on our separate company taxable income ie without regard to the income of our shipowning subsidiaries from united states sources in addition if any of our earnings and profits effectively connected with our united states trade or business were withdrawn or were deemed to have been withdrawn from our united states trade or business those withdrawn amounts would be subject to a branch profits tax at the rate of 30 we and celebrity cruises inc would also be potentially subject to tax on portions of certain interest paid by us at rates of up to 30 

if section 883 were not available to our shipowning subsidiaries each such subsidiary would be subject to a special 4 tax on its united states source gross transportation income if any each year because it does not have a fixed place of business in the united states and its income is derived from the leasing of a ship 

other united states taxation 

we and celebrity cruises inc earn united states source income from activities not considered incidental to international shipping the tax on such income is not material to our results of operation for all years presented 

state taxation 

we celebrity cruises inc and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various united states state income taxes which are generally imposed on each states portion of the united states source income subject to federal income taxes additionally the state of alaska subjects an allocated portion of the total income of companies doing business in alaska and certain other affiliated companies to alaska corporate state income taxes and also imposes a 33 tax on adjusted gross income from onboard gambling activities conducted in alaska waters this did not have a material impact to our results of operations for all years presented 

maltese and spanish income tax 

our pullmantur ship owneroperator subsidiaries which include the owneroperator of cdf croisières de frances ship qualify as licensed shipping organizations in malta no maltese income tax is charged on the income derived from shipping activities of a licensed shipping organization instead a licensed shipping organization is liable to pay a tonnage tax based on the net tonnage of the ship or ships registered under the relevant provisions of the merchant shipping act a company qualifies as a shipping organization if it engages in qualifying activities and it obtains a license from the registrargeneral to enable it to carry on such activities qualifying activities include but are not limited to the ownership operation under charter or otherwise administration and management of a ship or ships registered as a maltese ship in terms of the merchant shipping act and the carrying on of all ancillary financial security and commercial activities in connection therewith 

our maltese operations that do not qualify as licensed shipping organizations which are not considered significant remain subject to normal maltese corporate income tax 

pullmantur has sales and marketing functions landbased tour operations and air business in spain these activities are subject to spanish taxation the tax from these operations is not considered significant to our operations 

united kingdom income tax 

we operate thirteen ships under companies which have elected to be subject to the united kingdom tonnage tax regime uk tonnage tax 

companies subject to uk tonnage tax pay a corporate tax on a notional profit determined with reference to the net tonnage of qualifying vessels normal united kingdom corporate income tax is not chargeable on the relevant shipping profits of a qualifying uk tonnage tax company the requirements for a company to qualify for the uk tonnage tax regime include being subject to united kingdom corporate income tax operating qualifying ships which are strategically and commercially managed in the united kingdom and fulfilling a seafarer training requirement failure to meet any of these requirements could cause us to lose the benefit of the tonnage tax regime which will have a material effect on our results of operations 

relevant shipping profits include income from the operation of qualifying ships and from shipping related activities our united kingdom income from nonshipping activities which do not qualify under the uk tonnage tax regime and which are not considered significant remain subject to united kingdom corporate income tax 

brazilian income tax 

pullmantur and our uk tonnage tax company charters certain ships to brazilian companies for operations in brazil from november to may some of these charters are with unrelated third parties and others are with a brazilian affiliate the brazilian affiliates earnings are subject to brazilian taxation which is not considered significant the charter payments made to the uk tonnage tax company and to pullmantur are exempt from brazilian income tax under current brazilian domestic law 

other taxation 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to income tax in other jurisdictions on income that does not qualify for exemption or tonnage tax regimes the tax on such income was not material to our results of operations for all years presented our uk tonnage tax company is exempt from some taxation in certain jurisdictions where those companies have business operations under relevant united kingdom tax treaties cdf croisières de frances operations within france are minimal and therefore its french income taxes are minimal

 item 1a risk factors 

  the risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k are important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historical results it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks the risks described below are only those known risks relating to our operations and financial condition that we consider material there may be additional risks that we consider not to be material or which are not known and any of these risks could have the effects set forth below see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a cautionary note regarding forwardlooking statements 

adverse worldwide economic geopolitical or other conditions could reduce the demand for cruises and adversely impact our operating results cash flows and financial condition including potentially impairing the value of our ships goodwill and other assets 

the demand for cruises is affected by international national and local economic and geopolitical conditions the slow pace of the economic recovery coupled with continued instability in the global economic landscape has had and continues to have an adverse effect on vacationers discretionary income and consumer confidence this in turn has resulted in cruise booking slowdowns decreased cruise prices and lower onboard revenues for us and for others in the cruise industry as compared to more robust economic times although the cruise industry continued to recover in 2012 recovery has been slow and has been hindered by ongoing economic instability including the continuing european sovereign debt crisis and financial market volatility in addition certain countries have been more severely impacted by recent economic conditions than other economies including for example spain where we operate our pullmantur brand we cannot predict with any certainty whether demand for cruises will continue to improve or the rate of such improvement stagnant or worsening global economic conditions could result in a prolonged period of booking slowdowns depressed cruise prices and reduced onboard revenues 

demand for our cruises is also influenced by geopolitical events unfavorable conditions such as crossborder conflicts civil unrest and governmental changes especially in regions with popular ports of call can undermine consumer demand andor pricing for itineraries featuring these ports 

continued unrest and economic instability could materially adversely impact our operating results cash flows and financial condition including potentially impairing the value of our ships goodwill and other assets during 2012 we recognized total impairment related charges of 4139 million associated with our pullmantur brand see  item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  despite the pullmantur related impairment charges if the spanish economy weakens further or recovers more slowly than contemplated or if the economies of other markets eg france brazil latin america perform worse than contemplated in our discounted cash flow model or if there are material changes to the projected future cash flows used in the impairment analyses especially in net yields an additional impairment charge of the pullmantur reporting units goodwill and trademarks and trade names may be required 

we may not be able to obtain sufficient financing or capital for our needs or may not be able to do so on terms that are acceptable or consistent with our expectations 

to fund our capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments we have historically relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations drawdowns under available credit facilities the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the sale of equity or debt securities in private or public securities markets the decrease in consumer cruise spending as a result of the costa concordia incident and the economic uncertainty in europe had an adverse impact on our cash flows from operations in 2012 see — adverse worldwide economic geopolitical or other conditions  and — incidents or adverse publicity concerning the cruise vacation industry for more information if 

worldwide economic conditions worsen or there is another significant incident impacting the cruise industry our operational cash flows could be negatively affected 

although we believe we can access sufficient liquidity to fund our operations and obligations as expected there can be no assurances to that effect during 2013 we anticipate raising additional funds in the capital or credit markets as part of our refinancing strategy for our upcoming 2013 and 2014 maturities our ability to access additional funding as and when needed our ability to timely refinance andor replace our outstanding debt securities and credit facilities on acceptable terms and our cost of funding will depend upon numerous factors including but not limited to the vibrancy of the financial markets our financial performance and credit ratings and the performance of our industry in general see item 7 managements discussion  analysis of financial condition and results of operations—funding needs and sources for more information 

our inability to satisfy the covenants required by our credit facilities could adversely impact our liquidity 

our debt agreements contain covenants including covenants restricting our ability to take certain actions and financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum net worth and fixed charge coverage ratios and limit our net debttocapital ratio our ability to comply with the terms of our outstanding facilities may be affected by general economic conditions industry conditions and other events some of which may be beyond our control in addition our ability to make borrowings under our available credit facilities is subject to the absence of material adverse changes in our business our ability to maintain our credit facilities may also be impacted by changes in our ownership base more specifically we may be required to prepay a majority of our debt facilities if i any person other than a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates and their respective affiliates the applicable group acquires ownership of more than 33 of our common stock and the applicable group owns less of our common stock than such person or ii subject to certain exceptions during any 24month period a majority of the board is no longer comprised of individuals who were members of the board on the first day of such period certain of our outstanding debt securities also contain change of control provisions that would be triggered by the acquisition of greater than 50 of our common stock by a person other than a member of the applicable group coupled with a ratings downgrade 

our failure to comply with the terms of our debt facilities could result in an event of default generally if an event of default under any debt agreement occurs then pursuant to cross default acceleration clauses our outstanding debt and derivative contract payables could become due andor terminated we cannot provide assurances that we would have sufficient liquidity to repay or refinance the borrowings under any of the credit facilities or settle other outstanding contracts if such amounts were accelerated upon an event of default 

in addition under several of our agreements with credit card processors that accept credit cards for the sale of cruises and other services the credit card processor may hold back a reserve from our credit card receivables following the occurrence of certain events including a default under our major credit facilities as of december 31 2012 we were not required to maintain any reserve under such agreements 

incidents or adverse publicity concerning the cruise vacation industry unusual weather conditions and other natural disasters or disruptions could affect our reputation as well as impact our sales and results of operations 

the operation of cruise ships airplanes land tours port facilities and shore excursions involves the risk of accidents illnesses environmental incidents and other incidents which may bring into question guest safety health security and vacation satisfaction which could negatively impact our reputation incidents involving cruise ships and in particular the safety and security of guests and crew such as the costa concordia incident media coverage thereof as well as adverse media publicity concerning 

the cruise vacation industry or unusual weather patterns or natural disasters or disruptions such as hurricanes and earthquakes and the collateral impact thereof could impact demand for our cruises the considerable expansion in the use of social media over recent years has compounded the potential scope of the negative publicity that could be generated by those incidents if any such incident occurs during a time of high seasonal demand the effect could disproportionately impact our results of operations for the year in addition any events which impact the travel industry more generally may negatively impact our ability to deliver guests to our cruises andor interrupt our ability to obtain services and goods from key vendors in our supply chain any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and on industry performance 

the impact of disruptions in the global financial markets may affect the ability of our counterparties and others to perform their obligations to us 

the financial crisis of 2008 including failures of financial service companies and the related liquidity crisis disrupted the capital and credit markets and additional economic concerns from some of the countries in the european union continue to strain the financial markets both in the us and internationally a recurrence of these disruptions could cause our counterparties and others to breach their obligations to us under our contracts with them this could include failures of banks or other financial service companies to fund required borrowings under our loan agreements or to pay us amounts that may become due under our derivative contracts for hedging of fuel prices interest rates and foreign currencies or other agreements if any of the foregoing occurs it may have a negative impact on our cash flows including our ability to meet our obligations our results of operations and our financial condition 

an increase in capacity worldwide or excess capacity in a particular market could adversely impact our cruise sales andor pricing 

although our ships can be redeployed cruise sales andor pricing may be impacted both by the introduction of new ships into the marketplace and by deployment decisions of ourselves and our competitors a total of 19 new ships with approximately 65000 berths are on order for delivery through 2017 in the cruise industry the further growth in capacity from these new ships and future orders without an increase in the cruise industrys share of the vacation market could depress cruise prices and impede our ability to achieve yield improvement in addition to the extent that we or our competitors deploy ships to a particular itinerary and the resulting capacity in that region exceeds the demand we may lower pricing and profitability may be lower than anticipated any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition including potentially impairing the value of our ships goodwill and other assets 

if we are unable to appropriately balance our cost management strategy with our goal of satisfying guest expectations it may adversely impact our business success 

our goals call for us to provide high quality products and deliver high quality services there can be no assurances that we can successfully balance these goals with our cost containment efforts 

we may lose business to competitors throughout the vacation market  

we operate in the vacation market and cruising is one of many alternatives for people choosing a vacation we therefore risk losing business not only to other cruise lines but also to other vacation operators which provide other leisure options including hotels resorts and package holidays and tours 

we face significant competition from other cruise lines on the basis of cruise pricing travel agent preference and also in terms of the nature of ships and services we offer to guests our principal competitors within the cruise vacation industry include carnival corporation  plc which owns among 

others aida cruises carnival cruise lines costa cruises cunard line holland america line iberocruceros po cruises and princess cruises disney cruise line msc cruises norwegian cruise line and oceania cruises 

in the event that we do not compete effectively with other vacation alternatives and cruise companies our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

fears of terrorist and pirate attacks war and other hostilities and the spread of contagious diseases could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

events such as terrorist and pirate attacks war and other hostilities and the resulting political instability travel restrictions the spread of contagious diseases and concerns over safety health and security aspects of traveling or the fear of any of the foregoing have had and could have in the future a significant adverse impact on demand and pricing in the travel and vacation industry as we continue to globalize our operations we become susceptible to a wider range of adverse events 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our financial results 

we earn revenues pay expenses recognize assets and incur liabilities in currencies other than the us dollar including among others the british pound sterling the canadian dollar the euro the australian dollar and the brazilian real in 2012 we derived approximately 49 of revenues from operations outside the united states because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must convert revenues income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore absent offsetting changes in other foreign currencies increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against other major currencies will affect our revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies we use derivative financial instruments to mitigate our net balance sheet exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations however there can be no assurances that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly the strengthening of the us dollar against major currencies would not materially affect our financial results 

in addition we have ship construction contracts which are denominated in euros while we have entered into eurodenominated forward contracts and collar options to manage a portion of the currency risk associated with these ship construction contracts we are exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate for the portion of the ship construction contracts that has not been hedged additionally if the shipyard is unable to perform under the related ship construction contract any foreign currency hedges that were entered into to manage the currency risk would need to be terminated termination of these contracts could result in a significant loss 

environmental labor health and safety financial responsibility and other maritime regulations could affect operations and increase operating costs 

the united states and various state and foreign government or regulatory agencies have enacted or are considering new environmental regulations or policies such as requiring the use of low sulfur fuels increasing fuel efficiency requirements further restricting emissions or other initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions that could increase our cost for fuel cause us to incur significant expenses to purchase andor develop new equipment and adversely impact the cruise vacation industry some environmental groups have also lobbied for more stringent regulation of cruise ships and have generated negative publicity about the cruise vacation industry and its environmental impact see item 1 business—regulation—environmental regulations an increase in fuel prices not only impacts our fuel costs but also some of our other expenses such as crew travel freight and commodity prices 

in addition we are subject to various international national state and local laws regulations and treaties that govern among other things safety standards applicable to our ships treatment of disabled persons health and sanitary standards applicable to our guests security standards on board our ships and at the shipport interface areas and financial responsibilities to our guests these issues are and we believe will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world especially in light of the costa concordia incident this could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise ships that could subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 

conducting business globally may result in increased costs and other risks 

we operate our business globally and plan to continue to develop our international presence operating internationally exposes us to a number of risks including unstable local economic conditions volatile local political conditions potential changes in duties and taxes including changing interpretations of existing tax laws and regulations required compliance with additional laws and policies affecting cruising vacation or maritime businesses or governing the operations of foreignbased companies currency fluctuations interest rate movements difficulties in operating under local business environments us and global antibribery laws or regulations imposition of trade barriers and restrictions on repatriation of earnings in addition if a country where we have significant operations or obligations leaves the euro currency system our financial condition may be adversely impacted if we are unable to address these risks adequately our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected including potentially impairing the value of our ships goodwill and other assets 

operating globally also exposes us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements in many parts of the world including countries in which we operate practices in the local business communities might not conform to international business standards we must adhere to policies designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance as well as applicable laws and regulations however we might not be successful in ensuring that our employees agents representatives and other third parties with which we associate throughout the world properly adhere to them failure by us our employees or any of these third parties to adhere to our policies or applicable laws or regulations could result in penalties sanctions damage to our reputation and related costs which in turn could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flow 

our attempts to expand our business into new markets may not be successful 

while our historical focus has been to serve the north american cruise market we have expanded our focus to increase our international guest sourcing including sourcing from the brazilian asian and australian markets expansion into new markets requires significant levels of investment there can be no assurance that these markets will develop as anticipated or that we will have success in these markets and if we do not we may be unable to recover our investment which could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

ship construction repair or revitalization delays or mechanical faults may result in cancellation of cruises or unscheduled drydocks and repairs and thus adversely affect our results of operations 

we depend on shipyards to construct repair and revitalize our cruise ships on a timely basis and in good working order the sophisticated nature of building a ship involves risks delays or mechanical faults in ship construction or revitalization have in the past and may in the future result in delays or cancellation of cruises or necessitate unscheduled drydocks and repairs of ships these events and any related adverse publicity could result in lost revenue increased operating expenses or both and thus adversely affect our results of operations 

shipyards and their subcontractors may experience financial difficulties which could cause or result in delay ship cancellations our inability to procure new capacity in a timely fashion or increases in shipbuilding costs that could adversely affect our results of operations 

we rely on shipyards to construct repair and revitalize our vessels financial difficulties liquidations or closures suffered by these shipyards andor their subcontractors may impact the timely delivery or costs of new ships or the ability of shipyards to repair and revitalize our fleet in accordance with our needs or expectations the shipyard that is building the two newbuilds for our tui cruises joint venture is currently experiencing financial difficulties we have engaged in discussions with the shipyard to assess the impact on the ships they are building for tui cruises this situation could have a material impact on the ability of the shipyard to deliver these ships in accordance with the terms of the contract the costs borne by tui cruises associated with these ships andor the financial support that we may need to provide eg parent guarantees additional equity contributions to seek to ensure timely completion 

in addition there are a limited number of shipyards with the capability and capacity to build our new vessels and accordingly closures or consolidation in the cruise shipyard industry could impact our ability to construct new vessels when and as planned andor could result in stronger bargaining power on the part of the shipyards and thus higher prices for our future ship orders delivery delays and cancelled deliveries can adversely affect our results of operations as can any constraints on our ability to build repair and maintain our ships on a timely basis 

our operating costs especially fuel expenditures could increase due to market forces and economic or geopolitical factors beyond our control 

expenditures for fuel represent a significant cost of operating our business if fuel prices rise significantly in a short period of time we may be unable to increase fares or other fees sufficiently to offset fully our increased fuel costs we routinely hedge a portion of our future fuel requirements to protect against rising fuel costs however there can be no assurance that our hedge contracts will provide a sufficient level of protection against increased fuel costs or that our counterparties will be able to perform under our hedge contracts such as in the case of a counterpartys bankruptcy further volatility in fuel prices or disruptions in fuel supplies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

our other operating costs including food payroll airfare taxes insurance and security costs are all subject to increases due to market forces and economic or political conditions or other factors beyond our control increases in these operating costs could adversely affect our profitability 

unavailability of ports of call may adversely affect our results of operations  

we believe that port destinations are a major reason why guests choose to go on a particular cruise or on a cruise vacation the availability of ports is affected by a number of factors including existing capacity constraints constraints related to the size of certain ships security concerns adverse weather conditions and natural disasters financial limitations on port development exclusivity arrangements that ports may have with our competitors local governmental regulations and local community concerns about port development and other adverse impacts on their communities from additional tourists any limitations on the availability of our ports of call or on the availability of shore excursion and other service providers at such ports could adversely affect our results of operations 

price increases for commercial airline service for our guests or major changes or reduction in commercial airline service andor availability could adversely impact the demand for cruises and undermine our ability to provide reasonably priced vacation packages to our guests 

many of our guests depend on scheduled commercial airline services to transport them to or from the ports where our cruises embark or disembark increases in the price of airfare would increase the overall price of the cruise vacation to our guests which may adversely impact demand for our cruises in addition changes in the availability of commercial airline services could adversely affect our guests ability to obtain airfare as well as our ability to fly our guests to or from our cruise ships which could adversely affect our results of operations 

our reliance on travel agencies to sell and market our cruises exposes us to certain risks which if realized could adversely impact our business 

because we rely on travel agencies to generate the majority of bookings for our ships we must ensure that our commission rates and incentive structures remain competitive if we fail to offer competitive compensation packages these agencies may be incentivized to sell cruises offered by our competitors to our detriment which could adversely impact our operating results in addition the travel agent industry is sensitive to economic conditions that impact discretionary income significant disruptions especially disruptions impacting those agencies that sell a high volume of our business or contractions in the industry could reduce the number of travel agencies available for us to market and sell our cruises which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

disruptions in our shoreside operations or our information systems may adversely affect our results of operations 

our principal executive office and principal shoreside operations are located at the port of miami florida and we have call centers for reservations throughout the world although we have developed disaster recovery and similar contingency plans actual or threatened natural disasters eg hurricanes earthquakes tornados fires floods or similar events in these locations may have a material impact on our business continuity reputation and results of operations in addition substantial or repeated information systems failures computer viruses cyberattacks impacting our shoreside or shipboard operations could adversely impact our business we do not carry business interruption insurance for the majority of our shoreside operations or our information systems as such any losses or damages incurred by us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

failure to develop the value of our brands and differentiate our products could adversely affect our results of operations 

our success depends on the strength and continued development of our cruise brands and on the effectiveness of our brand strategies failure to protect and differentiate our brands from competitors throughout the vacation market could adversely affect our results of operations 

the loss of key personnel our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel or disruptions among our shipboard personnel due to strained employee relations could adversely affect our results of operations 

our success depends in large part on the skills and contributions of key executives and other employees and on our ability to recruit and retain high quality employees we must continue to recruit retain and motivate management and other employees sufficient to maintain our current business and support our projected growth furthermore as of december 31 2012 80 of our shipboard employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements a dispute under our collective bargaining agreements could result in a work stoppage of those employees covered by the agreements a loss of key employees or disruptions among our personnel could adversely affect our results of operations 

business activities that involve our coinvestment with third parties may subject us to additional risks 

partnerships joint ventures and other business structures involving our coinvestment with third parties such as our joint venture to operate tui cruises generally include some form of shared control over the operations of the business and create additional risks including the possibility that other investors in such ventures could become bankrupt or otherwise lack the financial resources to meet their obligations or could have or develop business interests policies or objectives that are inconsistent with ours in addition actions by another investor may present additional risks of operational difficulties or reputational or legal concerns 

a failure to keep pace with developments in technology or technological obsolescence could impair our operations or competitive position 

our business continues to demand the use of sophisticated technology and systems these technologies and systems must be refined updated andor replaced with more advanced systems in order to continue to meet our customers demands and expectations if we are unable to do so in a timely manner or within reasonable cost parameters or if we are unable to appropriately and timely train our employees to operate any of these new systems our business could suffer we also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new technology or system and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could impair our operating results 

a change in our tax status under the united states internal revenue code or other jurisdictions may have adverse effects on our income  

we and a number of our subsidiaries are foreign corporations that derive income from a united states trade or business andor from sources within the united states drinker biddle  reath llp our united states tax counsel has delivered to us an opinion based on certain representations and assumptions set forth in it to the effect that this income to the extent derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships is exempt from united states federal income tax pursuant to section 883 of the internal revenue code we believe that most of our income including that of our subsidiaries is derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships 

the provisions of section 883 are subject to change at any time by legislation moreover changes could occur in the future with respect to the identity residence or holdings of our direct or indirect shareholders trading volume or trading frequency of our shares or relevant foreign tax laws of liberia or malta such that they no longer qualify as equivalent exemption jurisdictions that could affect our eligibility for the section 883 exemption accordingly there can be no assurance that we will continue to be exempt from united states income tax on united states source shipping income in the future if we were not entitled to the benefit of section 883 we and our subsidiaries would be subject to united states taxation on a portion of the income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships which would reduce our net income 

additionally portions of our business are operated by companies that are within tonnage tax regimes of the uk and malta further some of the operations of these companies are conducted in jurisdictions where we rely on tax treaties to provide exemption from taxation to the extent the tonnage tax laws of these countries change or we do not continue to meet the applicable qualification requirements or if tax treaties are changed or revoked we may be required to pay higher income tax in these jurisdictions resulting in lower net income 

as budgetary constraints continue to adversely impact the jurisdictions in which we operate increases in income tax regulations or tax reform affecting our operations may be imposed 

we are not a united states corporation and our shareholders may be subject to the uncertainties of a foreign legal system in protecting their interests 

our corporate affairs are governed by our articles of incorporation and bylaws and by the business corporation act of liberia the provisions of the business corporation act of liberia resemble provisions of the corporation laws of a number of states in the united states however while most states have a fairly well developed body of case law interpreting their respective corporate statutes there are very few judicial cases in liberia interpreting the business corporation act of liberia as such the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under liberian law are not as clearly established as the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in certain united states jurisdictions for example the right of shareholders to bring a derivative action in liberian courts may be more limited than in united states jurisdictions there may also be practical difficulties for shareholders attempting to bring suit in liberia and liberian courts may or may not recognize and enforce foreign judgments thus our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests with respect to actions by management directors or controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a united states jurisdiction 

litigation enforcement actions fines or penalties could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations andor damage our reputation 

our business is subject to various united states and international laws and regulations that could lead to enforcement actions fines civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims and damages in addition improper conduct by our employees agents or joint venture partners could damage our reputation andor lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties including substantial monetary fines in certain circumstances it may not be economical to defend against such matters andor a legal strategy may not ultimately result in us prevailing in a matter such events could lead to an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

provisions of our articles of incorporation bylaws and liberian law could inhibit others from acquiring us prevent a change of control and may prevent efforts by our shareholders to change our management 

certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and liberian law may inhibit third parties from effectuating a change of control of the company without board approval which could result in the entrenchment of current management these include provisions in our articles of incorporation that prevent third parties other than a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates from acquiring beneficial ownership of more than 49 of our outstanding shares without the consent of our board of directors

 item 3 legal proceedings 

between august 1 2011 and september 8 2011 three similar purported class action lawsuits were filed against us and certain of our current and former officers in the us district court of the southern district of florida the cases have since been consolidated and a consolidated amended complaint was filed on february 17 2012 the consolidated amended complaint was filed on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of our common stock during the period from october 26 2010 through july 27 2011 and names the company our chairman and ceo our cfo the president and ceo of our royal caribbean international brand and the former president and ceo of our celebrity cruises brand as defendants the consolidated amended complaint alleges violations of section 10b of the securities exchange act of 1934 and sec rule 10b5 as well as in the case of the individual defendants the control person provisions of the securities exchange act the complaint principally alleges that the defendants knowingly made incorrect statements concerning the companys outlook for 2011 by not taking into proper account lagging european and mediterranean bookings the consolidated amended complaint seeks unspecified damages interest and attorneys fees we filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on april 9 2012 briefing on that motion was completed on august 2 2012 the motion is currently pending we believe the claims made against us are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against them 

a class action complaint was filed in june 2011 against royal caribbean cruises ltd in the united states district court for the southern district of florida on behalf of a purported class of stateroom attendants employed onboard royal caribbean international cruise vessels alleging that they were required to pay other crew members to help with their duties in violation of the us seamans wage act the lawsuit also alleges that certain stateroom attendants were required to work back of house assignments without the ability to earn gratuities in violation of the us seamans wage act plaintiffs seek judgment for damages wage penalties and interest in an indeterminate amount in may 2012 the court granted our motion to dismiss the complaint on the basis that the applicable collective bargaining agreement requires any such claims to be arbitrated plaintiffs appeal of this decision was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction by the united states court of appeals 11th circuit plaintiffs are seeking to renew their appeal we believe the appeal is without merit as are the underlying claims made against us and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against them 

because of the inherent uncertainty as to the outcome of the proceedings described above we are unable at this time to estimate the possible impact of these matters on us 

we are routinely involved in other claims typical within the cruise vacation industry the majority of these claims are covered by insurance we believe the outcome of such claims net of expected insurance recoveries will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations and cash flows

overview 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations has been organized to present the following 

• a review of our critical accounting policies and review of our financial presentation including discussion of certain operational and financial metrics we utilize to assist us in managing our business • a discussion of our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 and the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 • a discussion of our business outlook including our expectations for selected financial items for the first quarter and full year of 2013 and • a discussion of our liquidity and capital resources including our future capital and contractual commitments and potential funding sources 41 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap see note 1 general and note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  certain of our accounting policies are deemed critical as they require managements highest degree of judgment estimates and assumptions we have discussed these accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors we believe our most critical accounting policies are as follows 

ship accounting 

our ships represent our most significant assets and are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization depreciation of ships is generally computed net of a 15 projected residual value using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of the asset which is generally 30 years the 30 year useful life of our newly constructed ships and 15 associated residual value are both based on the weightedaverage of all major components of a ship our useful life and residual value estimates take into consideration the impact of anticipated technological changes longterm cruise and vacation market conditions and historical useful lives of similarlybuilt ships in addition we take into consideration our estimates of the weightedaverage useful lives of the ships major component systems such as hull superstructure main electric engines and cabins given the very large and complex nature of our ships our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain we do not have cost segregation studies performed to specifically componentize our ship systems therefore we estimate the costs of component systems based principally on general and technical information known about major ship component systems and their lives and our knowledge of the cruise vacation industry we do not identify and track depreciation by ship component systems but instead utilize these estimates to determine the net cost basis of assets replaced or refurbished improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized as additions to the ship and depreciated over the shorter of the improvements estimated useful lives or that of the associated ship the estimated cost and accumulated depreciation of replaced or refurbished ship components are written off and any resulting losses are recognized in cruise operating expenses 

we use the deferral method to account for drydocking costs under the deferral method drydocking costs incurred are deferred and charged to expense on a straightline basis over the period to the next scheduled drydock which we estimate to be a period of thirty to sixty months based on the vessels age as required by class deferred drydock costs consist of the costs to drydock the vessel and other costs incurred in connection with the drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessels class certification class certification is necessary in order for our cruise ships to be flagged in a specific country obtain liability insurance and legally operate as passenger cruise ships the activities associated with those drydocking costs cannot be performed while the vessel is in service and as such are done during a drydock as a planned major maintenance activity the significant deferred drydock costs consist of hauling and wharfage services provided by the drydock facility hull inspection and related activities eg scraping pressure cleaning bottom painting maintenance to steering propulsion stabilizers thruster equipment and ballast tanks port services such as tugs pilotage and line handling and freight associated with these items we perform a detailed analysis of the various activities performed for each drydock and only defer those costs that are directly related to planned major maintenance activities necessary to maintain class the costs deferred are not otherwise routinely periodically performed to maintain a vessels designed and intended operating capability repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred 

we use judgment when estimating the period between drydocks which can result in adjustments to the estimated amortization of drydock costs if the vessel is disposed of before the next drydock the remaining balance in deferred drydock is writtenoff to the gain or loss upon disposal of vessel in the period in which the sale takes place we also use judgment when identifying costs incurred during a drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessels class certification as compared to those costs attributable to repairs and maintenance which are expensed as incurred see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

we believe we have made reasonable estimates for ship accounting purposes however should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimates of ship useful lives or projected residual values depreciation expense could be materially higher or lower if circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making determinations as to whether ship improvements should be capitalized the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance costs could increase partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense if we had reduced our estimated average 30year ship useful life by one year depreciation expense for 2012 would have increased by approximately 404 million if our ships were estimated to have no residual value depreciation expense for 2012 would have increased by approximately 1667 million 

valuation of goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets and longlived assets 

we review goodwill trademarks and trade names which are our most significant indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or when events or circumstances dictate more frequently the impairment review for goodwill consists of a qualitative assessment of whether it is morelikelythannot that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount and if necessary a twostep goodwill impairment test factors to consider when performing the qualitative assessment include general economic conditions limitations on accessing capital changes in forecasted operating results changes in fuel prices and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates if the qualitative assessment demonstrates that it is morelikelythannot that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value it is not necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to step one for any reporting unit in any period we can resume the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any subsequent period 

when performing the twostep goodwill impairment test the fair value of the reporting unit is determined and compared to the carrying value of the net assets allocated to the reporting unit we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a probabilityweighted discounted cash flow model the estimation of fair value utilizing discounted expected future cash flows includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of expected revenues operating costs marketing selling and administrative expenses interest rates ship additions and retirements as well as assumptions regarding the cruise vacation industrys competitive environment and general economic and business conditions among other factors the principal assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model are projected operating results weightedaverage cost of capital and terminal value the discounted cash flow model uses our 2013 projected operating results as a base to that base we add future years cash flows assuming multiple revenue and expense scenarios that reflect the impact of different global economic environments beyond 2013 on the reporting unit we discount the projected cash flows using rates specific to the reporting unit based on its weightedaverage cost of capital if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value no further analysis or writedown of goodwill is required if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of its net assets the implied fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all its underlying assets and liabilities including both recognized and unrecognized tangible and intangible assets based on their fair value if necessary goodwill is then written down to its implied fair value 

the impairment review for indefinitelife intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount we estimate the fair value of our indefinitelife intangible assets which consist of trademarks and trade names related to pullmantur using a discounted cash flow model and the relieffromroyalty method the royalty rate used is based on comparable royalty agreements in the tourism and hospitality industry the discount rate used is comparable to the rate used in valuing the pullmantur reporting unit in our goodwill impairment test if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess if the fair value exceeds its carrying amount the indefinitelife intangible asset is not considered impaired other intangible assets assigned finite useful lives are amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives 

the factors influencing expected future cash flows for purposes of goodwill impairment testing discussed above also affect the assessment of recoverability of pullmanturs deferred tax assets pullmanturs deferred tax assets principally result from net operating loss carryforwards we regularly review deferred tax assets for recoverability based on our history of earnings expectations of future earnings and tax planning strategies realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income to support the amount of deferred tax assets a valuation allowance is recorded in those circumstances in which we conclude it is not morelikelythannot we will recover the deferred tax assets prior to their expiration 

we review our ships aircraft and other longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable we evaluate asset impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities the lowest level for which we maintain identifiable cash flows that are independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities is at the ship level for our ships and at the aggregated asset group level for our aircraft see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  if estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of an asset an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the assets estimated fair value and its carrying value 

we estimate fair value based on quoted market prices in active markets if available if active markets are not available we base fair value on independent appraisals sales price negotiations and projected future cash flows discounted at a rate estimated by management to be commensurate with the business risk quoted market prices are often not available for individual reporting units and for indefinitelife intangible assets accordingly we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit and an indefinitelife intangible asset using an expected present value technique 

impairment of pullmantur related assets 

during the fourth quarter of 2012 we performed our annual impairment review of goodwill for pullmanturs reporting unit we did not perform a qualitative assessment but instead proceeded directly to the twostep goodwill impairment test pullmantur is a brand targeted primarily at the spanish portuguese and latin american markets and although pullmantur has diversified its passenger sourcing over the past few years spain still represents pullmanturs largest market as previously disclosed european economies continued to demonstrate instability in light of heightened concerns over sovereign debt issues as well as the impact of proposed austerity measures on certain markets the spanish economy was more severely impacted than many other economies and there is significant uncertainty as to when it will recover in addition the impact of the costa concordia incident has had a more lingering effect than expected and the impact in future years is uncertain these factors were identified in the past as significant risks which could lead to the impairment of pullmanturs goodwill 

the spanish economy has progressively worsened and forecasts suggest the challenging operating environment will continue for an extended period of time the unemployment rate in spain reached 

26 during the fourth quarter of 2012 and is expected to rise further in 2013 the international monetary fund which had projected gdp growth of 18 a year ago revised its 2013 gdp projections downward for spain to a contraction of 13 during the fourth quarter of 2012 and further reduced it to a contraction of 15 in january of 2013 during the latter half of 2012 new austerity measures such as increases to the value added tax cuts to benefits the phasing out of exemptions and the suspension of government bonuses were implemented by the spanish government we believe these austerity measures are having a larger impact on consumer confidence and discretionary spending than previously anticipated as a result there has been a significant deterioration in bookings from guests sourced from spain during the 2013 wave season the combination of all of these factors has caused us to negatively adjust our cash flow projections especially our closerin net yield assumptions and the expectations regarding future capacity growth for the brand 

based on our updated cash flow projections we determined the implied fair value of goodwill was 1455 million and recognized an impairment charge of 3192 million similarly we determined that the fair value of pullmanturs trademarks and trade names no longer exceeded their carrying value accordingly we recognized an impairment charge of approximately 174 million to write down trademarks and trade names to their fair value of 2049 million 

as part of step two of our goodwill impairment analysis we identified that the estimated fair values of certain longlived assets consisting of three aircraft owned and operated by pullmantur air were less than their carrying values as a result we proceeded to our longlived asset impairment test pullmanturs strategy to further diversify its passenger sourcing and reduce its reliance on the spanish market has led us to reduce the expected years in which we will use these aircraft when performing the undiscounted cash flow test the undiscounted cash flows for pullmanturs aircraft were determined to be less than their carrying value and an impairment charge of 489 million was required 

the combined impairment charge of 3854 million related to pullmanturs goodwill trademarks and trade names and aircraft was recognized in earnings during the quarter ended december 31 2012 and is reported within impairment of pullmantur related assets within our consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss 

the factors influencing the spanish economy and pullmanturs operating cash flows discussed above also affect the recoverability of pullmanturs deferred tax assets during the fourth quarter of 2012 we updated our deferred tax asset recoverability analysis for projections included within the goodwill valuation model discussed above these projections including the impact of recently enacted laws regarding net operating loss utilization and the review of our tax planning strategies show that it is no longer morelikelythannot that we will recover the deferred tax assets prior to their expiration as such we have determined that a 100 valuation allowance of our deferred tax assets was required resulting in a deferred income tax expense of 337 million in addition pullmantur has a deferred tax liability that was recorded at the time of acquisition this liability represents the tax effect of the basis difference between the tax and book values of the trademarks and trade names that were acquired at the time of the acquisition due to the impairment charge related to these intangible assets we reduced the deferred tax liability by 52 million the net 285 million impact of these adjustments was recognized in earnings during the fourth quarter of 2012 and is reported within other expense income in our statements of comprehensive income loss 

if the spanish economy weakens further or recovers more slowly than contemplated or if the economies of other markets eg france brazil latin america perform worse than contemplated in our discounted cash flow model or if there are material changes to our projected future cash flows used in the impairment analyses especially in net yields an additional impairment charge of the pullmantur reporting units goodwill trademarks trade names and longlived assets may be required 

royal caribbean international 

during the fourth quarter of 2012 we performed a qualitative assessment of the royal caribbean international reporting unit based on our qualitative assessment we concluded that it was morelikelythannot that the estimated fair value of the royal caribbean international reporting unit exceeded its carrying value as of december 31 2012 and thus did not proceed to the twostep goodwill impairment test no indicators of impairment exist primarily because the reporting units fair value has consistently exceeded its carrying value by a significant margin its financial performance has been solid in the face of mixed economic environments and forecasts of operating results generated by the reporting unit appear sufficient to support its carrying value 

derivative instruments 

we enter into various forward swap and option contracts to manage our interest rate exposure and to limit our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices these instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value and the vast majority are designated as hedges we also have nonderivative financial instruments designated as hedges of our net investment in our foreign operations and investments the fuel options we have entered into represent economic hedges which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes and thus changes in their fair value are immediately recognized in earnings although certain of our derivative financial instruments do not qualify or are not accounted for under hedge accounting our derivative instruments are not held for trading or speculative purposes we account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with authoritative guidance refer to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies and note 13 fair value measurements and derivative instruments to our consolidated financial statements for more information on related authoritative guidance the companys hedging programs and derivative financial instruments 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and collars interest rate crosscurrency and fuel swaps and options with third party institutions in overthecounter markets we estimate the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate and crosscurrency swaps using expected future cash flows based on the instruments contract terms and published forward curves for foreign currency exchange and interest rates we apply present value techniques and liborbased discount rates to convert the expected future cash flows to the current fair value of the instruments 

we estimate the fair value of our foreign currency collars using standard option pricing models with inputs based on the options contract terms such as exercise price and maturity and readily available public market data such as foreign exchange curves foreign exchange volatility levels and discount rates 

we estimate the fair value of our fuel swaps using expected future cash flows based on the swaps contract terms and forward prices we derive forward prices from forward fuel curves based on pricing inputs provided by thirdparty institutions that transact in the fuel indices we hedge we validate these pricing inputs against actual market transactions and published price quotes for similar assets we apply present value techniques and liborbased discount rates to convert the expected future cash flows to the current fair value of the instruments we also corroborate our fair value estimates using valuations provided by our counterparties 

we estimate the fair value for our fuel call options based on the prevailing market price for the instruments consisting of published price quotes for similar assets based on recent transactions in an active market 

we adjust the valuation of our derivative financial instruments to incorporate credit risk when applicable 

we believe it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate crosscurrency and fuel swaps and options would be 

derived from other appropriate valuation models using similar assumptions inputs or conditions suggested by actual historical experience 

contingencies—litigation 

on an ongoing basis we assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss if any can be made in assessing probable losses we take into consideration estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries if any we accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recoveries it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made 

seasonality 

our revenues are seasonal based on demand for cruises demand is strongest for cruises during the northern hemispheres summer months and holidays in order to mitigate the impact of the winter weather in the northern hemisphere and to capitalize on the summer season in the southern hemisphere our brands have increased deployment to south america and australia during the northern hemisphere winter months 

financial presentation 

description of certain line items 

revenues 

our revenues are comprised of the following 

• passenger ticket revenues  which consist of revenue recognized from the sale of passenger tickets and the sale of air transportation to and from our ships and • onboard and other revenues  which consist primarily of revenues from the sale of goods andor services onboard our ships not included in passenger ticket prices cancellation fees sales of vacation protection insurance pre and postcruise tours pullmanturs landbased tours and hotel and air packages including pullmantur airs charter business to third parties   onboard and other revenues also include revenues we receive from independent third party concessionaires that pay us a percentage of their revenues in exchange for the right to provide selected goods andor services onboard our ships 

cruise operating expenses 

our cruise operating expenses are comprised of the following 

• commissions transportation and other expenses  which consist of those costs directly associated with passenger ticket revenues including travel agent commissions air and other transportation expenses port costs that vary with passenger head counts and related credit card fees • onboard and other expenses  which consist of the direct costs associated with onboard and other revenues including the costs of products sold onboard our ships vacation protection insurance premiums costs associated with pre and postcruise tours and related credit card fees as well as the minimal costs associated with concession revenues as the costs are mostly incurred by thirdparty concessionaires 47 

• payroll and related expenses  which consist of costs for shipboard personnel costs associated with our shoreside personnel are included in marketing selling and administrative expenses • food expenses  which include food costs for both guests and crew • fuel expenses  which include fuel and related delivery and storage costs including the financial impact of fuel swap agreements and • other operating expenses  which consist primarily of operating costs such as repairs and maintenance port costs that do not vary with passenger head counts vessel operating lease costs costs associated with pullmanturs landbased tours and pullmantur airs charter business to third parties vessel related insurance and entertainment we do not allocate payroll and related costs food costs fuel costs or other operating costs to the expense categories attributable to passenger ticket revenues or onboard and other revenues since they are incurred to provide the total cruise vacation experience 

selected operational and financial metrics 

we utilize a variety of operational and financial metrics which are defined below to evaluate our performance and financial condition as discussed in more detail herein certain of these metrics are nongaap financial measures which we believe provide useful information to investors as a supplement to our consolidated financial statements which are prepared and presented in accordance with gaap the presentation of nongaap financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap 

  available passenger cruise days apcd is our measurement of capacity and represents double occupancy per cabin multiplied by the number of cruise days for the period we use this measure to perform capacity and rate analysis to identify our main noncapacity drivers that cause our cruise revenue and expenses to vary 

  gross cruise costs represent the sum of total cruise operating expenses plus marketing selling and administrative expenses 

  gross yields represent total revenues per apcd 

  net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel represent gross cruise costs excluding commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses and in the case of net cruise costs excluding fuel fuel expenses each of which is described above under the description of certain line items heading in measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income we believe changes in net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance a reconciliation of historical gross cruise costs to net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel is provided below under results of operations  we have not provided a quantitative reconciliation of projected gross cruise costs to projected net cruise costs and projected net cruise costs excluding fuel due to the significant uncertainty in projecting the costs deducted to arrive at these measures accordingly we do not believe that reconciling information for such projected figures would be meaningful 

  net debttocapital is a ratio which represents total longterm debt including current portion of longterm debt less cash and cash equivalents net debt divided by the sum of net debt and total shareholders equity we believe net debt and net debttocapital along with total longterm debt and shareholders equity are useful measures of our capital structure a reconciliation of historical debttocapital to net debttocapital is provided below under results of operations 

  net revenues represent total revenues less commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses each of which is described above under the description of certain line items heading 

  net yields represent net revenues per apcd we utilize net revenues and net yields to manage our business on a daytoday basis as we believe that it is the most relevant measure of our pricing performance because it reflects the cruise revenues earned by us net of our most significant variable costs which are commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses a reconciliation of historical gross yields to net yields is provided below under results of operations  we have not provided a quantitative reconciliation of projected gross yields to projected net yields due to the significant uncertainty in projecting the costs deducted to arrive at this measure accordingly we do not believe that reconciling information for such projected figures would be meaningful 

  occupancy  in accordance with cruise vacation industry practice is calculated by dividing passenger cruise days by apcd a percentage in excess of 100 indicates that three or more passengers occupied some cabins 

  passenger cruise days represent the number of passengers carried for the period multiplied by the number of days of their respective cruises 

we believe that the impairment charges recognized in 2012 related to pullmanturs goodwill trademarks trade names and longlived assets and the charges related to the adjustments to pullmanturs deferred tax assets and deferred tax liability the impairment related charges are not an indication of our future earnings performance as such we believe it is more meaningful for the impairment related charges to be excluded from our net income and earnings per share and accordingly we have elected to also present nongaap net income and nongaap eps excluding these impairment related charges for the year ended december 31 2012 

we believe net yields net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel are our most relevant nongaap financial measures however a significant portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar because our reporting currency is the united states dollar the value of these revenues and expenses can be affected by changes in currency exchange rates although such changes in local currency prices is just one of many elements impacting our revenues and expenses it can be an important element for this reason we also monitor net yields net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel as if the current periods currency exchange rates had remained constant with the comparable prior periods rates or on a constant currency basis 

it should be emphasized that constant currency is primarily used for comparing shortterm changes andor projections over the longer term changes in guest sourcing and shifting the amount of purchases between currencies can significantly change the impact of the purely currencybased fluctuations 

the use of certain significant nongaap measures such as net yields net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel allow us to perform capacity and rate analysis to separate the impact of known capacity changes from other less predictable changes which affect our business we believe these nongaap measures provide expanded insight to measure revenue and cost performance in addition to the standard united states gaap based financial measures there are no specific rules or regulations for determining nongaap and constant currency measures and as such there exists the possibility that they may not be comparable to other companies within the industry 

executive overview 

we believe our results of operations for 2012 demonstrate the strength and resiliency of our brands and the value proposition of a cruise vacation despite the slow pace of the economic recovery and the continued instability in the global economic landscape especially in europe our net income for 2012 before the impairment related charges was 4322 million and our net yields increased 15 during the fourth quarter of 2012 we recognized an impairment charge of 3854 million to write down pullmanturs goodwill to its implied fair value and to write down trademarks and trade names and certain longlived assets consisting of three aircraft owned and operated by pullmantur air to their fair value in addition we recognized a 337 million charge to record a 100 valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets for pullmantur and we reduced the deferred tax liability related to pullmanturs trademarks and trade names by 52 million as a result our net income for 2012 was 183 million as compared to 6074 million for 2011 which was not impacted by the impairment related charges 

our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2012 were also negatively impacted by the effect of the costa concordia incident on booking patterns throughout the industry these effects were magnified by the timing of the incident which occurred in early 2012 during wave season traditionally the first two months of the year where cruise lines experience disproportionately higher volume cruise sales we continue to believe the impact of the costa concordia incident will not have a significant long term impact on our business 

our results of operations were also influenced by changes to our international distribution system mainly in brazil implemented in late 2011 pursuant to which we began directly distributing certain of our cruises rather than indirectly distributing them through charter arrangements in addition our results were impacted by certain deployment initiatives including but not limited to increased deployment in australia and china 

our continued focus on cost control has helped us to maintain our profitability despite a tough operating environment with upward pressure on costs we intend to continue these efforts during 2013 in addition during 2013 we will continue to strengthen our revenue enhancement opportunities by strategically investing in a number of projects including the introduction of beverage packages fleet wide retail and casino enhancements the continuation of our vessel revitalization program the introduction of new onboard revenue initiatives and various information technology infrastructure investments we also intend to enhance our focus on identifying the needs of our guests and creating product features that our customers value we are focused on targeting highvalue guests by better understanding consumer data and insights and creating communication strategies that best resonate with our target audiences in 2013 we will continue to focus on the development of key markets in asia and we will focus on sourcing guests and adding capacity to other markets where we expect significant growth and profitability such as australia we believe these initiatives will provide opportunities for increased ticket and onboard revenues with the ultimate goal of maximizing our longterm return on invested capital and shareholder value 

during 2012 we took delivery of celebrity reflection the fifth and final solsticeclass ship and ordered a third oasisclass ship through a conditional agreement the agreement is subject to certain closing conditions and is expected to become effective in the first quarter of 2013 the ship is scheduled for delivery in the second quarter of 2016 we also have two quantumclass ships on order for royal caribbean international which are expected to enter service in the third quarter of 2014 and in the second quarter of 2015 respectively and two ships on order for our joint venture tui cruises which are scheduled for delivery in the second quarter of 2014 and second quarter of 2015 respectively as part of our vessel revitalization program five ships were revitalized for the royal caribbean international brand during 2012 by the end of 2013 we expect that all of the visionclass and freedomclass ships and all but one of the radianceclass ships will have been revitalized for the 

celebrity cruises brand two ships underwent revitalization during 2012 to incorporate certain solsticeclass features by the end of 2013 the millenniumclass revitalization program will be complete as the final ship is scheduled to be revitalized during the course of 2013 

as of december 31 2012 our liquidity position remained strong at 22 billion consisting of approximately 1949 million in cash and cash equivalents and 20 billion available under our unsecured credit facilities in addition we continue to be focused on our goal of returning to an investment grade credit rating we have already made strides in this direction and further improvements are anticipated through increasing operating cash flow a moderate capital expenditure program retiring of debt and favorable financing programs 

in 2012 we implemented a number of actions in furtherance of our refinancing strategy for our maturities in 2013 and 2014 these actions which enabled us to refinance a portion of our outstanding indebtedness with later maturity debt without increasing our total level of indebtedness included 

• obtaining funds through the incurrence of 9400 million of new debt obligations including 6500 million of 525 unsecured senior notes due november 2022 and a 2900 million unsecured term loan due february 2016 with these funds we were able to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facilities and repurchase €2550 million or approximately 3280 million in aggregate principal amount of our €10 billion 5625 unsecured senior notes due 2014 and • our establishment of new borrowing capacity including €3650 million in available capacity under a eurodenominated unsecured term loan due july 2017 to be drawn at any time on or prior to june 30 2013 and 2330 million of additional revolving credit capacity utilizing the accordion feature on our revolving facility due july 2016 during 2013 it is likely we will secure additional liquidity in the capital andor credit markets as part of our refinancing strategy for our upcoming 2013 and 2014 maturities we anticipate funding these maturities and other obligations in 2013 through a combination of currently available and anticipated new credit facilities and other financing arrangements and operating cash flows 

results of operations

revenues 

total revenues for 2012 increased 1508 million or 20 to 77 billion from 75 billion in 2011 despite the impact of the costa concordia incident and the continued instability in the global economic landscape especially in europe our passenger ticket revenues increased 687 million or 12 to 56 billion from 55 billion in 2011 and our onboard and other revenues increased 821 million or 41 to 21 billion from 20 billion in 2011 

approximately 1711 million of the increase in total revenues was driven by an increase in pullmanturs landbased tours hotel and air packages an increase in onboard spending on a per passenger basis and an increase in concession revenues the increase in pullmanturs landbased tours hotel and air packages was attributable to an increase in guests and the addition of new itineraries the increase in onboard spending was primarily due to the addition of specialty restaurants and other onboard activities as a result of our ship revitalization projects and other revenue enhancing initiatives the increase in concession revenues was due to an increase in spending on a per passenger basis in addition the increase in total revenues was partially attributable to changes to our international distribution system mainly in brazil and certain deployment initiatives including but not limited to increased deployment in australia and china as described above these increases were partially offset by the unfavorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar of approximately 1269 million 

approximately 1066 million of the increase in total revenues was attributable to a 14 increase in capacity the increase in capacity was primarily due to the addition of celebrity silhouette which entered service in july 2011 and the addition of celebrity reflection which entered service in october 2012 this increase in capacity was partially offset by the sale of celebrity mercury to tui cruises in february 2011 and the completion of our oneyear charter of the bleu de france in november 2011 following its sale to a third party in november 2010 we consolidate the operating results of pullmantur and its whollyowned subsidiary cdf croisières de france on a twomonth lag to allow for more timely preparation of our consolidated financial statements see note 1 general to our consolidated 

financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  the increase in capacity was also partially offset by the delivery of ocean dream to an unrelated third party in april 2012 as part of a six year bareboat charter agreement 

cruise operating expenses 

total cruise operating expenses for 2012 increased 2148 million or 43 to 52 billion from 49 billion for 2011 approximately 2194 million of this increase was attributable to increases in fuel expenses and expenses related to pullmanturs landbased tours hotel and air packages fuel expenses which are net of the financial impact of fuel swap agreements accounted for as hedges increased 152 per metric ton in 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily as a result of increasing fuel prices the increase in pullmanturs landbased tours hotel and air packages expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in guests and the addition of new itineraries these increases were partially offset by a decrease in commissions expenses attributable to increased charter business and changes in our distribution channels in addition 699 million of the increase in cruise operating expenses was attributable to the 14 increase in capacity mentioned above these increases in cruise operating expenses were partially offset by the favorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our cruise operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar of approximately 745 million 

marketing selling and administrative expenses 

  marketing selling and administrative expenses for 2012 increased 509 million or 53 to 10 billion from 9606 million for 2011 the increase was due to an increase in costs associated with investments in technology and to an increase in advertising expenses related to our global expansion these increases were partially offset by the favorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our marketing selling and administrative expenses denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar 

depreciation and amortization expenses 

  depreciation and amortization expenses for 2012 increased 281 million or 40 to 7305 million from 7024 million for 2011 the increase was primarily due to the addition of celebrity silhouette which entered service in july 2011 the addition of celebrity reflection which entered service in october 2012 and to new shipboard additions associated with our ship revitalization projects this increase was partially offset by the sale of celebrity mercury to tui cruises in february 2011 

impairment of pullmantur related assets 

during 2012 we recognized an impairment charge of 3854 million to write down pullmanturs goodwill to its implied fair value and to write down trademarks and trade names and certain longlived assets consisting of three aircraft owned and operated by pullmantur air to their fair value see valuation of goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets and longlived assets above for more information regarding the impairment of these assets 

other income expense 

  interest expense net of interest capitalized  decreased to 3558 million in 2012 from 3824 million in 2011 the decrease was due to lower interest rates and a lower average debt level 

  other expense was 504 million in 2012 compared to other income of 329 million in 2011 for a net change of 833 million when comparing these periods the change in other expense was primarily due to the following 

• deferred income tax expense of 337 million as a result of a 100 valuation allowance recorded in connection with pullmanturs deferred tax assets that are no longer expected to be recovered prior to their expiration • a reduction in deferred income tax expense of 52 million due to a reduction in pullmanturs deferred tax liability related to the impairment charge of pullmanturs trademarks and trade names • a loss of 57 million associated with changes in the fair value of our fuel call options in 2012 as compared to a gain of 189 million in 2011 for a net change of 246 million • a loss of 27 million due to ineffectiveness on our fuel swaps in 2012 as compared to a gain of 71 million in 2011 for a net change of 98 million • a loss of 75 million on the early extinguishment of €2550 million or approximately 3280 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding €10 billion unsecured senior notes due 2014 in september 2012 net yields 

net yields increased 15 in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due an increase in pullmanturs land based tours hotel and air packages revenue and an increase in onboard spending in addition the increase was due to the changes in our international distribution system mainly in brazil and certain deployment initiatives net yields increased 30 in 2012 compared to 2011 on a constant currency basis 

net cruise costs 

net cruise costs increased 69 in 2012 compared to 2011 due to the 14 increase in capacity and a 54 increase in net cruise cost per apcd the increase in net cruise costs per apcd was primarily due to an increase in fuel and pullmanturs landbased tours hotel and air packages expenses as discussed above in addition the increase in net cruise cost per apcd was due to the changes in our international distribution system mainly in brazil and certain deployment initiatives net cruise costs per apcd increased 68 in 2012 compared to 2011 on a constant currency basis net cruise costs excluding fuel per apcd increased 27 in 2012 compared to 2011 net cruise costs excluding fuel per apcd increased 42 in 2012 compared to 2011 on a constant currency basis

  in this section references to 2011 refer to the year ended december 31 2011 and references to 2010 refer to the year ended december 31 2010 

revenues 

total revenues for 2011 increased 7848 million or 116 to 75 billion from 68 billion in 2010 approximately 5078 million of this increase was attributable to a 75 increase in capacity the increase in capacity was primarily due to a full year of revenue generated by allure of the seas which entered service in december 2010 the addition of celebrity silhouette which entered service in july 2011 and a full year of celebrity eclipse which entered service in april 2010 this increase in capacity was partially offset by the sale of celebrity mercury to tui cruises in february 2011 in addition approximately 2770 million of the increase in revenue was driven by an increase in ticket prices and 

the favorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar these increases were partially mitigated by the impact of geopolitical events including the political unrest in the eastern mediterranean and northern africa and the earthquake and related events in japan which offset pricing improvements in other regions these events resulted in deployment changes to avoid calling on ports in those areas and pricing reductions to stimulate demand in other areas 

  onboard and other revenues included concession revenues of 2734 million in 2011 compared to 2370 million for the same period in 2010 the increase in concession revenues was due to an increase in spending on a per passenger basis and the increase in capacity mentioned above 

cruise operating expenses 

total cruise operating expenses for 2011 increased 4845 million or 109 to 49 billion from 45 billion for 2010 approximately 3352 million of the increase was attributable to the 75 increase in capacity mentioned above other significant drivers of the increase include an increase in fuel air and other hotel and vessel expenses and head taxes as well as the unfavorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our cruise operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar fuel expenses which are net of the financial impact of fuel swap agreements increased 184 per metric ton in 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily as a result of increasing fuel prices the increase in air and other hotel and vessel expenses and head taxes were primarily due to deployment changes 

marketing selling and administrative expenses 

  marketing selling and administrative expenses for 2011 increased 1125 million or 133 to 9606 million from 8481 million for 2010 the increase was due to an increase in marketing selling and payroll expenses primarily associated with our international expansion and to a much lesser extent an increase in expenses associated with technological innovations 

depreciation and amortization expenses 

  depreciation and amortization expenses for 2011 increased 587 million or 91 to 7024 million from 6437 million for 2010 the increase is primarily due to a full year of allure of the seas which entered service in december 2010 the addition of celebrity silhouette which entered service in july 2011 and a full year of celebrity eclipse which entered service in april 2010 these increases were partially offset by the sale of celebrity mercury to tui cruises and the sale of bleu de france  

other income expense 

  interest expense net of interest capitalized  increased to 3824 million in 2011 from 3712 million in 2010 the increase was due to a reduction in interest capitalized for ships under construction interest capitalized decreased to 140 million in 2011 from 281 million in 2010 primarily due to a lower average level of investment in ships under construction gross interest expense decreased to 3964 million from 3993 million in 2010 the decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates partially offset by a higher average debt level 

  other income decreased to 329 million in 2011 from 750 million in 2010 the 421 million decrease in other income was due primarily to an 890 million gain recorded from a litigation settlement during 2010 that did not recur in 2011 which was partially offset by 

• income on our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries of 222 million in 2011 as compared to income of 02 million in 2010 for a net increase of 220 million when comparing these periods 59 

• a gain on our fuel call options of 189 million in 2011 as compared to a loss of 28 million in 2010 for a net change of 217 million net yields 

net yields increased 41 in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to an increase in ticket prices and the favorable impact of changes in exchange rates as discussed above net yields per apcd increased 24 in 2011 compared to 2010 on a constant currency basis 

net cruise costs 

net cruise costs increased 114 in 2011 compared to 2010 due to the 75 increase in capacity and a 37 increase in net cruise cost per apcd the increase in net cruise costs per apcd was primarily driven by an increase in fuel and other hotel and vessel expenses and to a lesser extent the unfavorable impact of changes in exchange rates as discussed above net cruise costs per apcd increased 27 in 2011 compared to 2010 on a constant currency basis net cruise costs excluding fuel per apcd increased 23 in 2011 compared to 2010 net cruise costs excluding fuel per apcd increased 13 in 2011 compared to 2010 on a constant currency basis

liquidity and capital resources 

sources and uses of cash 

cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity net cash provided by operating activities decreased 740 million to 14 billion for 2012 compared to 15 billion for 2011 this decrease was primarily a result of a decrease in net income after adjusting for noncash items and to the timing of collections on our trade accounts receivable partially offset by a higher rate of increase in customer deposits and an increase in cash received on the settlement of derivative financial instruments 

  net cash used in investing activities was 13 billion for 2012 compared to 9246 million for 2011 the change was primarily due to 2900 million of proceeds received from the sale of celebrity mercury and 550 million of proceeds received from the sale of bleu de france during 2011 which did not recur in 2012 during 2012 our use of cash was primarily related to capital expenditures of 13 billion up from 12 billion for 2011 the increase in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to an increase in payments related to our ship revitalization projects in 2012 we also provided 1107 million under a debt facility to one of our unconsolidated affiliates during 2011 which did not recur in 2012 

  net cash used in financing activities was 1796 million for 2012 compared to 6765 million for 2011 primarily as a result of our refinancing strategy for our upcoming 2013 and 2014 maturities the change was due to a net increase in debt facility drawings of 9801 million during 2012 as compared to 2011 the net increase in debt facility drawings was primarily due to proceeds received from the issuance of 6500 million unsecured senior notes and amounts borrowed under an unsecured term loan of 2900 million during 2012 which did not occur in 2011 the change in net cash used in financing activities was also due to an increase in repayments of debt of approximately 3822 million the increase in repayments of debt was primarily due to an increase of 5900 million in repayments on our unsecured revolving credit facilities from 8850 million during 2011 to 15 billion during 2012 the increase in repayments of debt was also due 3446 million paid in conjunction with the repurchase of €2550 million 

or approximately 3280 million in aggregate principal amount of our €10 billion 5625 unsecured senior notes and the prepayment of a 1000 million unsecured term loan during 2012 as compared to the repayment of a 5000 million unsecured senior note and a prepayment of 2000 million on our allure of the seas unsecured term loan during 2011 the change was also due to cash dividends paid on our common stock of 1177 million for 2012 as compared to 217 million for 2011 

future capital commitments 

our future capital commitments consist primarily of new ship orders as of december 31 2012 we had two quantumclass ships and one oasisclass ship on order for our royal caribbean international brand with an aggregate capacity of approximately 13600 berths the agreement for our oasisclass ship is subject to certain closing conditions and is expected to become effective in the first quarter of 2013 we also have an option to construct a fourth oasisclass ship which will expire five days prior to the first anniversary of the effective date of the contract 

as of december 31 2012 the aggregate cost of our ships on order was approximately 36 billion of which we had deposited 1310 million as of such date approximately 497 of the aggregate cost was exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate at december 31 2012 see note 13 fair value measurements and derivative instruments and note 14 commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

as of december 31 2012 we anticipated overall capital expenditures will be approximately 07 billion for 2013 12 billion for 2014 12 billion for 2015 and 13 billion for 2016 

contractual obligations 

as of december 31 2012 our contractual obligations were as follows in thousands 



1 we are obligated under noncancelable operating leases primarily for a ship offices warehouses and motor vehicles 2 under the brilliance of the seas lease agreement we may be required to make a termination payment of approximately £654 million or approximately 1063 million based on the exchange rate at december 31 2012 if the lease is canceled in 2020 this amount is included in the more than 5 years column 3 longterm debt obligations mature at various dates through fiscal year 2027 and bear interest at fixed and variable rates interest on variablerate debt is calculated based on forecasted debt 

balances including interest swapped using the applicable rate at december 31 2012 debt denominated in other currencies is calculated based on the applicable exchange rate at december 31 2012 

4 amounts represent future commitments with remaining terms in excess of one year to pay for our usage of certain port facilities marine consumables services and maintenance contracts 5 amounts represent contractual obligations with initial terms in excess of one year amounts include our third oasisclass ship which was ordered under a conditional agreement in december 2012 and is expected to become effective in the first quarter of 2013 6 amounts represent debt obligations with initial terms in excess of one year 7 amounts represent capital lease obligations with initial terms in excess of one year 8 amounts represent fees payable to sovereign guarantors in connection with certain of our export credit debt facilities and facility fees on our revolving credit facilities 

as a normal part of our business depending on market conditions pricing and our overall growth strategy we continuously consider opportunities to enter into contracts for the building of additional ships we may also consider the sale of ships or the purchase of existing ships we continuously consider potential acquisitions and strategic alliances if any of these were to occur they would be financed through the incurrence of additional indebtedness the issuance of additional shares of equity securities or through cash flows from operations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in july 2002 we entered into an operating lease denominated in british pound sterling for the brilliance of the seas  the lease payments vary based on sterling libor the lease has a contractual life of 25 years however both the lessor and we have certain rights to cancel the lease at year 18 ie 2020 upon advance notice given approximately one year prior to cancellation in the event of early termination at year 18 we have the option to cause the sale of the vessel at its fair value and to use the proceeds towards the applicable termination payment alternatively we could opt at such time to make a termination payment of approximately £654 million or approximately 1063 million based on the exchange rate at december 31 2012 and relinquish our right to cause the sale of the vessel under current circumstances we do not believe early termination of this lease is probable 

under the brilliance of the seas operating lease we have agreed to indemnify the lessor to the extent its aftertax return is negatively impacted by unfavorable changes in corporate tax rates capital allowance deductions and certain unfavorable determinations which may be made by united kingdom tax authorities these indemnifications could result in an increase in our lease payments we are unable to estimate the maximum potential increase in our lease payments due to the various circumstances timing or a combination of events that could trigger such indemnifications the united kingdom tax authorities are disputing the lessors accounting treatment of the lease and the lessor and tax authorities are in discussions on the matter if the characterization of the lease is ultimately determined to be incorrect we could be required to indemnify the lessor under certain circumstances the lessor has advised us that they believe their characterization of the lease is correct based on the foregoing and our review of available information we do not believe an indemnification payment is probable however if the lessor loses its dispute and we are required to indemnify the lessor we cannot at this time predict the impact that such an occurrence would have on our financial condition and results of operations 

in connection with the sale of celebrity mercury in february 2011 we and tui ag each guaranteed repayment of 50 of an €1800 million 5year amortizing bank loan provided to tui cruises as of december 31 2012 €1530 million or approximately 2017 million based on the exchange rate at december 31 2012 remains outstanding based on current facts and circumstances we do not believe potential obligations under this guarantee are probable 

tui cruises entered into construction agreements with stx finland that includes certain restrictions on each of our and tui ags ability to reduce our current ownership interest in tui cruises below 375 through the construction period for the first tui newbuild vessel in addition the bank credit facility agreement for the financing of the ship extends this restriction through 2019 

some of the contracts that we enter into include indemnification provisions that obligate us to make payments to the counterparty if certain events occur these contingencies generally relate to changes in taxes increased lender capital costs and other similar costs the indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms and are entered into in the normal course of business there are no stated or notional amounts included in the indemnification clauses and we are not able to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments if any under these indemnification clauses we have not been required to make any payments under such indemnification clauses in the past and under current circumstances we do not believe an indemnification obligation is probable 

other than the items described above we are not party to any other offbalance sheet arrangements including guarantee contracts retained or contingent interest certain derivative instruments and variable interest entities that either have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial position 

funding needs and sources 

we have significant contractual obligations of which the capital expenditures associated with our ship purchases and our debt service obligations represent our largest funding needs we have historically relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations drawdowns under our available credit facilities the incurrence of additional debt andor the refinancing of our existing debt and the issuance of additional shares of equity securities to fund these obligations 

we had a working capital deficit of 32 billion as of december 31 2012 as compared to a working capital deficit of 21 billion as of december 31 2011 included within our working capital deficit is 15 billion and 06 billion of current portion of longterm debt as of december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively the increase is due to the increase in current maturities of longterm debt similar to others in our industry we operate with a substantial working capital deficit this deficit is mainly attributable to the fact that under our business model a vast majority of our passenger ticket receipts are collected in advance of the applicable sailing date these advance passenger receipts remain a current liability until the sailing date the cash generated from these advance receipts is used interchangeably with cash on hand from other sources such as our revolving credit facilities and other cash from operations the cash received as advanced receipts can be used to fund operating expenses for the applicable future sailing or otherwise pay down our revolving credit facilities invest in long term investments or any other use of cash in addition we have a relatively lowlevel of accounts receivable and rapid turnover results in a limited investment in inventories we generate substantial cash flows from operations and our business model along with our unsecured revolving credit facilities has historically allowed us to maintain this working capital deficit and still meet our operating investing and financing needs we expect that we will continue to have working capital deficits in the future 

as of december 31 2012 we have approximately 85 billion in longterm debt obligations of which approximately 25 billion is due through january 2014 also we have approximately 8940 million in contractual obligations other than longterm debt due through december 31 2013 we expect to fund these obligations through our existing liquidity future financing arrangements and 

cash flows from operations as of december 31 2012 our liquidity was 22 billion consisting of approximately 1949 million in cash and cash equivalents and 20 billion available under our unsecured credit facilities of the 20 billion available under our unsecured credit facilities 15 billion is from revolving credit facilities and €3650 million or 05 billion based on the exchange rate at december 31 2012 is from an unsecured eurodenominated term loan facility we have the ability to draw on the €3650 million facility at any time on or prior to june 30 2013 during 2013 it is likely we will secure additional liquidity in the capital andor credit markets as part of our refinancing strategy for our upcoming 2013 and 2014 maturities in addition we may elect to fund our contractual obligations through other means if opportunities arise 

as of december 31 2012 we have on order two quantumclass ships and one oasisclass ship each of the quantumclass ships have committed unsecured bank financing arrangements which include sovereign financing guarantees the agreement for our oasisclass ship is subject to certain closing conditions and is expected to become effective in the first quarter of 2013 

we anticipate that our cash flows from operations our current available credit facilities and our current and anticipated financing arrangements will be adequate to meet our capital expenditures and debt repayments over the next twelvemonth period 

we continue our focus on ensuring adequate cash and liquidity we are focused on cost efficiency and continue to implement cost containment initiatives including a number of initiatives to reduce energy consumption and by extension fuel costs these include the design of more fuel efficient ships and the implementation of other hardware and energy efficiencies 

if i any person other than a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates and their respective affiliates the applicable group acquires ownership of more than 33 of our common stock and the applicable group owns less of our common stock than such person or ii subject to certain exceptions during any 24month period a majority of the board is no longer comprised of individuals who were members of the board on the first day of such period we may be obligated to prepay indebtedness outstanding under the majority of our credit facilities which we may be unable to replace on similar terms certain of our outstanding debt securities also contain change of control provisions that would be triggered by the acquisition of greater than 50 of our common stock by a person other than a member of the applicable group coupled with a ratings downgrade if this were to occur it would have an adverse impact on our liquidity and operations 

debt covenants 

certain of our financing agreements contain covenants that require us among other things to maintain minimum net worth of at least 56 billion a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 125x and limit our net debttocapital ratio to no more than 625 the fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated by dividing net cash from operations for the past four quarters by the sum of dividend payments plus scheduled principal debt payments in excess of any new financings for the past four quarters our minimum net worth and maximum net debttocapital calculations exclude the impact of accumulated other comprehensive loss income on total shareholders equity  we are well in excess of all debt covenant requirements as of december 31 2012 the specific covenants and related definitions can be found in the applicable debt agreements the majority of which have been previously filed with the securities and exchange commission 

dividends 

we declared and paid cash dividends on our common stock of 010 per share during each of the first and second quarters of 2012 and 012 per share during each of the third and fourth quarters of 2012 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial instruments and other 

general 

we are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices we manage these risks through a combination of our normal operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments pursuant to our hedging practices and policies the financial impact of these hedging instruments is primarily offset by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures being hedged we achieve this by closely matching the amount term and conditions of the derivative instrument with the underlying risk being hedged although certain of our derivative financial instruments do not qualify or are not accounted for under hedge accounting we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes we monitor our derivative positions using techniques including market valuations and sensitivity analyses see note 13 fair value measurements and derivative instruments to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our longterm debt obligations including future interest payments and our operating lease for brilliance of the seas  at december 31 2012 approximately 458 of our longterm debt was effectively fixed as compared to 40 as of december 31 2011 we use interest rate swap agreements to modify our exposure to interest rate movements and to manage our interest expense and rent expense 

market risk associated with our longterm fixed rate debt is the potential increase in fair value resulting from a decrease in interest rates we use interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a portion of our fixedrate debt to a floatingrate basis to manage this risk at december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 we maintained interest rate swap agreements on the 4200 million fixed rate portion of our oasis of the seas unsecured amortizing term loan the interest rate swap agreements effectively changed the interest rate on the balance of the unsecured term loan which was 3150 million as of december 31 2012 from a fixed rate of 541 to a liborbased floating rate equal to libor plus 387 currently approximately 442 these interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as fair value hedges in addition during 2012 we terminated our interest rate swap agreements that effectively changed 3500 million of debt with a fixed rate of 725 to liborbased floating rate debt in order to manage our percentage of fixed rate debt terminating the swaps did not result in a gain or loss upon termination of these swaps we received net cash proceeds of approximately 606 million a 601 million increase to the carrying value of the debt is being amortized to reduce interest expense over the remaining life of the debt 

the estimated fair value of our longterm fixed rate debt at december 31 2012 was 45 billion using quoted market prices where available or using the present value of expected future cash flows which incorporates risk profile the fair value of our fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements was estimated to be an asset of 57 million as of december 31 2012 based on the present value of expected future cash flows a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates at december 31 2012 would increase the fair value of our longterm fixed rate debt by approximately 515 million net of an increase in the fair value of the associated fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements 

market risk associated with our longterm floating rate debt is the potential increase in interest expense from an increase in interest rates we use interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a portion of our floatingrate debt to a fixedrate basis to manage this risk a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase our forecasted 2013 interest expense by 

approximately 316 million assuming no change in foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 we maintained forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements that beginning april 2013 effectively convert the interest rate on approximately 6272 million of the celebrity reflection unsecured amortizing term loan balance from libor plus 040 to a fixedrate including applicable margin of 285 through the term of the loan these interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges in addition during 2012 we entered into forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements that hedge the anticipated unsecured amortizing term loans that will finance our purchase of quantum of the seas and anthem of the seas  forwardstarting interest rate swaps hedging the quantum of the seas loan will effectively convert the interest rate for 7350 million of the anticipated loan balance from libor plus 130 to a fixed rate of 374 inclusive of margin beginning in october 2014 forwardstarting interest rate swaps hedging the anthem of the seas loan will effectively convert the interest rate for 7250 million of the anticipated loan balance from libor plus 130 to a fixed rate of 386 inclusive of margin beginning in april 2015 the fair value of our floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements was estimated to be a liability of 555 million as of december 31 2012 based on the present value of expected future cash flows 

market risk associated with our operating lease for brilliance of the seas is the potential increase in rent expense from an increase in sterling libor rates a hypothetical one percentage point increase in sterling libor rates would increase our forecasted 2013 rent expense by approximately 27 million based on the exchange rate at december 31 2012 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to our ship construction contracts denominated in euro and our growing international business operations we enter into foreign currency forward contracts collar options and cross currency swap agreements to manage portions of the exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 

the estimated fair value as of december 31 2012 of our eurodenominated forward contracts associated with our ship construction contracts was an asset of 41 million based on the present value of expected future cash flows as of december 31 2012 the aggregate cost of our ships on order was approximately 36 billion of which we had deposited 1310 million as of such date approximately 497 and 433 of the aggregate cost of the ships under construction was exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate at december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 respectively a hypothetical 10 strengthening of the euro as of december 31 2012 assuming no changes in comparative interest rates would result in a 2053 million increase in the united states dollar cost of the foreign currency denominated ship construction contracts exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate 

our growing international business operations subject us to an increasing level of foreign currency exchange risk we transact business in many different foreign currencies and maintain investments in foreign operations which may expose us to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates movements in foreign currency exchange rates may affect the translated value of our earnings and cash flows we manage most of this exposure on a consolidated basis which allows us to take advantage of any natural offsets therefore weakness in one particular currency might be offset by strengths in other currencies over time our earnings are also subject to volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the united states dollar to mitigate our foreign currency exchange rate exposure resulting from our net foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities we denominate a portion of our debt in our subsidiaries and investments functional currencies enter into foreign currency forward contracts and we have historically utilized cross currency swap agreements 

during 2012 we terminated a portion of our foreign currency forward contracts for celebrity reflection because their maturity dates were not aligned with the ships delivery date the terminated 

contracts were designated as cash flow hedges simultaneously we entered into new foreign currency forward contracts that were aligned with the ships delivery date and designated the contracts as cash flow hedges we effected the termination of the contracts by entering into offsetting foreign currency forward contracts neither the original nor the offsetting foreign currency forward contracts were designated as hedging instruments as a result subsequent changes in the fair value of the original and offsetting foreign currency forward contracts were recognized in earnings immediately and were reported within other income expense in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss we deferred a loss of 108 million within accumulated other comprehensive income loss and a gain of 17 million within property and equipment net for the terminated contracts during the fourth quarter of 2012 we began recognition of the net deferred loss of 91 million as an increase to depreciation expense over the estimated useful life of the vessel 

during 2012 we entered into foreign currency collar options to hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposure on the construction contract price for anthem of the seas  these options mature in april 2015 and have an estimated fair value of 90 million at december 31 2012 in addition to further increase the portion of our €10 billion debt that we utilize as a net investment hedge of our euro denominated investments in foreign operations we terminated our cross currency swap agreements that effectively changed €1500 million of our €10 billion unsecured senior notes which bear interest at a fixed rate of 5625 to 1909 million with a fixed rate of 668 upon termination of these swaps we received net cash proceeds of approximately 91 million and deferred a loss of 26 million within accumulated other comprehensive income loss which we will recognize within interest expense net of capitalized interest over the remaining life of the debt 

we consider our investments in our foreign operations to be denominated in relatively stable currencies and of a longterm nature we partially mitigate the exposure of our investments in foreign operations by denominating a portion of our debt in our subsidiaries and investments functional currencies and designating it as a hedge of these subsidiaries and investments we had assigned debt as a hedge of our net investments in pullmantur and tui cruises of approximately €4817 million and €6650 million or approximately 6351 million and 8632 million through december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively accordingly we have included approximately 101 million of foreigncurrency transaction losses in the foreign currency translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss at december 31 2012 a hypothetical 10 increase or decrease in the december 31 2012 euro exchange rate would increase or decrease the fair value of our assigned debt by 680 million which would be offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the united states dollar value of our net investment 

lastly on a regular basis we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than our functional currency or the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries during 2012 we maintained an average of approximately 3347 million of these foreign currency forward contracts these instruments are not designated as hedging instruments foreign currency forward contract gains of approximately 77 million are recognized in earnings within other income expense in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss this gain offset exchange losses arising from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies of 118 million in 2012 

fuel price risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates primarily to the consumption of fuel on our ships fuel cost net of the financial impact of fuel swap agreements as a percentage of our total revenues was approximately 118 in 2012 101 in 2011 and 96 in 2010 we use a range of instruments including fuel swap agreements and fuel call options to mitigate the financial impact of fluctuations in fuel prices during 2012 we terminated our remaining fuel call options by selling 

offsetting fuel call options in order to adjust the hedged percentage of our projected fuel requirements upon termination we received net cash proceeds of approximately 107 million subsequent to the termination neither the original nor the offsetting fuel call options were designated as hedging instruments and changes in their fair value were recognized in earnings immediately and were reported in other income expense in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss 

as of december 31 2012 we had fuel swap agreements to pay fixed prices for fuel with an aggregate notional amount of approximately 11 billion maturing through 2016 the fuel swap agreements represent 55 of our projected 2013 fuel requirements 45 of our projected 2014 fuel requirements 25 of our projected 2015 fuel requirements and 7 of our projected 2016 fuel requirements the estimated fair value of these contracts at december 31 2012 was estimated to be an asset of 486 million we estimate that a hypothetical 10 increase in our weightedaverage fuel price from that experienced during the year ended december 31 2012 would increase our forecasted 2013 fuel cost by approximately 358 million net of the impact of fuel swap agreements

industry 

cruising is considered a well established vacation sector in the north american market a growing sector in the european market and a developing but promising sector in several other emerging markets industry data indicates that a significant portion of cruise guests carried are firsttime cruisers we believe this presents an opportunity for longterm growth and a potential for increased profitability 

we estimate that the global cruise industry carried 202 million cruise guests in 2011 compared to 188 million cruise guests carried in 2010 we estimate that the global cruise fleet was served by approximately 417000 berths on approximately 285 ships at the end of 2011 there are approximately 20 ships with an estimated 62000 berths that are expected to be placed in service in the global cruise market between 2012 and 2016 although it is also possible that ships could be taken out of service during these periods the majority of cruise guests have historically been sourced from north america and europe 

north america 

although the north american cruise market has historically experienced significant growth the compound annual growth rate in cruise guests for this market was approximately 32 from 2007 to 2011 this more limited growth is attributable in large part to the recent international expansion within the cruise industry we estimate that north america was served by 138 ships with approximately 201000 berths at the beginning of 2007 and by 143 ships with approximately 248000 berths at the end of 2011 there are approximately 10 ships with an estimated 34000 berths that are expected to be placed in service in the north american cruise market between 2012 and 2016 

europe 

in europe cruising represents a smaller but growing sector of the vacation industry it has experienced a compound annual growth rate in cruise guests of approximately 96 from 2007 to 2011 and we believe this market has significant continued growth potential we estimate that europe was served by 104 ships with approximately 100000 berths at the beginning of 2007 and by 121 ships with approximately 155000 berths at the end of 2011 there are approximately 10 ships with an estimated 28000 berths that are expected to be placed in service in the european cruise market between 2012 and 2016 

  

the following table details the growth in the global north american and european cruise markets in terms of cruise guests and estimated weightedaverage berths over the past five years 

 

  

   other markets 

in addition to expected industry growth in north america and europe as discussed above we expect the asiapacific region to demonstrate an even higher growth rate in the near term although it will continue to represent a relatively small sector compared to north america and europe 

we compete with a number of cruise lines however our principal competitors are carnival corporation  plc which owns among others aida cruises carnival cruise lines costa cruises cunard line holland america line iberocruceros po cruises and princess cruises disney cruise line msc cruises norwegian cruise line and oceania cruises cruise lines compete with other vacation alternatives such as landbased resort hotels and sightseeing destinations for consumers’ leisure time demand for such activities is influenced by political and general economic conditions companies within the vacation market are dependent on consumer discretionary spending

insurance

we maintain war risk insurance which covers damage due to acts of war including invasion insurrection terrorism rebellion piracy and hijacking on each ship through a norwegian war risk insurance organization this coverage includes coverage for physical damage to the ship which is not covered under the hull policies as a result of war exclusion clauses in such hull policies we also maintain protection and indemnity war risk coverage for risks that would be excluded by the rules of the indemnity insurance organizations subject to certain limitations consistent with most marine war risk policies under the terms of our war risk insurance coverage underwriters can give seven days notice to us that the policy will be canceled and reinstated at higher premium rates 

insurance coverage for shoreside property shipboard inventory and general liability risks are maintained with insurance underwriters in the united states and the united kingdom 

  

we do not carry business interruption insurance for our ships based on our evaluation of the risks involved and protective measures already in place as compared to the cost of insurance we carry business interruption insurance for certain of our shoreside operations 

all insurance coverage is subject to certain limitations exclusions and deductible levels in addition in certain circumstances we either selfinsure or coinsure a portion of these risks premiums charged by insurance carriers including carriers in the maritime insurance industry increase or decrease from time to time and tend to be cyclical in nature these cycles are impacted both by our own loss experience and by losses incurred in direct and reinsurance markets we historically have been able to obtain insurance coverage in amounts and at premiums we have deemed to be commercially acceptable no assurance can be given that affordable and secure insurance markets will be available to us in the future particularly for war risk insurance 

the athens convention relating to the carriage of passengers and their luggage by sea 1974 and the 1976 protocol to the athens convention are generally applicable to passenger ships the united states has not ratified the athens convention however with limited exceptions the 1976 athens convention protocol may be contractually enforced with respect to those of our cruises that do not call at a united states port the international maritime organization diplomatic conference agreed upon a new protocol to the athens convention on november 1 2002 the 2002 protocol which is not yet in force pending ratification by the requisite number of countries substantially increases the level of compulsory insurance which must be maintained by passenger ship operators in an attempt to expedite implementation the european union adopted the european union regulation 3922009 “eu passenger liability regulation” on the liability of carriers of passengers by sea which will become effective on december 31 2012 this regulation incorporates the 2002 protocol in many ways we have had discussions with the insurance marketplace and feel that we have sufficient coverage to meet the level of coverage required under the eu passenger liability regulation

we own a number of registered trademarks related to the royal caribbean international celebrity cruises azamara club cruises pullmantur and cdf croisières de france cruise brands the registered trademarks include the name “royal caribbean international” and its crown and anchor logo the name “celebrity cruises” and its “x” logo the name “azamara club cruises” and its logo the names “pullmantur cruises” and “pullmantur” and their logos the name “cdf croisières de france” and its logo and the names of various cruise ships we believe our trademarks are widely recognized throughout the world and have considerable value 

regulation 

our ships are regulated by various international national state and local laws regulations and treaties in force in the jurisdictions in which they operate in addition our ships are registered in the bahamas malta or in the case of celebrity xpedition  ecuador each ship is subject to regulations issued by its country of registry including regulations issued pursuant to international treaties governing the safety of our ships guests and crew as well as environmental protection each country of registry conducts periodic inspections to verify compliance with these regulations as discussed more fully below ships operating out of united states ports are subject to inspection by the united states coast guard for compliance with international treaties and by the united states public health service for sanitary conditions our ships are also subject to similar inspections pursuant to the laws and regulations of various other countries our ships visit 

we believe that we are in material compliance with all the regulations applicable to our ships and that we have all licenses necessary to conduct our business health safety security environmental and financial responsibility issues are and we believe will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant government authorities in the united states and internationally from time to time various regulatory and legislative changes may be proposed that could impact our operations and subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 

safety and security regulations 

our ships are required to comply with international safety standards defined in the international convention for safety of life at sea “solas” which among other things establishes requirements for ship design structural features 

  

materials construction life saving equipment and safe management and operation of ships to ensure guest and crew safety the solas standards are revised from time to time and the most recent modifications were phased in through 2010 compliance with these modified standards did not a have a material effect on our operating costs solas incorporates the international safety management code “ism code” which provides an international standard for the safe management and operation of ships and for pollution prevention the ism code is mandatory for passenger vessel operators all of our operations and ships are regularly audited by national authorities and maintain the required certificates of compliance with the ism code 

our ships are subject to various security requirements including the international ship and port facility security code “isps code” which is part of solas and the us maritime transportation security act of 2002 “mtsa” which applies to ships that operate in us ports in order to satisfy these security requirements we implement security measures conduct vessel security assessments and develop security plans the security plans for all of our ships have been submitted to and approved by the respective countries of registry for our ships in compliance with the isps code and the mtsa 

in july 2010 the us adopted the cruise vessel security and safety act of 2010 which applies to passenger vessels which embark or include port stops within the united states this act requires the implementation of certain safety design features as well the establishment of practices for the reporting of and dealing with allegations of crime in 2012 the us coast guard is expected to issue regulations governing implementation of certain provisions of the act we already exceed most of the requirements of the act and do not expect any costs that would be material to us to be required due to these likely regulations 

environmental regulations 

we are subject to various united states and international laws and regulations relating to environmental protection under such laws and regulations we are prohibited from among other things discharging certain materials such as petrochemicals and plastics into the waterways we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations from time to time environmental and other regulators consider more stringent regulations which may affect our operations and increase our compliance costs we believe that the impact of ships on the global environment will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world and accordingly will likely subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 

our ships are subject to the international maritime organization’s “imo” regulations under the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships the “marpol regulations” which includes requirements designed to prevent and minimize pollution by oil sewage garbage and air emissions we have obtained the relevant international compliance certificates relating to oil sewage and air pollution prevention for all of our ships 

on january 1 2010 a european union directive regarding the use of low sulfur fuels for ships became effective the directive places a 01 sulfur content limit on all marine fuels used by such ships while berthed or anchored in european union ports compliance with this directive requires us to use distillate fuels such as marine gas oil this has not had a material effect on our fuel and operating costs 

the marpol regulations impose global limitations on the sulfur content of fuel used by ships operating worldwide permitted sulfur content was reduced from 45 to 35 on january 1 2012 we do not expect that this required reduction will have a material effect on our fuel and operating costs these regulations will also require the worldwide limitations on sulfur content of fuel to be reduced to 05 by january 1 2020 subject to a feasibility review to be completed by imo no later than 2018 if such a reduced limitation is implemented worldwide in 2020 our fuel costs could increase significantly 

in addition to the global limitations the marpol regulations establish special emission control areas “ecas” with stringent limitations on sulfur and nitrogen oxide emissions in these areas as of july 1 2010 ships operating in designated ecas were required to reduce their fuel sulfur content from 15 to 10 under these regulations ships operating in ecas will be required to further reduce their fuel sulfur content to 01 beginning on january 1 2015 

as of the date of this report both the baltic sea and the north seaenglish channel have been established as ecas during 2010 the imo accepted and adopted the application by the united states france and canada to designate as an 

  

eca waters within 200 nautical miles of their east west and gulf coasts as applicable as well as the hawaiian islands but excluding certain areas within the caribbean basin such as the bahamas the canadian arctic western alaska and the aleutian islands this designation will be effective as of august 1 2012 in addition in july 2011 the imo accepted and adopted the application by the united states to designate the waters surrounding puerto rico and the us virgin islands as an eca this designation will be effective as of january 2014 

as of the date hereof the required sulfur content reductions in the existing ecas has not had a material impact on our operations and we do not expect the initial required sulfur content reductions in either the united states french and canadian eca or the puerto ricous virgin islands eca will have a material effect on our fuel and operating costs however the additional reduction to 01 as of january 1 2015 could significantly increase our costs after this date based on current capacities fuel prices itineraries and technologies the cost impact from implementing progressively lower sulfur content requirements after january 1 2015 is not reasonably determinable given the length of time until such possible implementation and the applicability of many possible mitigating factors such as changes in the future supply and demand for fuel the development of emissions abatement technologies including new engine designs or exhaust gas treatment systems the acceptance of alternative compliance methods the cost migration effects of equivalent compliance initiatives and new fuel conservation initiatives 

in july 2011 new marpol regulations introduced mandatory measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions these include the utilization of an energy efficiency design index eedi for new ships as well as the establishment of an energy efficient management plan for all ships the eedi is a performancebased mechanism that requires a certain minimum energy efficiency in new ships these regulations will be effective as of january 1 2013 we do not anticipate that compliance with these regulations will have a material effect on our operating costs 

we are required to obtain certificates from the united states coast guard relating to our ability to satisfy liability in cases of water pollution pursuant to united states coast guard regulations we arrange through our insurers for the provision of guarantees aggregating 3477 million as a condition to obtaining the required certificates the cost of obtaining these guarantees does not have a material effect on our operating costs 

labor regulations 

the international labour organization an agency of the united nations that develops worldwide employment standards has adopted a new consolidated maritime labour convention the “convention” the convention which will be effective one year following ratification by at least 30 countries representing at least 33 of the world gross tonnage reflects a broad range of standards and conditions to govern all aspects of crew management for ships in international commerce including additional requirements not previously in effect relating to the health safety repatriation entitlements and status of crewmembers and crew recruitment practices the convention is expected to be ratified during 2012 in which case it would become effective in 2013 our expenses will likely increase following its effectiveness however the amount of the increase is not reasonably determinable pending the enactment of legislation to implement new standards outlined in the convention by the enacting countries 

consumer financial responsibility regulations 

we are required to obtain certificates from the united states federal maritime commission relating to our ability to satisfy liability in cases of nonperformance of obligations to guests as well as casualty and personal injury pursuant to the united states federal maritime commission regulations we arrange through our insurers for the provision of guarantees in the amount of 150 million for each of our two us shipoperating companies royal caribbean cruises ltd and celebrity cruises inc and a bond in the amount of 150 million for one of our uk ship operating companies as a condition to obtaining the required certificates in september 2011 the united states federal maritime commission published a proposed rule that would increase the required guarantees to 300 million per operator 900 million in the aggregate subject to consumer price index based adjustments every two years this increase if adopted will be phased in over a twoyear period the fmc is expected to vote on final passage of the proposed rule in early to mid 2012 we do not anticipate that compliance with the new rule will have a material effect on our costs 

we are also required by the united kingdom norway finland and the baltics to establish our financial responsibility for any liability resulting from the nonperformance of our obligations to guests from these jurisdictions in the united 

  

kingdom we are currently required by the association of british travel agents to provide performance bonds totaling approximately £304 million the norwegian travel guarantee fund currently requires us to maintain performance bonds of approximately 272 million to cover our financial responsibility in norway finland and the baltics we are also required to pay to the united kingdom civil aviation authority a nonrefundable levy of £250 per guest where we arrange a flight as part of the cruise vacation 

certain other jurisdictions also require that we establish financial responsibility to our guests resulting from the nonperformance of our obligations however the related amounts do not have a material effect on our costs 

regulations regarding protection of disabled persons 

in 2010 the united states department of transportation issued regulations the “new ada regulations” addressing various issues applicable to passenger vessels under the american with disabilities act the “ada” part i of the new ada regulations which include required reservation policies for disabled guests and requirements for aids and services to disabled passengers became effective in january 2011 we are in compliance with part i of the new ada regulations and did not need to make any material expenditures to comply part ii when issued is expected to address physical accessibility standards while we believe our vessels have been designed and outfitted to meet the needs of our disabled guests we cannot at this time accurately predict whether we will be required to make material modifications or incur significant additional expenses in response to part ii of the new ada regulations 

taxation of the company 

the following is a summary of our principal taxes exemptions and special regimes in addition to or instead of income taxation virtually all jurisdictions where our ships call impose some tax or fee or both based on guest headcount tonnage or some other measure 

we are primarily foreign corporations engaged in the business of operating passenger cruise ships in international transportation we also own and operate other businesses primarily consisting of the landtour operation in alaska and the pullmantur landtour and air business 

united states income taxation 

the following is a discussion of the application of the united states federal and state income tax laws to us and is based on the current provisions of the united states internal revenue code treasury department regulations administrative rulings court decisions and the relevant state tax laws regulations rulings and court decisions of the states where we have business operations all of the foregoing is subject to change and any such change could affect the accuracy of this discussion 

application of section 883 of the internal revenue code 

we and celebrity cruises inc and many of our shipowning subsidiaries are engaged in a trade or business in the united states and in many cases depending upon the itineraries of the ships receive income from sources within the united states additionally our united kingdom tonnage tax company owned by us and celebrity cruises inc is a shipoperating company that may earn united states source income and is a company for which an election was filed to be classified as a partnership for united states federal income tax purposes under section 883 of the internal revenue code certain foreign corporations are not subject to united states federal income or branch profits tax on united states source income derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships including income from the leasing of such ships 

a foreign corporation will qualify for the benefits of section 883 if in relevant part 1 the foreign country in which the foreign corporation is organized grants an equivalent exemption to corporations organized in the united states and 2 the stock of the corporation or the direct or indirect corporate parent thereof is “primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market” in the united states or another qualifying country such as norway in the opinion of our united states tax counsel drinker biddle  reath llp based on the representations and assumptions set forth in that opinion we celebrity cruises inc and our shipowning subsidiaries qualify for the benefits of section 883 because we 

  

and each of those subsidiaries are incorporated in liberia or malta which are qualifying countries and our common stock is primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market in the united states or norway if in the future 1 liberia or malta no longer qualifies as an equivalent exemption jurisdiction and we do not reincorporate in a jurisdiction that does qualify for the exemption or 2 we fail to qualify as a publicly traded corporation we and all of our shipowning or operating subsidiaries that rely on section 883 for tax exemption on qualifying income would be subject to united states federal income tax on their united states source shipping income and income from activities incidental thereto 

we believe that most of our income and the income of our shipowning subsidiaries is derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships and therefore is exempt from taxation under section 883 additionally income earned through a partnership will qualify as income derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships to the same extent as the income would so qualify if earned directly by the partners thus we believe that united states source income derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships earned by the united kingdom tonnage tax company will qualify for exemption under section 883 to the same extent as if it were earned directly by the owners of the united kingdom tonnage tax company 

regulations under section 883 list activities that are not considered by the internal revenue service to be incidental to the international operation of ships including income from the sale of air and land transportation shore excursions and pre and postcruise tours to the extent the income from these activities is earned from sources within the united states that income will be subject to united states taxation 

taxation in the absence of an exemption under section 883 of the internal revenue code 

if we celebrity cruises inc or our shipowning subsidiaries were to fail to meet the requirements of section 883 of the internal revenue code or if the provision was repealed then as explained below such companies would be subject to united states income taxation on a portion of their income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships 

because we and celebrity cruises inc conduct a trade or business in the united states we and celebrity cruises inc would be taxable at regular corporate rates on our separate company taxable income ie without regard to the income of our shipowning subsidiaries from united states sources in addition if any of our earnings and profits effectively connected with our united states trade or business were withdrawn or were deemed to have been withdrawn from our united states trade or business those withdrawn amounts would be subject to a “branch profits” tax at the rate of 30 we and celebrity cruises inc would also be potentially subject to tax on portions of certain interest paid by us at rates of up to 30 

if section 883 were not available to our shipowning subsidiaries each such subsidiary would be subject to a special 4 tax on its united states source gross transportation income if any each year because it does not have a fixed place of business in the united states and its income is derived from the leasing of a ship 

other united states taxation 

our primary domestic united states operation the alaska landtour operation is subject to united states federal income tax additionally we and celebrity cruises inc earn united states source income from activities not considered incidental to international shipping the tax on such income is not material to our results of operation for all years presented 

state taxation 

we celebrity cruises inc and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various united states state income taxes which are generally imposed on each state’s portion of the united states source income subject to federal income taxes additionally the state of alaska subjects an allocated portion of the total income of companies doing business in alaska and certain other affiliated companies to alaska corporate state income taxes and also imposes a 33 tax on adjusted gross income from onboard gambling activities conducted in alaska waters this did not have a material impact to our results of operations for all years presented 

  

maltese spanish and french income tax 

our pullmantur ship owneroperator subsidiaries which include the owneroperator of cdf croisieres de france’s ship qualify as licensed shipping organizations in malta no maltese income tax is charged on the income derived from shipping activities of a licensed shipping organization instead a licensed shipping organization is liable to pay a tonnage tax based on the net tonnage of the ship or ships registered under the relevant provisions of the merchant shipping act a company qualifies as a shipping organization if it engages in qualifying activities and it obtains a license from the registrargeneral to enable it to carry on such activities qualifying activities include but are not limited to the ownership operation under charter or otherwise administration and management of a ship or ships registered as a maltese ship in terms of the merchant shipping act and the carrying on of all ancillary financial security and commercial activities in connection therewith 

our maltese operations that do not qualify as licensed shipping organizations which are not considered significant remain subject to normal maltese corporate income tax 

pullmantur has sales and marketing functions landbased tour operations and air business in spain these activities are subject to spanish taxation the tax from these operations is not considered significant to our operations cdf croisieres de france’s french operations are minimal and therefore its french income taxes are minimal 

united kingdom income tax 

we operate thirteen ships under companies which have elected to be subject to the united kingdom tonnage tax regime “uk tonnage tax” 

companies subject to uk tonnage tax pay a corporate tax on a notional profit determined with reference to the net tonnage of qualifying vessels normal united kingdom corporate income tax is not chargeable on the relevant shipping profits of a qualifying uk tonnage tax company the requirements for a company to qualify for the uk tonnage tax regime include being subject to united kingdom corporate income tax operating qualifying ships which are strategically and commercially managed in the united kingdom and fulfilling a seafarer training requirement failure to meet any of these requirements could cause us to lose the benefit of the tonnage tax regime which will have a material effect on our results of operations 

relevant shipping profits include income from the operation of qualifying ships and from shipping related activities our united kingdom income from nonshipping activities which do not qualify under the uk tonnage tax regime and which are not considered significant remain subject to united kingdom corporate income tax 

brazilian income tax 

pullmantur and our uk tonnage tax company charters certain ships to brazilian companies for operations in brazil from november to may some of these charters are with unrelated third parties and others are with a brazilian affiliate the brazilian affiliate’s earnings are subject to brazilian taxation which is not considered significant we believe the charter payments made to the uk tonnage tax company and to pullmantur are exempt from brazilian income tax under brazilian domestic law 

other taxation 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to income tax in other jurisdictions on income that does not qualify for exemption or tonnage tax regimes the tax on such income was not material to our results of operations for all years presented our uk tonnage tax company is exempt from some taxation in certain jurisdictions where those companies have business operations under relevant united kingdom tax treaties

 item 1a risk factors 

the risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k are important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historical results it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks the risks described below are only those known risks relating to our operations and financial condition that we consider material there may be additional risks that we consider not to be material or which are not known and any of these risks could have the effects set forth below   see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a cautionary note regarding forwardlooking statements 

adverse worldwide economic geopolitical or other conditions could reduce the demand for cruises and adversely impact our operating results cash flows and financial condition including potentially impairing the value of our ships goodwill and other assets 

the demand for cruises is affected by international national and local economic and geopolitical conditions the recent severe economic downturn coupled with continued uncertainty as to the future global economic landscape has had and continues to have an adverse effect on vacationers’ discretionary income and consumer confidence this in turn has resulted in cruise booking slowdowns decreased cruise prices and lower onboard revenues for us and for the others in the cruise industry as compared to more robust economic times although the cruise industry continued to recover in 2011 recovery has been slow and has been hindered by the ongoing economic instability including heightened concerns regarding european economies in addition certain countries have been more severely impacted by the recent economic downturn than other economies around the world where we do business including for example spain where we operate our pullmantur brand we cannot predict with any certainty whether demand for cruises will continue to improve or the rate of such improvement stagnant or worsening global economic conditions could result in a prolonged period of booking slowdowns depressed cruise prices and reduced onboard revenues 

demand for our cruises is also influenced by geopolitical events in the markets in which we operate unfavorable conditions such as civil unrest and governmental changes especially in regions with popular ports of call can undermine consumer demand andor pricing for itineraries featuring these ports for example the ongoing political instability in the eastern mediterranean and northern africa and its spillover effects in surrounding areas negatively impacted our results of operations in 2011 continued unrest and economic instability in this or other regions we do business could materially adversely impact our operating results cash flows and financial condition including potentially impairing the value of our ships goodwill and other assets 

we may not be able to obtain sufficient financing or capital for our needs or may not be able to do so on terms that are acceptable or consistent with our expectations 

to fund our capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments we have historically relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations drawdowns under available credit facilities the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the sale of equity or debt securities in private or public securities markets the decrease in consumer cruise spending as a result of the recent severe economic downturn had an adverse impact on our cash flows from operations and if the current economic conditions worsen our operational cash flows could continue to be negatively affected see “— adverse worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions could reduce the demand for cruises and adversely impact our operating results cash flows and financial condition ” 

  

although we believe we have or can access sufficient liquidity to fund our operations and obligations as expected there can be no assurances to that effect our ability to timely refinance andor replace our outstanding debt securities and credit facilities on acceptable terms our cost of funding and our ability to access additional funding as may be needed will depend upon numerous factors including but not limited to the vibrancy of the financial markets our financial performance and credit ratings and the performance of our industry in general 

our inability to satisfy the covenants required by our credit facilities could adversely impact our liquidity 

our debt agreements contain covenants including covenants restricting our ability to take certain actions and financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum net worth and fixed charge coverage ratios and limit our net debttocapital ratio our ability to comply with the terms of our outstanding facilities may be affected by general economic conditions industry conditions and other events some of which may be beyond our control in addition our ability to make draws under our revolving credit facilities is subject to the absence of material adverse changes in our business our ability to maintain our credit facilities may also be impacted by changes in our ownership base more specifically we may be required to prepay a majority of our debt facilities if i any person other than a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates and their respective affiliates the “applicable group” acquires ownership of more than 30 of our common stock and the applicable group owns less of our common stock than such person or ii subject to certain exceptions during any 24month period a majority of the board is no longer comprised of individuals who were members of the board on the first day of such period certain of our outstanding debt securities also contain change of control provisions that would be triggered by the acquisition of greater than 50 of our common stock by a person other than a member of the applicable group coupled with a ratings downgrade 

our failure to comply with the terms of our debt facilities could result in an event of default generally if an event of default under any debt agreement occurs then pursuant to cross default acceleration clauses our outstanding debt and derivative contract payables could become due andor terminated we cannot provide assurances that we would have sufficient liquidity to repay or refinance the borrowings under any of the credit facilities or settle other outstanding contracts if such amounts were accelerated upon an event of default 

in addition under several of our agreements with credit card processors that accept credit cards for the sale of cruises and other services the credit card processor may hold back a reserve from our credit card receivables following the occurrence of certain events including a default under our major credit facilities as of december 31 2011 we were not required to maintain any reserve under such agreements 

incidents or adverse publicity concerning the cruise vacation industry unusual weather conditions and other natural disasters or disruptions could affect our reputation as well as impact our sales and results of operations 

the operation of cruise ships airplanes land tours port facilities and shore excursions involves the risk of accidents illnesses environmental incidents and other incidents which may bring into question guest safety health security and vacation satisfaction which could negatively impact our reputation incidents involving cruise ships and in particular the safety and security of guests and crew such as the recent grounding of the costa concordia media coverage thereof as well as adverse media publicity concerning the cruise vacation industry or unusual weather patterns or natural disasters or disruptions such as hurricanes and earthquakes and the collateral impact thereof could impact demand for our cruises the considerable expansion in the use of social media over recent years has compounded the potential scope of the negative publicity that could be generated by those incidents if any such incident occurs in a region during a time of high seasonal demand the effect could disproportionately impact our results of operations for the year in addition any events which impact the travel industry more generally may negatively impact our ability to deliver guests to our cruises andor interrupt our ability to obtain services and goods from key vendors in our supply chain any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and on industry performance 

the impact of disruptions in the global financial markets may affect the ability of our counterparties and others to perform their obligations to us 

the recent severe economic downturn including failures of financial service companies and the related liquidity crisis disrupted the capital and credit markets and additional economic concerns from some of the countries in the european 

  

union continue to strain the financial markets both in the us and internationally a recurrence of these disruptions could cause our counterparties and others to breach their obligations to us under our contracts with them this could include failures of banks or other financial service companies to fund required borrowings under our loan agreements or to pay us amounts that may become due under our derivative contracts for hedging of fuel prices interest rates and foreign currencies or other agreements if any of the foregoing occurs it may have a negative impact on our cash flows including our ability to meet our obligations results of operations and financial condition 

an increase in capacity worldwide or excess capacity in a particular market could adversely impact our cruise sales andor pricing 

although our ships can be redeployed cruise sales andor pricing may be impacted both by the introduction of new ships into the marketplace and by deployment decisions of ourselves and our competitors a total of 20 new ships with approximately 62000 berths are on order for delivery through 2016 in the cruise industry the further growth in capacity from these new ships and future orders without an increase in the cruise industry’s share of the vacation market could depress cruise prices and impede our ability to achieve yield improvement in addition to the extent that we or our competitors deploy ships to a particular itinerary and the resulting capacity in that region exceeds the demand we may lower pricing and profitability may be lower than anticipated any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition including potentially impairing the value of our ships goodwill and other assets 

if we are unable to appropriately balance our cost management strategy with our goal of satisfying guest expectations it may adversely impact our business success 

our goals are to provide high quality products and deliver high quality services there can be no assurances that we can successfully balance these goals with our cost containment efforts 

we may lose business to competitors throughout the vacation market  

we operate in the vacation market and cruising is one of many alternatives for people choosing a vacation we therefore risk losing business not only to other cruise lines but also to other vacation operators which provide other leisure options including hotels resorts and package holidays and tours 

we face significant competition from other cruise lines on the basis of cruise pricing travel agent preference and also in terms of the nature of ships and services we offer to guests our principal competitors within the cruise vacation industry include carnival corporation  plc which owns among others aida cruises carnival cruise lines costa cruises cunard line holland america line iberocruceros po cruises and princess cruises disney cruise line msc cruises norwegian cruise line and oceania cruises 

in the event that we do not compete effectively with other vacation alternatives and cruise companies our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

fears of terrorist and pirate attacks war and other hostilities and the spread of contagious diseases could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

events such as terrorist and pirate attacks war and other hostilities and the resulting political instability travel restrictions the spread of contagious diseases and concerns over safety health and security aspects of traveling or the fear of any of the foregoing have had and could have in the future a significant adverse impact on demand and pricing in the travel and vacation industry as we continue to expand internationally we become susceptible to a wider range of adverse events these events could also impact our ability to source qualified crew from throughout the world at competitive costs and therefore increase our shipboard employee costs 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our financial results 

we earn revenues pay expenses recognize assets and incur liabilities in currencies other than the us dollar including among others the euro the british pound sterling the canadian dollar the australia dollar and the brazilian 

  

real in 2011 we derived approximately 49 of revenues from operations outside the united states because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must convert revenues income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore absent offsetting changes in other foreign currencies increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against other major currencies will affect our revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies we use derivative financial instruments to mitigate our net exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations however there can be no assurances that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly the strengthening of the us dollar against major currencies would not materially affect our financial results 

in addition we have ship construction contracts which are denominated in euros while we have entered into eurodenominated forward contracts to manage a portion of the currency risk associated with these ship construction contracts we are exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate for the portion of the ship construction contracts that has not been hedged additionally if the shipyard is unable to perform under the related ship construction contract any foreign currency hedges that were entered into to manage the currency risk would need to be terminated termination of these contracts could result in a significant loss 

environmental labor health and safety financial responsibility and other maritime regulations could affect operations and increase operating costs 

the united states and various state and foreign government or regulatory agencies have enacted or are considering new environmental regulations or policies such as requiring the use of low sulfur fuels increasing fuel efficiency requirements further restricting emissions or other initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions that could increase our cost for fuel cause us to incur significant expenses to purchase andor develop new equipment and adversely impact the cruise vacation industry see “item 1 business—regulation—environmental regulations” an increase in fuel prices not only impacts our fuel costs but also some of our other expenses such as crew travel freight and commodity prices although not all initiatives are likely to be implemented it is apparent that some future legislation and regulations related to the environment will impact the cruise industry and could adversely impact our costs some environmental groups have also lobbied for more stringent regulation of cruise ships and have generated negative publicity about the cruise vacation industry and its environmental impact 

with regards to labor we anticipate that the new standards set forth in the maritime labour convention when ratified and effective which we currently believe may occur in 2012 and 2013 respectively will likely result in increased costs associated with our onboard employees see “item 1 business—regulation—labor regulations” while we have been actively seeking ways to mitigate the potential impact on our business there can be no assurances that our efforts will be successful or that our financial results of operations will not be materially impacted 

in addition we are subject to various international national state and local laws regulations and treaties that govern among other things safety standards applicable to our ships treatment of disabled persons health and sanitary standards applicable to our guests security standards on board our ships and at the shipport interface areas and financial responsibilities to our guests these issues are and we believe will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world especially in light of the recent grounding of the costa concordia this could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise ships that would subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 

conducting business globally may result in increased costs and other risks 

we operate our business globally and plan to continue to develop our international presence operating internationally exposes us to a number of risks including unstable local economic conditions volatile local political conditions potential increases in duties and taxes required compliance with additional laws and policies affecting cruising vacation or maritime businesses or governing the operations of foreignbased companies currency fluctuations interest rate movements difficulties in operating under local business environments us and global antibribery laws or regulations imposition of trade barriers and restrictions on repatriation of earnings in addition if a country where we have significant operations or obligations leaves the euro currency system our financial condition may be adversely impacted if we are unable to address these risks adequately our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected including potentially impairing the value of our ships goodwill and other assets 

  

operating globally also exposes us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements in many parts of the world including countries in which we operate practices in the local business communities might not conform to international business standards we may not be successful in ensuring that our employees and other representatives stationed throughout the world properly adhere to our policies or applicable laws or regulations failure to adhere to our policies or applicable laws or regulations could result in penalties sanctions damage to our reputation and related costs which in turn could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flow 

our attempts to expand our business into new markets may not be successful 

while our historical focus has been to serve the north american cruise market we have expanded our focus to increase our international guest sourcing most recently in the brazilian asian and australian markets expansion into new markets requires significant levels of investment there can be no assurance that these markets will develop as anticipated or that we will have success in these markets and if we do not we may be unable to recover our investment which could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

ship construction repair or refurbishment delays or mechanical faults may result in cancellation of cruises or unscheduled drydocks and repairs and thus adversely affect our results of operations 

we depend on shipyards to construct repair and refurbish our cruise ships on a timely basis and in good working order the sophisticated nature of building a ship involves risks delays or mechanical faults in ship construction or refurbishment have in the past and may in the future result in delays or cancellation of cruises or necessitate unscheduled drydocks and repairs of ships these events and any related adverse publicity could result in lost revenue increased operating expenses or both and thus adversely affect our results of operations 

shipyards and their subcontractors may experience financial difficulties which could cause or result in delay ship cancellations or increases in shipbuilding costs that could adversely affect our results of operations 

we rely on shipyards to construct repair and refurbish our vessels financial difficulties liquidations or closures suffered by these shipyards andor their subcontractors may impact the timely delivery or costs of new ships or the ability of shipyards to repair and refurbish our existing fleet in accordance with our needs or expectations delivery delays and cancelled deliveries can adversely affect our results of operations as can any constraints on our ability to repair and maintain our ships on a timely basis 

our operating costs especially fuel expenditures could increase due to market forces and economic or geo political factors beyond our control 

expenditures for fuel represent a significant cost of operating our business if fuel prices rise significantly in a short period of time we may be unable to increase fares or other fees sufficiently to offset fully our increased fuel costs we routinely hedge a portion of our future fuel requirements to protect against rising fuel costs however there can be no assurance that our hedge contracts will provide a sufficient level of protection against increased fuel costs or that our counterparties will be able to perform under our hedge contracts such as in the case of a counterparty’s bankruptcy further volatility in fuel prices or disruptions in fuel supplies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

our other operating costs including food payroll airfare for our shipboard personnel taxes insurance and security costs are all subject to increases due to market forces and economic or political conditions or other factors beyond our control increases in these operating costs could adversely affect our profitability 

unavailability of ports of call may adversely affect our results of operations  

we believe that port destinations are a major reason why guests choose to go on a particular cruise or on a cruise vacation the availability of ports is affected by a number of factors including but not limited to existing capacity constraints security concerns adverse weather conditions and natural disasters financial limitations on port development exclusivity arrangements that ports may have with our competitors local governmental regulations and local community 

  

concerns about port development and other adverse impacts on their communities from additional tourists any limitations on the availability of our ports of call or on the availability of shore excursion and other service providers at such ports could adversely affect our results of operations 

price increases for commercial airline service for our guests or major changes or reduction in commercial airline service could adversely impact the demand for cruises and undermine our ability to provide reasonably priced vacation packages to our guests 

many of our guests depend on scheduled commercial airline services to transport them to or from the ports where our cruises embark or disembark increases in the price of airfare would increase the overall price of the cruise vacation to our guests which may adversely impact demand for our cruises in addition changes in the availability of commercial airline services could adversely affect our guests’ ability to obtain airfare as well as our ability to fly our guests to or from our cruise ships which could adversely affect our results of operations 

our reliance on travel agencies to sell and market our cruises exposes us to certain risks which if realized could adversely impact our business 

because we rely on travel agencies to generate the majority of bookings for our ships we must ensure that our commission rates and incentive structures remain competitive if we fail to offer competitive compensation packages these agencies may be incentivized to sell cruises offered by our competitors to our detriment which could adversely impact our operating results in addition the travel agent industry is sensitive to economic conditions that impact discretionary income significant disruptions especially disruptions impacting those agencies that sell a high volume of our business or contractions in the industry could reduce the number of travel agencies available for us to market and sell our cruises which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

a disruption in our shoreside operations or our information systems may adversely affect our results of operations 

our principal executive office and principal shoreside operations are located at the port of miami florida and we have call centers for reservations throughout the world although we have developed disaster recovery and similar contingency plans actual or threatened natural disasters eg hurricanes earthquakes tornados fires floods or similar events in these locations may have a material impact on our business continuity reputation and results of operations in addition substantial or repeated information systems failures computer viruses cyberattacks impacting our shoreside or shipboard operations could adversely impact our business we do not carry business interruption insurance for the majority of our shoreside operations or our information systems as such any losses or damages incurred by us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

failure to develop the value of our brands and differentiate our products could adversely affect our results of operations 

our success depends on the strength and continued development of our cruise brands and on the effectiveness of our brand strategies failure to protect and differentiate our brands from competitors throughout the vacation market could adversely affect our results of operations 

the loss of key personnel our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel or disruptions among our shipboard personnel due to strained employee relations could adversely affect our results of operations 

our success depends in large part on the skills and contributions of key executives and other employees and on our ability to recruit and retain high quality employees we must continue to recruit retain and motivate management and other employees sufficient to maintain our current business and support our projected growth furthermore as of december 31 2011 80 of our shipboard employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements a dispute under our collective bargaining agreements could result in a work stoppage of those employees covered by the agreements a loss of key employees or disruptions among our shipboard personnel could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

business activities that involve our coinvestment with third parties may subject us to additional risks 

partnerships joint ventures and other business structures involving our coinvestment with third parties such as our joint venture to operate tui cruises generally include some form of shared control over the operations of the business and create additional risks including the possibility that other investors in such ventures could become bankrupt or otherwise lack the financial resources to meet their obligations or could have or develop business interests policies or objectives that are inconsistent with ours in addition actions by another investor may present additional risks of operational difficulties 

a failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair our operations or competitive position 

our business continues to demand the use of sophisticated technology and systems these technologies and systems must be refined updated andor replaced with more advanced systems on a regular basis if we are unable to do so on a timely basis or within reasonable cost parameters our business could suffer we also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new technology or system and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could impair our operating results 

a change in our tax status under the united states internal revenue code or other jurisdictions may have adverse effects on our income  

we and a number of our subsidiaries are foreign corporations that derive income from a united states trade or business andor from sources within the united states drinker biddle  reath llp our united states tax counsel has delivered to us an opinion based on certain representations and assumptions set forth in it to the effect that this income to the extent derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships is exempt from united states federal income tax pursuant to section 883 of the internal revenue code we believe that most of our income including that of our subsidiaries is derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships 

the provisions of section 883 are subject to change at any time by legislation moreover changes could occur in the future with respect to the identity residence or holdings of our direct or indirect shareholders trading volume or trading frequency of our shares or relevant foreign tax laws of liberia or malta such that they no longer qualify as equivalent exemption jurisdictions that could affect our eligibility for the section 883 exemption accordingly there can be no assurance that we will continue to be exempt from united states income tax on united states source shipping income in the future if we were not entitled to the benefit of section 883 we and our subsidiaries would be subject to united states taxation on a portion of the income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships which would reduce our net income 

additionally portions of our business are operated by companies that are within tonnage tax regimes of the uk and malta further some of the operations of these companies are conducted in jurisdictions where we rely on tax treaties to provide exemption from taxation to the extent the tonnage tax laws of these countries change or we do not continue to meet the applicable qualification requirements or if tax treaties are changed or revoked we may be required to pay higher income tax in these jurisdictions resulting in lower net income 

as budgetary constraints continue to adversely impact the jurisdictions in which we operate increases in income tax regulations or tax reform affecting our operations may be imposed 

we are not a united states corporation and our shareholders may be subject to the uncertainties of a foreign legal system in protecting their interests 

our corporate affairs are governed by our articles of incorporation and bylaws and by the business corporation act of liberia the provisions of the business corporation act of liberia resemble provisions of the corporation laws of a number of states in the united states however while most states have a fairly well developed body of case law interpreting their respective corporate statutes there are very few judicial cases in liberia interpreting the business corporation act of liberia as such the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under liberian law are not as clearly established as the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in certain united states jurisdictions for example the right of shareholders to bring a derivative action in liberian courts 

  

may be more limited than in united states jurisdictions there may also be practical difficulties for shareholders attempting to bring suit in liberia and liberian courts may or may not recognize and enforce foreign judgments thus our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests with respect to actions by management directors or controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a united states jurisdiction 

litigation enforcement actions fines or penalties could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations andor damage our reputation 

our business is subject to various united states and international laws and regulations that could lead to enforcement actions fines civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims and damages in addition improper conduct by our employees or agents could damage our reputation andor lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties including substantial monetary fines in certain circumstances it may not be economical to defend against such matters andor a legal strategy may not ultimately result in us prevailing in a matter such events could lead to an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

provisions of our articles of incorporation bylaws and liberian law could inhibit others from acquiring us prevent a change of control and may prevent efforts by our shareholders to change our management 

certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and liberian law may inhibit third parties from effectuating a change of control of the company without board approval which could result in the entrenchment of current management these include provisions in our articles of incorporation that prevent third parties other than a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates from acquiring beneficial ownership of more than 49 of our outstanding shares without the consent of our board of directors

 item 3 legal proceedings 

between august 1 2011 and september 8 2011 three similar purported class action lawsuits were filed against us and certain of our officers in the us district court of the southern district of florida the cases have since been consolidated and a consolidated amended complaint was filed on february 17 2012 the consolidated amended complaint was filed on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of our common stock during the period from october 26 2010 through july 27 2011 and names the company our chairman and ceo our cfo and the presidents and ceos of our royal caribbean international and celebrity cruises brands as defendants the consolidated amended complaint alleges violations of section 10b of the securities exchange act of 1934 and sec rule 10b5 as well as in the case of the individual defendants the control person provisions of the securities exchange act the complaint principally alleges that the defendants knowingly made incorrect statements concerning the company’s outlook for 2011 by not taking into proper account lagging european and mediterranean bookings the consolidated amended complaint seeks unspecified damages interest and attorneys’ fees we believe the claims are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against them 

a class action complaint was filed in june 2011 against royal caribbean cruises ltd in the united states district court for the southern district of florida on behalf of a purported class of stateroom attendants employed onboard royal caribbean international cruise vessels alleging that they were required to pay other crew members to help with their duties in violation of the us seaman’s wage act the lawsuit also alleges that certain stateroom attendants were required to work back of house assignments without the ability to earn gratuities in violation of the us seaman’s wage act plaintiffs seek judgment for damages wage penalties and interest in an indeterminate amount we have filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the basis that the applicable collective bargaining agreement requires any such claims to be arbitrated we believe we have meritorious defenses to the lawsuit which we intend to vigorously pursue 

we commenced an action in june 2010 in the united states district court for puerto rico seeking a declaratory judgment that puerto rico’s distributorship laws do not apply to our relationship with an international representative located in puerto rico in september 2010 that international representative filed a number of counterclaims against royal caribbean cruises ltd and celebrity cruises inc alleging violations of puerto rico’s distributorship laws bad faith breach of contract tortious interference with contract violations of various federal and state antitrust and unfair competition laws the international representative is seeking in excess of 400 million on each of these counterclaims together with treble damages in the amount of 1200 million on several of the counterclaims as well as injunctive relief and declaratory judgment we believe that the claims made against us are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against them 

we are routinely involved in other claims typical within the cruise vacation industry the majority of these claims are covered by insurance we believe the outcome of such claims net of expected insurance recoveries will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations and cash flows

overview 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations has been organized to present the following 

 

  

  

   

 critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” see note 1 general and note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  certain of our accounting policies are deemed “critical” as they require management’s highest degree of judgment estimates and assumptions we have discussed these accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors we believe our most critical accounting policies are as follows 

ship accounting 

our ships represent our most significant assets and are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization depreciation of ships is generally computed net of a 15 projected residual value using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of the asset which is generally 30 years the 30 year useful life of our newly constructed ships and 15 associated residual value are both based on the weightedaverage of all major components of a ship our useful life and residual value estimates take into consideration the impact of anticipated technological changes longterm cruise and vacation market conditions and historical useful lives of similarlybuilt ships in addition we take into consideration our estimates of the weightedaverage useful lives of the ships’ major component systems such as hull superstructure main electric engines and cabins given the very large and complex nature of our ships our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain we do not have cost segregation studies performed to specifically componentize our ship systems therefore we estimate the costs of component systems based principally on general and technical information known about major ship component systems and their lives and our knowledge of the cruise vacation industry we do not identify and track depreciation by ship component systems but instead utilize these estimates to determine the net cost basis of assets replaced or refurbished improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized as additions to the ship and depreciated over the shorter of the improvements’ estimated useful lives or that of the associated ship the estimated cost and accumulated depreciation of replaced or refurbished ship components are written off and any resulting losses are recognized in cruise operating expenses 

we use the deferral method to account for drydocking costs under the deferral method drydocking costs incurred are deferred and charged to expense on a straightline basis over the period to the next scheduled drydock which we estimate to be a period of thirty to sixty months based on the vessel’s age as required by class deferred drydock costs consist of the costs to drydock the vessel and other costs incurred in connection with the drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessel’s class certification class certification is necessary in order for our cruise ships to be flagged in a specific country obtain liability insurance and legally operate as passenger cruise ships the activities associated with those drydocking costs cannot be performed while the vessel is in service and as such are done during a drydock as a planned major maintenance activity the significant deferred drydock costs consist of hauling and wharfage services provided by the drydock facility hull inspection and related activities eg scraping pressure cleaning bottom painting maintenance to steering propulsion stabilizers thruster equipment and ballast tanks port services such as tugs pilotage and line handling and freight associated with these items we perform a detailed analysis of the various activities performed for each drydock and only defer those costs that are directly related to planned major maintenance activities necessary to maintain class the costs deferred are not otherwise routinely periodically performed to maintain a vessel’s designed and intended operating capability repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred 

we use judgment when estimating the period between drydocks which can result in adjustments to the estimated amortization of drydock costs if the vessel is disposed of before the next drydock the remaining balance in deferred drydock is writtenoff to the gain or loss upon disposal of vessel in the period in which the sale takes place we also use judgment when identifying costs incurred during a drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessel’s class certification as compared to those costs attributable to repairs and maintenance which are expensed as incurred see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

  

we believe we have made reasonable estimates for ship accounting purposes however should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimates of ship useful lives or projected residual values depreciation expense could be materially higher or lower if circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making determinations as to whether ship improvements should be capitalized the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance costs could increase partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense if we had reduced our estimated average 30year ship useful life by one year depreciation expense for 2011 would have increased by approximately 270 million if our ships were estimated to have no residual value depreciation expense for 2011 would have increased by approximately 1430 million 

valuation of longlived assets goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

we review our ships and other longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable we evaluate asset impairment for our ships on an individual basis at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities the lowest level for which we maintain identifiable cash flows that are independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities is at the ship level see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statement under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  if estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of an asset an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the asset’s estimated fair value and its carrying value 

we estimate fair value based on quoted market prices in active markets if available if active markets are not available we base fair value on independent appraisals sales price negotiations and projected future cash flows discounted at a rate estimated by management to be commensurate with the business risk quoted market prices are often not available for individual reporting units and for indefinitelife intangible assets accordingly we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit and an indefinitelife intangible asset using an expected present value technique 

we review goodwill trademarks and tradenames which are our most significant indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or when events or circumstances dictate more frequently the impairment review for goodwill consists of a qualitative assessment of whether it is morelikelythannot that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount followed by a twostep process of determining the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it to the carrying value of the net assets allocated to the reporting unit if the qualitative assessment demonstrates that it is morelikelythannot that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value it is not necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to step one for any reporting unit in any period we can resume the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any subsequent period when performing the twostep process if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value no further analysis or writedown of goodwill is required if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of its net assets the implied fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all its underlying assets and liabilities including both recognized and unrecognized tangible and intangible assets based on their fair value if necessary goodwill is then written down to its implied fair value 

the impairment review for indefinitelife intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess if the fair value exceeds its carrying amount the indefinitelife intangible asset is not considered impaired other intangible assets assigned finite useful lives are amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives 

during the fourth quarter of 2011 we performed a qualitative assessment of whether it was morelikelythannot that our royal caribbean international reporting unit’s fair value was less than its carrying amount before applying the twostep goodwill impairment test the qualitative analysis included assessing the impact of certain factors such as general economic conditions limitations on accessing capital changes in forecasted operating results changes in fuel prices and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates based on our qualitative assessment we concluded that it was morelikelythannot that the estimated fair value of the royal caribbean international reporting unit exceeded its carrying value as of december 31 2011 and thus did not proceed to the twostep goodwill impairment test no indicators of impairment exist primarily because the reporting unit’s fair value has consistently exceeded its carrying value by a significant margin its financial performance has been solid in the face of mixed economic environments and forecasts of operating results generated by the reporting unit appear sufficient to support its carrying value 

  

in addition during the fourth quarter of 2011 we performed our annual impairment review of goodwill for pullmantur’s reporting unit at december 31 2011 the carrying amount of goodwill attributable to our pullmantur reporting unit was €3565 million or 4628 million we did not perform a qualitative assessment but instead proceeded directly to the twostep goodwill impairment test we estimated the fair value of the pullmantur reporting unit using a probabilityweighted discounted cash flow model the principal assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model are projected operating results weightedaverage cost of capital and terminal value significantly impacting these assumptions are the transfer of vessels from our other cruise brands to pullmantur cash flows were calculated using our 2012 projected operating results as a base to that base we added future years’ cash flows assuming multiple revenue and expense scenarios that reflect the impact on pullmantur’s reporting unit of different global economic environments beyond 2012 we assigned a probability to each revenue and expense scenario we discounted the projected cash flows using rates specific to pullmantur’s reporting unit based on its weightedaverage cost of capital based on the probabilityweighted discounted cash flows we determined the fair value of the pullmantur reporting unit exceeded its carrying value therefore we did not proceed to step two of the impairment analysis and we do not consider goodwill to be impaired 

the estimation of fair value utilizing discounted expected future cash flows includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of expected revenues operating costs marketing selling and administrative expenses interest rates ship additions and retirements as well as assumptions regarding the cruise vacation industry’s competitive environment and general economic and business conditions among other factors pullmantur is a brand targeted primarily at the spanish portuguese and latin american markets european economies continue to demonstrate instability in light of heightened concerns over sovereign debt issues as well as the impact that proposed austerity measures will have on certain markets the spanish economy has been more severely impacted than many other economies around the world where we operate and there is significant uncertainty as to whether or when it will recover in addition the recent costa concordia incident is having a near term negative impact on our earnings in 2012 while the impact in future years is uncertain if the spanish economy weakens further or recovers more slowly than contemplated in our discounted cash flow model if there are relatively modest changes to our projected future cash flows used in the impairment analyses especially in net yields or if certain transfers of vessels from our other cruise brands to the pullmantur fleet do not take place it is reasonably possible that an impairment charge of pullmantur’s reporting unit’s goodwill and trademark and trade names may be required 

the factors influencing the spanish economy and pullmantur’s operating cash flows discussed above could also affect the recoverability of pullmantur’s trademarks and trade names and deferred tax assets we also performed the annual impairment review of our trademarks and trade names during the fourth quarter of 2011 using a discounted cash flow model and the relieffromroyalty method the royalty rate used is based on comparable royalty agreements in the tourism and hospitality industry since these trademarks and trade names relate to pullmantur we used the same discount rate used in valuing the pullmantur reporting unit in our goodwill impairment test based on the discounted cash flow model we determined the fair value of our trademarks and trade names exceeded their carrying value 

as of december 31 2011 pullmantur had deferred tax assets of €259 million or 336 million resulting from net operating losses we regularly review deferred tax assets for recoverability based on our history of earnings expectations for future earnings and tax planning strategies we believe it is morelikelythannot that we will recover the deferred tax assets based on our expectation of future earnings and implementation of tax planning strategies realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income to support the amount of deferred tax assets it is possible we may need to establish a valuation allowance for a portion or all of the deferred tax asset balance if future earnings do not meet expectations or we are unable to successfully implement our tax planning strategies 

derivative instruments 

we enter into various forward swap and option contracts to manage our interest rate exposure and to limit our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices these instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value and the vast majority are designated as hedges we also have nonderivative financial instruments designated as hedges of our net investment in our foreign operations and investments the fuel options we have entered into represent economic hedges which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes and thus changes in their fair value are immediately recognized in earnings our derivative instruments are not held for trading or speculative purposes we account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with authoritative guidance refer 

  

to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies and note 13 fair value measurements and derivative instruments to our consolidated financial statements for more information on related authoritative guidance the company’s hedging programs and derivative financial instruments 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate crosscurrency and fuel swaps and options with third party institutions in overthecounter markets we estimate the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate and crosscurrency swaps using expected future cash flows based on the instruments’ contract terms and published forward curves for foreign currency exchange and interest rates we apply present value techniques and liborbased discount rates to convert the expected future cash flows to the current fair value of the instruments 

we estimate the fair value of our fuel swaps using expected future cash flows based on the swaps’ contract terms and forward prices we derive forward prices from forward fuel curves based on pricing inputs provided by thirdparty institutions that transact in the fuel indices we hedge we validate these pricing inputs against actual market transactions and published price quotes for similar assets we apply present value techniques and liborbased discount rates to convert the expected future cash flows to the current fair value of the instruments we also corroborate our fair value estimates using valuations provided by our counterparties 

we estimate the fair value for our fuel call options based on the prevailing market price for the instruments consisting of published price quotes for similar assets based on recent transactions in an active market 

we adjust the valuation of our derivative financial instruments to incorporate credit risk when applicable 

we believe it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate crosscurrency and fuel swaps and options would be derived from other appropriate valuation models using similar assumptions inputs or conditions suggested by actual historical experience 

contingencies—litigation 

on an ongoing basis we assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss if any can be made in assessing probable losses we take into consideration estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries if any we accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recoveries it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made 

seasonality 

our revenues are seasonal based on demand for cruises demand is strongest for cruises during the northern hemisphere’s summer months and holidays in order to mitigate the impact of the winter weather in the northern hemisphere and to capitalize on the summer season in the southern hemisphere our brands have increased deployment to south america and australia during the northern hemisphere winter months

our cruise operating expenses are comprised of the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 we do not allocate payroll and related costs food costs fuel costs or other operating costs to the expense categories attributable to passenger ticket revenues or onboard and other revenues since they are incurred to provide the total cruise vacation experience 

selected operational and financial metrics 

we utilize a variety of operational and financial metrics which are defined below to evaluate our performance and financial condition as discussed in more detail herein certain of these metrics are nongaap financial measures which we believe provide useful information to investors as a supplement to our consolidated financial statements which are prepared and presented in accordance with gaap the presentation of nongaap financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap 

available passenger cruise days “apcd” is our measurement of capacity and represents double occupancy per cabin multiplied by the number of cruise days for the period we use this measure to perform capacity and rate analysis to identify our main noncapacity drivers that cause our cruise revenue and expenses to vary 

gross cruise costs represent the sum of total cruise operating expenses plus marketing selling and administrative expenses 

gross yields represent total revenues per apcd 

  

net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel represent gross cruise costs excluding commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses and in the case of net cruise costs excluding fuel fuel each of which is described above under the description of certain line items heading in measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income we believe changes in net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance a reconciliation of historical gross cruise costs to net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel is provided below under results of operations  we have not provided a quantitative reconciliation of projected gross cruise costs to projected net cruise costs and projected net cruise costs excluding fuel due to the significant uncertainty in projecting the costs deducted to arrive at these measures accordingly we do not believe that reconciling information for such projected figures would be meaningful 

net debttocapital is a ratio which represents total longterm debt including current portion of longterm debt less cash and cash equivalents “net debt” divided by the sum of net debt and total shareholders’ equity we believe net debt and net debttocapital along with total longterm debt and shareholders’ equity are useful measures of our capital structure a reconciliation of historical debttocapital to net debttocapital is provided below under results of operations 

net revenues represent total revenues less commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses each of which is described above under the description of certain line items heading 

net yields represent net revenues per apcd we utilize net revenues and net yields to manage our business on a daytoday basis as we believe that it is the most relevant measure of our pricing performance because it reflects the cruise revenues earned by us net of our most significant variable costs which are commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses a reconciliation of historical gross yields to net yields is provided below under results of operations  we have not provided a quantitative reconciliation of projected gross yields to projected net yields due to the significant uncertainty in projecting the costs deducted to arrive at this measure accordingly we do not believe that reconciling information for such projected figures would be meaningful 

occupancy  in accordance with cruise vacation industry practice is calculated by dividing passenger cruise days by apcd a percentage in excess of 100 indicates that three or more passengers occupied some cabins 

passenger cruise days represent the number of passengers carried for the period multiplied by the number of days of their respective cruises 

we believe net yields net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel are our most relevant nongaap financial measures however a significant portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar because our reporting currency is the united states dollar the value of these revenues and expenses can be affected by changes in currency exchange rates although such changes in local currency prices is just one of many elements impacting our revenues and expenses it can be an important element for this reason we also monitor net yields net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel as if the current periods’ currency exchange rates had remained constant with the comparable prior periods’ rates or on a “constant currency” basis 

it should be emphasized that constant currency is primarily used for comparing shortterm changes andor projections over the longer term changes in guest sourcing and shifting the amount of purchases between currencies can significantly change the impact of the purely currencybased fluctuations 

the use of certain significant nongaap measures such as net yields net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel allow us to perform capacity and rate analysis to separate the impact of known capacity changes from other less predictable changes which affect our business we believe these nongaap measures provide expanded insight to measure revenue and cost performance in addition to the standard united states gaap based financial measures there are no specific rules or regulations for determining nongaap and constant currency measures and as such there exists the possibility that they may not be comparable to other companies within the industry 

  

executive overview 

during 2011 our business demonstrated its fundamental strength and the efficacy of our business model despite the impact of geopolitical events including the political unrest in the eastern mediterranean and northern africa and the earthquake and related events in japan as well as the uncertain global economic environment our net income for 2011 increased approximately 18 to 6074 million in 2011 from 5157 million in 2010 and our net yields increased 41 

prior to the recent tragedy in italy involving the costa concordia booking patterns for 2012 were strong and wave season traditionally the first two months of the year where cruise lines experience disproportionately higher volume cruise sales was off to an excellent start however the costa concordia incident is having a near term effect on our bookings and the impact on our earnings in 2012 and beyond remains uncertain refer to our outlook section for a further discussion on our expected future results 

the globalization of our operations continues to be a major initiative for 2012 and beyond especially within developmental markets during 2012 we expect a significant amount of our passenger ticket revenues from outside of the united states in 2012 royal caribbean international will focus on the development of key markets in southern europe and asia where we have established a leading position in the chinese market in furtherance of this during 2012 royal caribbean international will seasonally add a second ship in asia and a third ship in australia add new departure ports in southern europe in order to target guests in key source markets in the region and increase capacity in northern europe in addition celebrity cruises will have additional product offerings in australia and asia 

during 2012 we plan to further strengthen our consumer engagement by strategically investing in a number of potential revenue enhancing projects including further developing our customer loyalty programs expanding our international distribution system continuing with our vessel revitalization program introducing new onboard revenue initiatives and implementing various information technology infrastructure investments we believe these investments will provide opportunities for increased ticket and onboard revenues with the ultimate goal of maximizing our return on invested capital and longterm shareholder value in october 2012 celebrity cruises will introduce celebrity reflection  the fifth solsticeclass ship which will offer sailings in europe and the caribbean we also have two project sunshine vessels on order for royal caribbean international which are expected to enter service in the third quarter of 2014 and in the second quarter of 2015 respectively 

our liquidity position at the end of 2011 remained strong and our credit metrics have improved we continue to be focused on our goal of returning to an investment grade credit rating in 2011 we amended our 1225 billion unsecured revolving credit facility which was due to expire in june 2012 we have extended the termination date through july 2016 and reduced the facility amount to 8750 million this facility combined with our 5250 million unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in november 2014 provides us with access to 14 billion in revolving credit capacity as a result of our strong liquidity position in july 2011 our board of directors reinstated our quarterly dividend at a rate of 010 per share we anticipate funding our 2012 scheduled maturities and other obligations in 2012 through operating cash flows our current available revolving credit facilities and our current financing arrangements although we may opportunistically access the credit and capital markets 

results of operations 

summary 

year ended december 31 2011 

total revenues increased 116 to 75 billion in 2011 from total revenues of 68 billion in 2010 primarily due to a 75 increase in capacity measured by apcd for such period and a 41 increase in net yields the increase in net yields was primarily due to an increase in ticket prices and the favorable effect on our revenues of changes in foreign currency exchange rates these increases were partially offset by the impact of geopolitical events including the political unrest in the eastern mediterranean and northern africa and the earthquake and related events in japan these events resulted in deployment changes to avoid calling on ports in those areas and pricing reductions to stimulate demand in 

  

other areas the increase in total revenues was partially offset by higher operating expenses primarily due to the increase in capacity an increase in fuel expenses and to a lesser extent the unfavorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates our results for 2011 were also positively impacted by income from our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries of 222 million in 2011 as compared to income of 02 million in 2010 and a gain on our fuel call options of 189 million in 2011 as compared to a loss of 28 million in 2010 we also recorded a onetime gain during 2010 of approximately 890 million net of costs and payments to insurers related to a litigation settlement that did not recur in 2011 as a result our net income was 6074 million or 277 per share on a diluted basis for 2011 compared to 5157 million or 237 per share on a diluted basis for 2010

 outlook 

on february 2 2012 we announced the following initial first quarter and full year 2012 guidance 

full year 2012 

 

 first quarter 2012 

 

 in providing the above guidance we noted that prior to the costa concordia incident bookings had been running approximately 5 higher than the same time last year and at higher prices immediately after the incident we experienced a significant decline in new booking activity but cancellation activity remained at normal levels we believe the decline in new bookings was driven by the extensive media coverage of the incident and the curtailment of marketing activities by most cruise lines and travel agencies we also noted that the impact on bookings was the greatest for the first three quarters of 2012 while longer term bookings remained healthy 

  

over the last several weeks media coverage has subsided and normal marketing activity has resumed during this period we have continued to experience a slow improvement in year over year revenue build but the pace of bookings is still lower than at the same time last year and lower when compared to the rate of revenue build we were experiencing prior to the tragedy while booking patterns have not yet stabilized and a high degree of uncertainty remains our total booked load factors as of the date of this filing are at approximately the same level as at this same time last year and at modestly higher prices 

as is always the case when evaluating booking activity and expectations over diverse itineraries and markets it is difficult to reduce the volumes of data to a simple pattern nevertheless the general direction and tone of the market so far are consistent with our earlier expectations as indicated in our february 2 2012 guidance and our outlook for net yields and net cruise costs excluding fuel is essentially unchanged for the first quarter and for the full year of 2012 furthermore we continue to believe that the tragedy will not have a significant longterm impact on our business 

in addition we noted the following changes since our february 2 2012 announcement 

fuel prices fuel prices have increased since our previous guidance while we do not forecast fuel prices based on current at the pump prices net of hedging our fuel costs for the first quarter and full year of 2012 are estimated to be 229 million and 921 million respectively 

currency impacts the united states dollar has weakened relative to other currencies in which we transact business a weaker united states dollar tends to improve revenues and to a lesser extent increase expenses the weakening united states dollar thus has had a net positive impact of approximately 004 which has offset some of the increased fuel expense 

capacity there has been one minor change impacting capacity we previously expected a 21 increase in capacity primarily driven by the addition of celebrity silhouette  which entered service during the third quarter of 2011 we recently agreed to charter pullmantur’s ocean dream to a third party for 6 to 10 years beginning in april 2012 this will slightly reduce our capacity growth to about 15 in 2012 this change is not expected to have a material impact on our results 

except for the items noted above our expectations for 2012 results have not changed materially since our announcement on february 2 2012 

year ended december 31 2011 compared to year ended december 31 2010 

in this section references to 2011 refer to the year ended december 31 2011 and references to 2010 refer to the year ended december 31 2010 

revenues 

total revenues for 2011 increased 7848 million or 116 to 75 billion from 68 billion in 2010 approximately 5078 million of this increase was attributable to a 75 increase in capacity the increase in capacity was primarily due 

  

to a full year of revenue generated by allure of the seas which entered service in december 2010 the addition of celebrity silhouette which entered service in july 2011 and a full year of celebrity eclipse which entered service in april 2010 this increase in capacity was partially offset by the sale of celebrity mercury to tui cruises in february 2011 in addition approximately 2770 million of the increase in revenue was driven by an increase in ticket prices and the favorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar these increases were partially mitigated by the impact of geopolitical events including the political unrest in the eastern mediterranean and northern africa and the earthquake and related events in japan which offset pricing improvements in other regions these events resulted in deployment changes to avoid calling on ports in those areas and pricing reductions to stimulate demand in other areas 

onboard and other revenues included concession revenues of 2734 million in 2011 compared to 2370 million for the same period in 2010 the increase in concession revenues was due to an increase in spending on a per passenger basis and the increase in capacity mentioned above 

cruise operating expenses 

total cruise operating expenses for 2011 increased 4845 million or 109 to 49 billion from 45 billion for 2010 approximately 3352 million of the increase was attributable to the 75 increase in capacity mentioned above other significant drivers of the increase include an increase in fuel air and other hotel and vessel expenses and head taxes as well as the unfavorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our cruise operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar fuel expenses which are net of the financial impact of fuel swap agreements increased 184 per metric ton in 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily as a result of increasing fuel prices the increase in air and other hotel and vessel expenses and head taxes were primarily due to deployment changes 

marketing selling and administrative expenses 

marketing selling and administrative expenses for 2011 increased 1125 million or 133 to 9606 million from 8481 million for 2010 the increase was due to an increase in marketing selling and payroll expenses primarily associated with our international expansion and to a much lesser extent an increase in expenses associated with technological innovations 

depreciation and amortization expenses 

depreciation and amortization expenses for 2011 increased 587 million or 91 to 7024 million from 6437 million for 2010 the increase is primarily due to a full year of allure of the seas which entered service in december 2010 the addition of celebrity silhouette which entered service in july 2011 and a full year of celebrity eclipse which entered service in april 2010 these increases were partially offset by the sale of celebrity mercury to tui cruises and the sale of bleu de france  

other income expense 

interest expense net of interest capitalized  increased to 3824 million in 2011 from 3712 million in 2010 the increase was due to a reduction in interest capitalized for ships under construction interest capitalized decreased to 140 million in 2011 from 281 million in 2010 primarily due to a lower average level of investment in ships under construction gross interest expense decreased to 3964 million from 3993 million in 2010 the decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates partially offset by a higher average debt level 

other income decreased to 329 million in 2011 from 750 million in 2010 the 421 million decrease in other income was due primarily to an 890 million gain recorded from a litigation settlement during 2010 that did not recur in 2011 which was partially offset by 

 

  

   

net yields 

net yields increased 41 in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to an increase in ticket prices and the favorable impact of changes in exchange rates as discussed above net yields per apcd increased 24 in 2011 compared to 2010 on a constant currency basis 

net cruise costs 

net cruise costs increased 114 in 2011 compared to 2010 due to the 75 increase in capacity and a 37 increase in net cruise cost per apcd the increase in net cruise costs per apcd was primarily driven by an increase in fuel and other hotel and vessel expenses and to a lesser extent the unfavorable impact of changes in exchange rates as discussed above net cruise costs per apcd increased 27 in 2011 compared to 2010 on a constant currency basis net cruise costs excluding fuel per apcd increased 23 in 2011 compared to 2010 net cruise costs excluding fuel per apcd increased 13 in 2011 compared to 2010 on a constant currency basis 

year ended december 31 2010 compared to year ended december 31 2009 

in this section references to 2010 refer to the year ended december 31 2010 and references to 2009 refer to the year ended december 31 2009 

revenues 

total revenues for 2010 increased 8627 million or 146 to 68 billion from 59 billion in 2009 approximately 6541 million of this increase was attributable to an 111 increase in capacity the increase in capacity was primarily due to a full year of service of oasis of the seas  which entered service in december 2009 the addition of celebrity eclipse which entered service in april 2010 a full year of service of celebrity equinox which entered service in july 2009 a full year of service of pacific dream  which entered service in may 2009 and the addition of allure of the seas which entered service in december 2010 this increase in capacity was partially offset by the sale of celebrity galaxy to tui cruises in march 2009 the removal of the atlantic star from operation in august 2009 and the sale of oceanic in april 2009 in addition approximately 2086 million of the increase in total revenues was driven by increases in ticket prices and an increase in occupancy from 1025 in 2009 to 1043 in 2010 the increase in occupancy was primarily due to improving market conditions certain itinerary changes and the favorable impact of our newer ships the increase in occupancy was also due to the absence of the adverse effect caused by the h1n1 virus during the third quarter of 2009 which resulted in selective itinerary modifications and diminished demand for our cruises and tours to mexico these increases were partially offset by a decrease in air revenue due to a reduction in guests booking air service through us and an overall decrease in air ticket prices a decrease in shore excursions revenue on a per passenger basis related to seasonal redeployments and to a decrease in charter revenue due to the termination of the charter to island cruises in april 2009 these increases in revenues were also partially offset by the adverse effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar 

onboard and other revenues included concession revenues of 2370 million in 2010 compared to 2156 million for the same period in 2009 the increase in concession revenues was primarily due to the increase in capacity mentioned above 

cruise operating expenses 

total cruise operating expenses for 2010 increased 3870 million or 95 to 45 billion from 41 billion for 2009 approximately 4521 million of this increase was attributable to the 111 increase in capacity mentioned above the increase was also due to an increase in commissions directly related to the increase in ticket prices these increases were partially offset by a 302 million decrease primarily attributable to lower air expenses shore excursions expenses and fuel expenses on a per passenger basis and to a lesser extent our continued emphasis on costcontainment the decreases in air expenses and shore excursion expenses were directly related to the decreases in revenue as mentioned above the decrease in fuel expenses was primarily a result of improved fuel efficiencies related to our newer ships and the favorable effect of fuel swap agreements despite increasing fuel prices the increase in cruise operating expenses was also partially offset by an estimated 349 million decrease related to the favorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our cruise operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar 

  

marketing selling and administrative expenses 

marketing selling and administrative expenses for 2010 increased 861 million or 113 to 8481 million from 7620 million for 2009 the increase was primarily due to an increase in shoreside payroll and benefits due to higher headcount primarily related to our continued international expansion and general increases in compensation 

depreciation and amortization expenses 

depreciation and amortization expenses for 2010 increased 755 million or 133 to 6437 million from 5682 million for 2009 the increase was primarily due to the addition of oasis of the seas  the addition of celebrity eclipse and a full year of service of celebrity equinox  these increases were partially offset by the sale of celebrity galaxy to tui cruises the classification of the atlantic star as held for sale which accordingly was no longer being depreciated and the sale of oceanic  

other income expense 

interest expense net of interest capitalized  increased to 3712 million in 2010 from 3099 million in 2009 gross interest expense increased to 3993 million in 2010 from 3514 million in 2009 the increase was primarily due to a higher average debt level partially offset by lower interest rates interest capitalized decreased to 281 million in 2010 from 415 million in 2009 primarily due to a lower average level of investment in ships under construction and to a lesser extent lower interest rates 

other income was 750 million in 2010 compared to other expense of 331 million in 2009 for a net change of 1081 million when comparing these periods the increase was primarily due to an 890 million gain net of costs and payments to insurers recorded from the settlement with rolls royce 

net yields 

net yields increased 42 in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to the increase in ticket prices and the increase in occupancy as discussed above net yields on a constant currency basis remained consistent with net yields 

net cruise costs 

net cruise costs increased 91 in 2010 compared to 2009 due to the 111 increase in capacity partially offset by a 18 decrease in net cruise cost per apcd the decrease in net cruise costs per apcd was primarily driven by the decrease in fuel expenses our continued emphasis on costcontainment and by the absence in 2010 of a 71 million loss recognized during the third quarter of 2009 to reduce the carrying value of the atlantic star to its fair value less cost to sell when the ship was classified as held for sale net cruise costs per apcd on a constant currency basis remained consistent with net cruise costs per apcd

liquidity and capital resources 

sources and uses of cash 

cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity net cash provided by operating activities decreased 2073 million to 15 billion for 2011 compared to 17 billion for 2010 this decrease was primarily a result of the monetization of certain of our interest rate cross currency and fuel swap agreements which generated approximately 1730 million of cash during 2010 as compared to 122 million in 2011 and to cash received of 680 million related to a litigation settlement during 2010 which did not recur in 2011 

net cash used in investing activities was 9246 million in 2011 compared to 23 billion for 2010 during 2011 our use of cash was primarily related to capital expenditures of 12 billion down from 22 billion in 2010 the decrease in capital expenditures during 2011 was due to a decrease in the number of ships delivered in 2011 as compared to 2010 capital expenditures were primarily related to the delivery of celebrity silhouette during 2011 and the delivery of celebrity eclipse and allure of the seas during 2010 our utilization of cash from investing activities was offset by the receipt during 2011 of 2900 million from the sale of celebrity mercury and 550 million from the sale of bleu de france  in addition during 2011 we received 343 million in proceeds primarily from the sale of our fuel call options partially offset by cash paid on settlements on our foreign currency forward contracts of 180 million compared to 913 million of cash paid in 2010 on settlements on our foreign currency forward contracts we also provided approximately 1107 million in loans to our unconsolidated affiliates during 2011 which did not occur in 2010 

net cash used in financing activities was 6765 million for 2011 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 7570 million in 2010 this change was primarily due to an increase in repayments of debt of approximately 5788 million and a decrease in debt facility drawings of 8419 million the increase in repayments of debt was primarily due to our prepayment of 2000 million on our allure of the seas unsecured term loan and a repayment of 5000 million on a senior unsecured note in 2011 as compared to the repayment of 2500 million on a senior unsecured note in 2010 and to an increase of 650 million in repayments on our unsecured revolving credit facilities from 8200 million in 2010 to 8850 million in 2011 the 8419 million decrease in debt facility drawings during 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010 was primarily due to fewer ship deliveries during 2011 we drew 6320 million through an unsecured term loan to purchase celebrity silhouette and drew 9300 million on our unsecured revolving credit facilities whereas during 2010 we drew 17 billion through unsecured term loans to purchase celebrity eclipse and allure of the seas and drew 7150 million on our unsecured revolving credit facilities 

future capital commitments 

our future capital commitments consist primarily of new ship orders as of december 31 2011 we have celebrity reflection and our project sunshine ship under construction for an aggregate additional capacity of approximately 7100 berths in addition in february 2012 we exercised our option to construct a second project sunshine ship with a capacity of approximately 4100 berths which is expected to enter service in the second quarter of 2015 

as of december 31 2011 the aggregate cost of our ships on order was approximately 20 billion of which we had deposited 1858 million as of such date approximately 433 of the aggregate cost was exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate at december 31 2011 including our recently ordered second project sunshine ship the aggregate cost of our ships on order is approximately 28 billion these amounts do not include any costs associated with the construction agreement entered into by tui cruises to build its first newbuild ship see note 13 fair value measurements and derivative instruments and note 14 commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

as of december 31 2011 we anticipated overall capital expenditures will be approximately 12 billion for 2012 5000 million for 2013 and 11 billion for 2014 including our recently ordered second project sunshine ship our anticipated capital expenditures will be approximately 13 billion for 2012 6000 million for 2013 11 billion for 2014 and 10 billion for 2015 

  

contractual obligations 

as of december 31 2011 our contractual obligations were as follows in thousands 

 

  

        as a normal part of our business depending on market conditions pricing and our overall growth strategy we continuously consider opportunities to enter into contracts for the building of additional ships we may also consider the sale of ships or the purchase of existing ships we continuously consider potential acquisitions and strategic alliances if any of these were to occur they would be financed through the incurrence of additional indebtedness the issuance of additional shares of equity securities or through cash flows from operations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in july 2002 we entered into an operating lease denominated in british pound sterling for the brilliance of the seas  the lease payments vary based on sterling libor the lease has a contractual life of 25 years however both the lessor and we have certain rights to cancel the lease at years 10 ie 2012 and 18 ie 2020 upon advance notice given approximately one year prior to cancellation accordingly at the inception of the lease the lease term for accounting purposes was established to be 10 years in june 2011 the lessor advised us that it would not exercise its right to cancel the lease in 2012 and we subsequently made a determination that we will not exercise our right to cancel the lease in 2012 as a result we performed a lease classification analysis and concluded that the lease should continue to be classified as an operating lease in the event of early termination at year 18 we have the option to cause the sale of the vessel at its fair value and to use the proceeds towards the applicable termination payment alternatively we could opt at such time to make a termination payment of approximately £668 million or approximately 1038 million based on the exchange rate at december 31 2011 and relinquish our right to cause the sale of the vessel under current circumstances we do not believe early termination of this lease is probable 

under the brilliance of the seas operating lease we have agreed to indemnify the lessor to the extent its aftertax return is negatively impacted by unfavorable changes in corporate tax rates capital allowance deductions and certain unfavorable determinations which may be made by united kingdom tax authorities these indemnifications could result in an increase in our lease payments we are unable to estimate the maximum potential increase in our lease payments due to the various circumstances timing or a combination of events that could trigger such indemnifications we have been advised by the lessor that the united kingdom tax authorities are disputing the lessor’s accounting treatment of the 

  

lease and that the parties are in discussions on the matter if the characterization of the lease is ultimately determined to be incorrect we could be required to indemnify the lessor under certain circumstances the lessor has advised us that they believe their characterization of the lease is correct based on the foregoing and our review of available information we do not believe an indemnification is probable however if the lessor loses its dispute and we are required to indemnify the lessor we cannot at this time predict the impact that such an occurrence would have on our financial condition and results of operations 

in connection with the sale of celebrity mercury  we and tui ag each guaranteed repayment of 50 of an €1800 million 5year bank loan provided to tui cruises based on current facts and circumstances we do not believe potential obligations under this guarantee would be material to our results of operations 

tui cruises entered into a construction agreement with stx finland to build its first newbuild ship that includes certain restrictions on each of our and tui ag’s ability to reduce our current ownership interest in tui cruises below 375 through the construction period in addition the bank credit facility agreement associated with the financing of the newbuild extends this restriction through 2019 

some of the contracts that we enter into include indemnification provisions that obligate us to make payments to the counterparty if certain events occur these contingencies generally relate to changes in taxes increased lender capital costs and other similar costs the indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms and are entered into in the normal course of business there are no stated or notional amounts included in the indemnification clauses and we are not able to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments if any under these indemnification clauses we have not been required to make any payments under such indemnification clauses in the past and under current circumstances we do not believe an indemnification obligation is probable 

other than the items described above we are not party to any other offbalance sheet arrangements including guarantee contracts retained or contingent interest certain derivative instruments and variable interest entities that either have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial position 

funding sources 

we have significant contractual obligations of which the capital expenditures associated with our ship purchases and our debt service obligations represent our largest funding needs we have approximately 20 billion in contractual obligations due in 2012 of which approximately 7641 million relates to the acquisition of the celebrity reflection along with progress payments on our first project project sunshine ship 6264 million relates to debt maturities and 3297 million relates to interest on our longterm debt in addition we have 109 billion in contractual obligations due beyond 2012 of which debt maturities interest on our longterm debt and ship purchase obligations represent 78 billion 9910 million and 7878 million respectively we have historically relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations drawdowns under our available credit facilities the incurrence of additional debt andor the refinancing of our existing debt and the issuance of additional shares of equity securities to fund these obligations 

as of december 31 2011 our liquidity was 11 billion consisting of approximately 2622 million in cash and cash equivalents and 8100 million available under our unsecured revolving credit facilities during 2011 we amended and restated our 1225 billion unsecured revolving credit facility in order to among other things reduce the facility amount to 8750 million and extend the termination date until july 2016 together with the 5250 million unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in november 2014 we have total revolving credit capacity of 14 billion 

in addition we had a working capital deficit of 21 billion as of december 31 2011 as compared to our working capital deficit of 24 billion as of december 31 2010 similar to others in our industry we operate with a substantial working capital deficit because 1 passenger receipts are primarily paid in advance with a relatively lowlevel of accounts receivable 2 rapid turnover results in a limited investment in inventories and 3 voyagerelated accounts payable usually become due after receipt of cash from related bookings in addition we finance the purchase of our ships through longterm debt instruments we generate substantial cash flows from operations and our business model along with our unsecured revolving credit facilities has historically allowed us to maintain this working capital deficit and still meet our operating investing and financing needs we expect that we will continue to have working capital deficits in the future 

  

currently we have on order celebrity reflection and two project sunshine ships in germany each of which has committed bank financing arrangements which include sovereign financing guarantees 50 of the loans for our project sunshine ships are subject to syndication prior to delivery 

we continue our focus on ensuring adequate cash and liquidity we are committed to improving our cost focus and continue to implement cost containment initiatives including a number of initiatives to reduce energy consumption and by extension fuel costs these include the design of more fuel efficient ships and the implementation of other hardware and energy efficiencies we anticipate that our cash flows from operations our current available credit facilities and our current financing arrangements will be adequate to meet our capital expenditures and debt repayments over the next twelvemonth period in addition we may elect to fund our contractual obligations through other means if favorable opportunities arise our current and anticipated liquidity has also allowed us to reinstate our quarterly dividends refer to our discussion in the “dividends” section below 

if i any person other than a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates and their respective affiliates the “applicable group” acquires ownership of more than 30 of our common stock and the applicable group owns less of our common stock than such person or ii subject to certain exceptions during any 24month period a majority of the board is no longer comprised of individuals who were members of the board on the first day of such period we may be obligated to prepay indebtedness outstanding under the majority of our credit facilities which we may be unable to replace on similar terms certain of our outstanding debt securities also contain change of control provisions that would be triggered by the acquisition of greater than 50 of our common stock by a person other than a member of the applicable group coupled with a ratings downgrade if this were to occur it would have an adverse impact on our liquidity and operations 

debt covenants 

our financing agreements contain covenants that require us among other things to maintain minimum net worth of at least 57 billion a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 125x and limit our net debttocapital ratio to no more than 625 the fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated by dividing net cash from operations for the past four quarters by the sum of dividend payments plus scheduled principal debt payments in excess of any new financings for the past four quarters our minimum net worth and maximum net debttocapital calculations exclude the impact of accumulated other comprehensive loss income on total shareholders’ equity  we are well in excess of all debt covenant requirements as of december 31 2011 the specific covenants and related definitions can be found in the applicable debt agreements the majority of which have been previously filed with the securities and exchange commission 

dividends 

in july 2011 our board of directors reinstated our quarterly dividend which had been discontinued beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008 we declared and paid a cash dividend on our common stock of 010 per share during the third quarter of 2011 and declared a cash dividend on our common stock of 010 per share in december 2011 which was paid the first quarter of 2012 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial instruments and other 

general 

we are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices we manage these risks through a combination of our normal operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments pursuant to our hedging practices and policies the financial impacts of these hedging instruments are primarily offset by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures being hedged we achieve this by closely matching the amount term and conditions of the derivative instrument with the underlying risk being hedged we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes we monitor our derivative positions using techniques including market valuations and sensitivity analyses see note 13 fair value measurements and derivative instruments to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

  

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our longterm debt obligations including future interest payments and our operating lease for brilliance of the seas  at december 31 2011 approximately 40 of our longterm debt was effectively fixed and approximately 60 was floating we use interest rate swap agreements to modify our exposure to interest rate movements and to manage our interest expense and rent expense 

market risk associated with our longterm fixed rate debt is the potential increase in fair value resulting from a decrease in interest rates we use interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a portion of our fixedrate debt to a floatingrate basis to manage this risk at december 31 2011 we maintained interest rate swap agreements that effectively changed 3500 million of debt with a fixed rate of 725 to a liborbased floating rate equal to libor plus 172 currently approximately 249 additionally during 2011 we entered into interest rate swap agreements on the fixed rate portion of our oasis of the seas unsecured amortizing term loan the interest rate swap agreements effectively changed the unamortized balance of the unsecured term loan which was 3500 million at inception of the hedge with a fixed rate of 541 to liborbased floating rate equal to libor plus 387 currently approximately 448 

the estimated fair value of our longterm fixed rate debt at december 31 2011 was 43 billion using quoted market prices where available or using the present value of expected future cash flows which incorporates risk profile the fair value of our fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements was estimated to be an asset of 656 million as of december 31 2011 based on the present value of expected future cash flows a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates at december 31 2011 would increase the fair value of our longterm fixed rate debt by approximately 591 million net of an increase in the fair value of the associated fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements assuming no changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

market risk associated with our longterm floating rate debt is the potential increase in interest expense from an increase in interest rates we use interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a portion of our floatingrate debt to a fixedrate basis to manage this risk a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase our 2012 interest expense by approximately 380 million assuming no change in foreign currency exchange rates during 2011 we entered into forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements that beginning april 2013 effectively convert the interest rate on the celebrity reflection unsecured amortizing term loan balance for approximately 6272 million from libor plus 040 to a fixedrate of 285 inclusive of margin the fair value of our floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements was estimated to be a liability of 116 million as of december 31 2011 based on the present value of expected future cash flows 

market risk associated with our operating lease for brilliance of the seas is the potential increase in rent expense from an increase in sterling libor rates through july 2012 we have effectively changed 49 of the operating lease obligation from a floating rate to a fixed rate obligation with a weightedaverage rate of 476 through rate fixings with the lessor a hypothetical one percentage point increase in sterling libor rates would increase our 2012 rent expense by approximately 20 million based on the exchange rate at december 31 2011 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to our ship construction contracts denominated in euro and our growing international business operations we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and cross currency swap agreements to manage portions of the exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 

the estimated fair value as of december 31 2011 of our eurodenominated forward contracts associated with our ship construction contracts was estimated to be a liability of 365 million based on the present value of expected future cash flows during 2011 we implemented a strategy for benefiting from anticipated weakness in the euro exchange rate as part of that strategy we terminated our foreign currency forward contracts for project sunshine to allow the exchange rate to float within a predetermined range essentially creating a floor and a ceiling around our exposure to the euro denominated cost of the vessel we may adjust the range over time as we feel appropriate we effected the termination of a portion of the contracts by entering into offsetting foreign currency forward contracts we paid 87 million to terminate the remaining contracts and deferred a loss of 197 million within accumulated other comprehensive income 

  

loss which we will recognize within depreciation expense over the estimated useful life of the project sunshine ship as a result approximately 433 of the aggregate cost of the ships under construction was exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate at december 31 2011 a hypothetical 10 strengthening of the euro as of december 31 2011 assuming no changes in comparative interest rates would result in a 813 million increase in the united states dollar cost of the foreign currency denominated ship construction contracts exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate 

our growing international business operations subject us to an increasing level of foreign currency exchange risk we transact business in many different foreign currencies and maintain investments in foreign operations which may expose us to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates movements in foreign currency exchange rates may affect the translated value of our earnings and cash flows we manage most of this exposure on a consolidated basis which allows us to take advantage of any natural offsets therefore weakness in one particular currency might be offset by strengths in other currencies over time our earnings are also subject to volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the united states dollar to mitigate our foreign currency exchange rate exposure resulting from our net foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities we maintain cross currency swap agreements denominate a portion of our debt in our subsidiaries’ and investments’ functional currencies and enter into foreign currency forward contracts 

at december 31 2011 we maintained cross currency swap agreements that effectively change €1500 million of our €10 billion debt with a fixed rate of 5625 to 1909 million of debt at a fixed rate of 668 consistent with our strategy for benefiting from anticipated weakness in the euro exchange rate and to further increase the portion of our €10 billion debt that we utilize as a net investment hedge of our euro denominated investments in foreign operations during 2011 we terminated €2500 million of our cross currency swap agreements upon termination of these cross currency swaps we received net cash proceeds of approximately 122 million and we deferred a loss of 35 million within accumulated other comprehensive income loss which we will recognize within interest expense net of capitalized interest over the remaining life of the debt at december 31 2011 the estimated fair value of our cross currency swap agreements was an asset of approximately 77 million based on the present value of expected future cash flows a hypothetical 10 strengthening of the euro as of december 31 2011 assuming no changes in comparative interest rates would result in an increase in the fair value of the €1500 million of fixed rate debt by 217 million offset by an increase in the fair value of the cross currency swap agreements of 304 million 

we partially address the exposure of our investments in foreign operations by denominating a portion of our debt in our subsidiaries’ and investments’ functional currencies specifically we have assigned debt of €6650 million or approximately 8632 million as a hedge of our net investment in foreign operations accordingly we have included approximately 132 million of foreigncurrency transaction gains in the foreign currency translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss at december 31 2011 a hypothetical 10 increase or decrease in the december 31 2011 foreign currency exchange rate would increase or decrease the fair value of our assigned debt by 921 million which would be offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the united states dollar value of our net investment 

lastly during 2011 we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize volatility in earnings resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and payables denominated in a currency other than the united states dollar on a weekly basis we enter into an average of approximately 2620 million of these foreign currency forward contracts these instruments generally settle on a weekly basis and are not designated as hedging instruments changes in the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts are recognized in earnings within other income expense in our consolidated statements of operations 

fuel price risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices primarily relates to the consumption of fuel on our ships fuel cost net of the financial impact of fuel swap agreements as a percentage of our total revenues was approximately 101 in 2011 96 in 2010 and 102 in 2009 we use a range of instruments including fuel swap agreements and fuel call options to mitigate the financial impact of fluctuations in fuel prices during 2011 we terminated 100 of our fuel call options maturing in 2011 and 2012 in order to monetize previously recorded gains pertaining to the fuel call options’ fair value prior to their expiration upon termination of these options we recognized a gain of approximately 73 million and received net cash proceeds of approximately 343 million 

  

as of december 31 2011 we had fuel swap agreements to pay fixed prices for fuel with an aggregate notional amount of approximately 11 billion maturing through 2015 the fuel swap agreements represent 55 of our projected 2012 fuel requirements 47 of our projected 2013 fuel requirements 30 of our projected 2014 fuel requirements and 20 of our projected 2015 fuel requirements the estimated fair value of these contracts at december 31 2011 was estimated to be an asset of 798 million as of december 31 2011 we had fuel call options on a total of 10 million barrels which mature in 2013 the fuel call options represent 9 of our projected 2013 fuel requirements the estimated fair value of these contracts at december 31 2011 was an asset of approximately 164 million we estimate that a hypothetical 10 increase in our weightedaverage fuel price from that experienced during the year ended december 31 2011 would increase our 2012 fuel cost by approximately 420 million net of the impact of fuel swap agreements

industry 

cruising is considered a well established vacation sector in the north american market a growing sector in the european market and a developing but promising sector in several other emerging markets industry data indicates that a significant portion of cruise guests carried are firsttime cruisers we believe this could present an opportunity for longterm growth and a potential for increased profitability 

  

we estimate that the global cruise industry carried 187 million cruise passengers in 2010 compared to 173 million cruise passengers carried in 2009 we estimate that the global cruise fleet was served by approximately 400000 berths on approximately 281 ships by the end of 2010 there are approximately 20 ships with an estimated 53000 berths that are expected to be placed in service in the global cruise market between 2011 and 2014 the majority of cruise passengers in the cruise vacation industry have historically been sourced from north america and to a lesser extent europe 

north america 

although the north american cruise market has historically experienced significant growth the compound annual growth rate in cruise passengers for this market was approximately 09 from 2006 to 2010 this more limited growth is attributable in large part to the recent international expansion within the cruise industry we estimate that north america was served by 136 ships with approximately 190000 berths at the beginning of 2006 and by 151 ships with approximately 241000 berths by the end of 2010 there are approximately 13 ships with an estimated 36000 berths that are expected to be placed in service in the north american cruise market between 2011 and 2014 

europe 

in europe cruising represents a much smaller sector of the vacation industry however it has experienced a compound annual growth rate in cruise passengers of approximately 124 from 2006 to 2010 and we believe this market has significant continued growth potential we estimate that europe was served by 100 ships with approximately 94000 berths at the beginning of 2006 and by 114 ships with approximately 144000 berths by the end of 2010 there are approximately seven ships with an estimated 16000 berths that are expected to be placed in service in the european cruise market between 2011 and 2014 

the following table details the growth in the global north american and european cruise markets in terms of cruise passengers and estimated weightedaverage berths over the past five years 

 

  

   we compete with a number of cruise lines however our principal competitors are carnival corporation  plc which owns among others aida cruises carnival cruise lines costa cruises cunard line holland america line iberocruceros po cruises and princess cruises disney cruise line msc cruises norwegian cruise line and oceania cruises cruise lines compete with other vacation alternatives such as landbased resort hotels and sightseeing destinations for consumers’ leisure time demand for such activities is influenced by political and general economic conditions companies within the vacation market are dependent on consumer discretionary spending

we maintain war risk insurance including terrorist risk insurance on each ship through a norwegian war risk insurance organization this coverage includes coverage for physical damage to the ship which is not covered under the hull policies as a result of war exclusion clauses in such hull policies we also maintain protection and indemnity war risk coverage for risks that would be excluded by the rules of the indemnity insurance organizations subject to certain limitations consistent with most marine war risk policies under the terms of our war risk insurance coverage underwriters can give seven days notice to us that the policy will be canceled and reinstated at higher premium rates

we do not carry business interruption insurance for our ships based on our evaluation of the risks involved and protective measures already in place as compared to the cost of insurance we carry business interruption insurance for certain of our shoreside operations 

all insurance coverage is subject to certain limitations exclusions and deductible levels in addition in certain circumstances we coinsure a portion of these risks premiums charged by insurance carriers including carriers in the maritime insurance industry increase or decrease from time to time and tend to be cyclical in nature these cycles are impacted both by our own loss experience and by losses incurred in direct and reinsurance markets we historically have 

  

been able to obtain insurance coverage in amounts and at premiums we have deemed to be commercially acceptable no assurance can be given that affordable and secure insurance markets will be available to us in the future particularly for war risk insurance 

the athens convention relating to the carriage of passengers and their luggage by sea 1974 and the 1976 protocol to the athens convention are generally applicable to passenger ships the united states has not ratified the athens convention however with limited exceptions the 1976 athens convention protocol may be contractually enforced with respect to those of our cruises that do not call at a united states port the international maritime organization diplomatic conference agreed upon a new protocol to the athens convention on november 1 2002 the 2002 protocol which is not yet in force substantially increases the level of compulsory insurance which must be maintained by passenger ship operators no assurance can be given as to if or when the 2002 protocol will come into force if in force no assurance can be given that affordable and secure insurance markets will be available to provide the level of coverage required under the 2002 protocol 

trademarks 

we own a number of registered trademarks related to the royal caribbean international celebrity cruises azamara club cruises pullmantur and cdf croisières de france cruise brands the registered trademarks include the name “royal caribbean” and its crown and anchor logo the name “celebrity cruises” and its “x” logo the name “azamara club cruises” and its logo the names “pullmantur cruises” and “pullmantur” and their logos the name “cdf croisières de france” and its logo and the names of various cruise ships we believe our trademarks are widely recognized throughout the world and have considerable value 

regulation 

our ships are regulated by various international national state and local laws regulations and treaties in force in the jurisdictions in which they operate in addition our ships are registered in the bahamas malta or in the case of celebrity xpedition  ecuador each ship is subject to regulations issued by its country of registry including regulations issued pursuant to international treaties governing the safety of our ships guests and crew as well as environmental protection each country of registry conducts periodic inspections to verify compliance with these regulations as discussed more fully below ships operating out of united states ports are subject to inspection by the united states coast guard for compliance with international treaties and by the united states public health service for sanitary conditions our ships are also subject to similar inspections pursuant to the laws and regulations of various other countries our ships visit 

we believe that we are in material compliance with all the regulations applicable to our ships and that we have all licenses necessary to conduct our business health safety security environmental and financial responsibility issues are and we believe will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant government authorities in the united states and internationally from time to time various regulatory and legislative changes may be proposed that could impact our operations and subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 

safety regulations 

our ships are required to comply with international safety standards defined in the international convention for safety of life at sea “solas” which among other things establishes requirements for ship design structural features materials construction life saving equipment and safe management and operation of ships to ensure guest and crew safety the solas standards are revised from time to time and the most recent modifications were phased in through 2010 compliance with these modified standards did not a have a material effect on our operating costs solas incorporates the international safety management code “ism code” which provides an international standard for the safe management and operation of ships and for pollution prevention the ism code is mandatory for passenger vessel operators all of our operations and ships are regularly audited by national authorities and maintain the required certificates of compliance with the ism code 

in july 2010 the us adopted the cruise vessel security and safety act of 2010 which applies to passenger vessels which embark or include port stops within the united states this act requires the implementation of certain safety design features as well the establishment of practices for the reporting of and dealing with allegations of crime we do not expect that compliance with these provisions will require any material expenditures or materially increase our operating costs 

  

security regulations 

our ships are subject to various security requirements including the international ship and port facility security code “isps code” which is part of solas and the us maritime transportation security act of 2002 “mtsa” which applies to ships that operate in us ports in order to satisfy these security requirements we implement security measures conduct vessel security assessments and develop security plans the security plans for all of our ships have been submitted to and approved by the respective countries of registry for our ships in compliance with the isps code and the mtsa 

environmental regulations 

we are subject to various united states and international laws and regulations relating to environmental protection under such laws and regulations we are prohibited from among other things discharging certain materials such as petrochemicals and plastics into the waterways we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations from time to time environmental and other regulators consider more stringent regulations which may affect our operations and increase our compliance costs we believe that the impact of cruise ships on the global environment will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world and accordingly will likely subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 

our ships are subject to the international maritime organization’s “imo” regulations under the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships the “marpol regulations” which includes requirements designed to prevent and minimize pollution by oil sewage garbage and air emissions we have obtained the relevant international compliance certificates relating to oil sewage and air pollution prevention for all of our ships 

on january 1 2010 a european union directive regarding the use of low sulfur fuels for ships became effective the directive places a 01 sulfur content limit on all marine fuels used by such ships while berthed or anchored in european union ports compliance with this directive requires us to use distillate fuels such as marine gas oil this has not had a material effect on our fuel and operating costs 

the marpol regulations impose global limitations on the sulfur content of fuel used by ships operating worldwide which are currently 45 and are required to be reduced to 35 by january 1 2012 we do not expect that this required reduction will have a material effect on our fuel and operating costs these regulations will also require the worldwide limitations on sulfur content of fuel to be reduced to 05 by january 1 2020 subject to a feasibility review to be completed by imo no later than 2018 if such a reduced limitation is implemented worldwide in 2020 our fuel costs could increase significantly 

the marpol regulations also establish special emission control areas “ecas” with stringent limitations on sulfur and nitrogen oxide emissions in these areas as of july 1 2010 ships operating in designated ecas were required to reduce their fuel sulfur content from 15 to 10 under these regulations ships operating in ecas will be required to further reduce their fuel sulfur content to 01 beginning on january 1 2015 

as of the date of this report both the baltic sea and the north seaenglish channel have been established as ecas during 2010 the imo accepted and adopted the application by the united states france and canada to designate as an eca waters within 200 nautical miles of their east west and gulf coasts as applicable as well as the hawaiian islands but excluding certain areas within the caribbean basin such as the bahamas the canadian arctic western alaska and the aleutian islands this designation will be effective as of august 1 2012 in addition the united states has applied to designate the waters surrounding puerto rico and the us virgin islands as an eca this request was approved by the imo at the marine environment protection committee in september 2010 if adopted this eca would likely come into effect during the summer of 2013 

as of the date hereof the required sulfur content reductions in the existing ecas has not had a material impact on our operations and we do not expect the initial required sulfur content reductions in either the united states and canadian eca or the proposed puerto ricous virgin islands eca will have a material effect on our fuel and operating costs however the additional reduction to 01 as of january 1 2015 could significantly increase our costs after this date based on current capacities fuel prices itineraries and technologies the cost impact from implementing progressively 

  

lower sulfur content requirements after january 1 2015 is not reasonably determinable given the length of time until such possible implementation and the applicability of many possible mitigating factors such as changes in the future supply and demand for fuel the development of emissions abatement technologies including new engine designs or exhaust gas treatment systems the cost migration effects of equivalent compliance initiatives and new fuel conservation initiatives 

we are required to obtain certificates from the united states coast guard relating to our ability to satisfy liability in cases of water pollution pursuant to united states coast guard regulations we arrange through our insurers for the provision of guarantees aggregating 3472 million as a condition to obtaining the required certificates 

labor regulations 

the international labour organization an agency of the united nations that develops worldwide employment standards has adopted a new consolidated maritime labour convention the “convention” the convention which will be effective one year following ratification by at least 30 countries representing at least 33 of the world gross tonnage reflects standards and conditions to govern all aspects of crew management for ships in international commerce including additional requirements relating to the health safety and status of crewmembers not previously in effect the convention is expected to be ratified sometime in 2011 in which case it would enter into force in 2012 our expenses will likely increase following its effectiveness however the amount of the increase is not reasonably determinable pending the enactment of legislation to implement new standards outlined in the convention by the enacting countries 

consumer financial responsibility regulations 

we are required to obtain certificates from the united states federal maritime commission relating to our ability to satisfy liability in cases of nonperformance of obligations to guests as well as casualty and personal injury pursuant to the united states federal maritime commission regulations we arrange through our insurers for the provision of guarantees aggregating 300 million for our shipoperating companies as a condition to obtaining the required certificates in december 2009 the united states federal maritime commission issued an inquiry to solicit information concerning the benefits and burdens of the financial responsibility regulations which could result in enactment of revisions to the regulations that could significantly increase the amount of our bonds and accordingly increase our costs of compliance 

we are also required by the united kingdom and other jurisdictions to establish our financial responsibility for any liability resulting from the nonperformance of our obligations to guests from these jurisdictions in the united kingdom we are currently required by the association of british travel agents to provide performance bonds totaling approximately £305 million we are also required to pay to the united kingdom civil aviation authority a nonrefundable levy of £250 per guest where we arrange a flight as part of the cruise vacation 

regulations regarding protection of disabled persons 

in 2010 the united states department of transportation issued regulations the “new ada regulations” addressing various issues applicable to passenger vessels under the american with disabilities act the “ada” part i of the new ada regulations which include required reservation policies for disabled guests and requirements for aids and services to disabled passengers became effective starting in january 2011 we are in compliance with part i of the new ada regulations and did not make any material expenditures to comply part ii when issued is expected to address physical accessibility standards while we believe our vessels have been designed and outfitted to meet the needs of our disabled guests we cannot at this time accurately predict whether we will be required to make material modifications or incur significant additional expenses in response to part ii of the new ada regulations 

  

taxation of the company 

united states federal income tax 

the following discussion of the application of the united states federal income tax laws to us and our subsidiaries is based on the current provisions of the united states internal revenue code treasury department regulations administrative rulings and court decisions all of the foregoing is subject to change and any such change could affect the accuracy of this discussion 

application of section 883 of the internal revenue code 

we and our subsidiary celebrity cruises inc the operator of celebrity cruises and azamara club cruises are foreign corporations engaged in a trade or business in the united states and our shipowning subsidiaries are foreign corporations that in many cases depending upon the itineraries of their ships receive income from sources within the united states under section 883 of the internal revenue code certain foreign corporations are not subject to united states federal income or branch profits tax on united states source income derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships including income from the leasing of such ships 

a foreign corporation will qualify for the benefits of section 883 if in relevant part 1 the foreign country in which the foreign corporation is organized grants an equivalent exemption to corporations organized in the united states and 2a more than 50 of the value of the corporation’s capital stock is owned directly or indirectly by individuals who are residents of a foreign country that grants such an equivalent exemption to corporations organized in the united states or b the stock of the corporation or the direct or indirect corporate parent thereof is “primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market” in the united states or another qualifying country such as norway in the opinion of our united states tax counsel drinker biddle  reath llp based on the representations and assumptions set forth in that opinion we celebrity cruises inc and our shipowning subsidiaries qualify for the benefits of section 883 because we and each of those subsidiaries are incorporated in liberia or malta which are qualifying countries and our common stock is primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market in the united states or norway if in the future 1 liberia no longer qualifies as an equivalent exemption jurisdiction and we do not reincorporate in a jurisdiction that does qualify for the exemption or 2 we fail to qualify as a publicly traded corporation we and all of our shipowning or operating subsidiaries that rely on section 883 for tax exemption on qualifying income would be subject to united states federal income tax on their united states source shipping income and income from activities incidental thereto 

we believe that most of our income and the income of our shipowning subsidiaries is derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships and therefore is exempt from taxation under section 883 in 2005 final regulations became effective under section 883 which among other things narrowed somewhat the scope of activities that are considered by the internal revenue service to be incidental to the international operation of ships the activities listed in the regulations as not being incidental to the international operation of ships include income from the sale of air and land transportation shore excursions and pre and postcruise tours to the extent the income from these activities is earned from sources within the united states that income will be subject to united states taxation 

under certain circumstances changes in the identity residence or holdings of our direct or indirect shareholders could cause our common stock not to be “regularly traded on an established securities market” within the meaning of the regulations under section 883 to substantially reduce any such risk in may 2000 our articles of incorporation were amended to prohibit any person other than our two existing largest shareholders from owning directly or constructively as determined for purposes of section 883c3 of the internal revenue code and the regulations promulgated under it more than 49 of the relevant class or classes of our shares under liberian law this amendment may not be enforceable with respect to shares of common stock that were voted against the amendment or that were recorded as abstaining from the vote 

also it should be noted that section 883 has been the subject of legislative modifications in past years that have had the effect of limiting its availability to certain taxpayers and there can be no assurance that future legislation will not preclude us from obtaining the benefits of section 883 

  

taxation in the absence of an exemption under section 883 of the internal revenue code 

if we celebrity cruises inc or our shipowning subsidiaries were to fail to meet the requirements of section 883 of the internal revenue code or if the provision was repealed then as explained below such companies would be subject to united states income taxation on a portion of their income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships 

because we and celebrity cruises inc conduct a trade or business in the united states we and celebrity cruises inc would be taxable at regular corporate rates on our separate company taxable income ie without regard to the income of our shipowning subsidiaries from united states sources which includes 100 of income if any from transportation that begins and ends in the united states not including possessions of the united states 50 of income from transportation that either begins or ends in the united states and no income from transportation that neither begins nor ends in the united states the legislative history of the transportation income source rules suggests that a cruise that begins and ends in a united states port but that calls on more than one foreign port will derive united states source income only from the first and last legs of such cruise this conclusion is not free from doubt however because there are no regulations or other internal revenue service interpretations of the above rules in addition if any of our earnings and profits effectively connected with our united states trade or business were withdrawn or were deemed to have been withdrawn from our united states trade or business those withdrawn amounts would be subject to a “branch profits” tax at the rate of 30 the amount of such earnings and profits would be equal to the aforesaid united states source income with certain generally minor adjustments less income taxes we and celebrity cruises inc would also be potentially subject to tax on portions of certain interest paid by us at rates of up to 30 

if section 883 were not available to our shipowning subsidiaries each such subsidiary would be subject to a special 4 tax on its united states source gross transportation income if any each year because it does not have a fixed place of business in the united states and its income is derived from the leasing of a ship such united states source gross transportation income may be determined under any reasonable method including ratios of days traveling directly to or from united states ports to total days traveling or of the lessee’s united states source gross income from the ship as determined under the source rules discussed in the preceding paragraph and subject to the assumptions and qualifications set forth therein to the lessee’s total gross income from the ship 

maltese income tax 

our pullmantur ship owneroperator subsidiaries qualify as licensed shipping organizations in malta no maltese income tax is charged on the income derived from shipping activities of a licensed shipping organization instead a licensed shipping organization is liable to pay a tonnage tax based on the net tonnage of the ship or ships registered under the relevant provisions of the merchant shipping act a company qualifies as a shipping organization if it engages in qualifying activities and it obtains a license from the registrargeneral to enable it to carry on such activities qualifying activities include but are not limited to the ownership operation under charter or otherwise administration and management of a ship or ships registered as a maltese ship in terms of the merchant shipping act and the carrying on of all ancillary financial security and commercial activities in connection therewith 

our maltese operations that do not qualify as licensed shipping organizations which are not considered significant remain subject to normal maltese corporate income tax 

united kingdom income tax 

the brilliance of the seas is operated by a company that is strategically and commercially managed in the united kingdom which has elected to be subject to the united kingdom tonnage tax regime “uk tonnage tax” commencing in 2011 to facilitate our growth strategy an additional eleven ships from our fleet will be operated by a newly created company that is strategically and commercially managed in the united kingdom and will also elect to be subject to the uk tonnage tax regime 

companies subject to uk tonnage tax pay a corporate tax on a notional profit determined with reference to the net tonnage of qualifying vessels normal united kingdom corporate income tax is not chargeable on the relevant shipping profits of a qualifying uk tonnage tax company the requirements for a company to qualify for the uk tonnage tax 

  

regime include being subject to united kingdom corporate income tax operating qualifying ships which are strategically and commercially managed in the united kingdom and fulfilling a seafarer training requirement failure to meet any of these requirements could cause us to lose the benefit of the tonnage tax regime which will have a material effect on our results of operations 

relevant shipping profits include income from the operation of qualifying ships and from shipping related activities our united kingdom income from nonshipping activities which do not qualify under the uk tonnage tax regime and which are not considered significant remain subject to united kingdom corporate income tax 

state taxation 

we celebrity cruises inc and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various united states state income taxes which are generally imposed on each state’s portion of the united states source income subject to federal income taxes additionally the state of alaska subjects an allocated portion of the total income of companies doing business in alaska and certain other affiliated companies to alaska corporate state income taxes and also imposes a 33 tax on income from onboard gambling activities conducted in alaska waters this did not have a material impact to our results of operations for all years presented 

other taxation 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to income tax in the united states or other jurisdictions on income that does not qualify for exemption under section 883 or tonnage tax regimes the tax on such income was not material to our results of operations for all years presented

 item 1a risk factors 

the risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k are important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historical results it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks the risks described below are only those known risks relating to our operations and financial condition that we consider material there may be additional risks that we consider not to be material or which are not known and any of these risks could have the effects set forth below   see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a cautionary note regarding forwardlooking statements 

adverse worldwide economic conditions could reduce the demand for cruises and adversely impact our operating results cash flows and financial condition 

the demand for cruises is affected by international national and local economic and business conditions and is sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending the recent severe economic downturn coupled with continued negative economic indicators including high unemployment rates the volatility in the price of fuel and declines in the securities real estate and other markets has had an adverse effect on vacationers’ discretionary income and consumer confidence this in turn has resulted in cruise booking slowdowns decreased cruise prices and lower onboard revenues for us and for the others in the cruise industry although the cruise industry began to recover in 2010 we cannot 

  

predict with any certainty whether demand for cruises will continue to improve or the rate of such improvement stagnant or worsening global economic conditions could result in a prolonged period of booking slowdowns depressed cruise prices and reduced onboard revenues this could adversely impact our operating results cash flows and financial condition including the impairment of the value of our ships goodwill and other assets 

we may not be able to obtain sufficient financing or capital for our needs or may not be able to do so on terms that are acceptable or consistent with our expectations 

to fund our capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments we have historically relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations drawdowns under available credit facilities the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the sale of equity or debt securities in private or public securities markets the decrease in consumer cruise spending as a result of the recent severe economic downturn had an adverse impact on our cash flows from operations and if the current economic conditions worsen our operational cash flows could continue to be negatively affected see “ –adverse worldwide economic conditions could reduce the demand for cruises and adversely impact our operating results cash flows and financial condition ” 

although we believe we have or can access sufficient liquidity to fund our operations and obligations as expected there can be no assurances to that effect our ability to timely refinance andor replace our credit facilities on acceptable terms and our ability to access additional funding as may be needed will depend upon continued and sustained improvements in the financial markets as well as our financial results and credit ratings and the performance of our industry in general in addition our ability to make draws under our revolving credit facilities is subject to the absence of any material adverse changes in our business 

our inability to satisfy the covenants required by our credit facilities would adversely impact our liquidity 

our debt agreements contain covenants including covenants restricting our ability to take certain actions and financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum net worth and fixed charge coverage ratios and limit our net debttocapital ratio our ability to comply with the terms of our outstanding facilities may be affected by general economic conditions industry conditions and other events some of which may be beyond our control our failure to comply with the terms of our debt facilities could result in an event of default generally if an event of default under any debt agreement occurs then pursuant to cross default acceleration clauses substantially all of our outstanding debt and derivative contract payables could become due andor terminated we cannot provide assurances that we would have sufficient liquidity to repay or refinance the borrowings under any of the credit facilities or settle our outstanding derivative contracts if such amounts were accelerated upon an event of default 

in addition we have agreements with a number of credit card companies and processors that accept credit cards for the sale of cruises and other services under certain of these agreements the credit card processor may hold back a reserve from our credit card receivables following the occurrence of certain events including a default under our major credit facilities as of december 31 2010 we were not required to maintain any reserve under such agreements if circumstances were to occur that would allow a credit card processor to require us to maintain a reserve our liquidity would be negatively impacted 

the impact of disruptions in the global financial markets may affect the ability of our counterparties and others to perform their obligations to us 

the recent severe economic downturn including failures of financial service companies and the related liquidity crisis disrupted the capital and credit markets a recurrence of these disruptions could cause our counterparties and others to breach their obligations to us under our contracts with them this could include failures of banks or other financial service companies to fund required borrowings under our loan agreements or to pay us amounts that may become due under our derivative contracts for hedging of fuel prices interest rates and foreign currencies or other agreements if this occurs it may have a negative impact on our cash flows including our ability to meet our obligations results of operations and financial condition 

  

the increase in capacity resulting from delivery of newbuilds currently on order within the cruise industry could further adversely impact the demand for cruises or cruise pricing 

a total of 20 new ships are on order for delivery through 2014 in the cruise industry two of which are ours the further growth in capacity from these new ships without an increase in the cruise industry’s share of the vacation market could depress cruise prices and compound our ability to achieve yield improvement 

if we are unable to appropriately balance our cost management strategy with our goal of satisfying guest expectations it may adversely impact our business success 

our goals are to provide high quality products and deliver high quality services there can be no assurances that we can successfully balance these goals with our cost containment strategy 

we may lose business to competitors throughout the vacation market  

we operate in the vacation market and cruising is one of many alternatives for people choosing a vacation we therefore risk losing business not only to other cruise lines but also to other vacation operators which provide other leisure options including hotels resorts and package holidays and tours 

we face significant competition from other cruise lines on the basis of cruise pricing travel agent preference and also in terms of the nature of ships and services we offer to guests our principal competitors within the cruise vacation industry include carnival corporation  plc which owns among others aida cruises carnival cruise lines costa cruises cunard line holland america line iberocruceros po cruises and princess cruises disney cruise line msc cruises norwegian cruise line and oceania cruises 

in the event that we do not compete effectively with other vacation alternatives and cruise companies our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

fears of terrorist and pirate attacks war and other hostilities and the spread of contagious diseases could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

events such as terrorist and pirate attacks war and other hostilities and the resulting political instability travel restrictions the spread of contagious diseases and concerns over safety health and security aspects of traveling or the fear of any of the foregoing have had and could have in the future a significant adverse impact on demand and pricing in the travel and vacation industry these events could also impact our ability to source qualified crew from throughout the world at competitive costs and therefore increase our shipboard employee costs 

incidents or adverse publicity concerning the cruise vacation industry unusual weather conditions and other natural disasters or disruptions could affect our reputation and harm our future sales and results of operations 

the operation of cruise ships involves the risk of accidents illnesses and other incidents which may bring into question guest safety health security and vacation satisfaction and create a perception that cruising is more dangerous than other vacation alternatives incidents involving cruise ships and in particular our cruise ships adverse media publicity concerning the cruise vacation industry or unusual weather patterns or natural disasters or disruptions such as hurricanes and earthquakes could impact demand for our cruises in addition any events which impact the travel industry more generally may negatively impact our ability to deliver guests to our cruises andor interrupt our ability to obtain services and goods from key vendors in our supply chain any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and on future industry performance 

  

environmental labor health and safety financial responsibility and other maritime regulations could affect operations and increase operating costs 

the united states and various state and foreign government or regulatory agencies have enacted or are considering new environmental regulations or policies such as requiring the use of low sulfur fuels increasing fuel efficiency requirements or further restricting emissions that could increase our cost for fuel and adversely impact the cruise vacation industry see “item 1 business — regulation —environmental regulations” an increase in fuel prices not only impacts our fuel costs but also some of our other expenses such as crew travel freight and commodity prices in addition initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions have been introduced or are being considered in several european countries and beginning in january 2011 the us environmental protection agency began regulating the carbon emissions of companies operating in the united states although not all initiatives are likely to be implemented it is apparent that future legislation and regulations related to climate change could impact the cruise industry and adversely impact our costs some environmental groups have also lobbied for more stringent regulation of cruise ships and have generated negative publicity about the cruise vacation industry and its environmental impact 

with regards to labor we anticipate that the new standards set forth in the maritime labour convention when ratified and effective which we currently believe may occur in 2011 and 2012 respectively will likely result in increased costs associated with our onboard employees see “item 1 business —regulation —labor regulations” while we have been actively seeking ways to mitigate the potential impact on our business there can be no assurances that our efforts will be successful or that our financial results of operations will not be materially impacted 

in addition we are subject to various international national state and local laws regulations and treaties that govern among other things safety standards applicable to our ships treatment of disabled persons health and sanitary standards applicable to our guests security standards on board our ships and at the shipport interface areas and financial responsibilities to our guests these issues are and we believe will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world this could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise ships that would subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 

conducting business internationally may result in increased costs and other risks 

we operate our business internationally and plan to continue to develop our international presence operating internationally exposes us to a number of risks including unstable local economic conditions certain countries have been more severely impacted by the recent economic downturn than other economies around the world where we do business including for example spain where we operate our pullmantur brand other risks attendant to operating internationally include volatile local political conditions potential increases in duties and taxes changes in laws and policies affecting cruising vacation or maritime businesses or governing the operations of foreignbased companies currency fluctuations interest rate movements imposition of trade barriers and restrictions on repatriation of earnings if we are unable to address these risks adequately our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected including the impairment of the value of our ships goodwill and other assets 

operating internationally exposes us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements in many parts of the world including countries in which we operate practices in the local business communities might not conform to international business standards we may not be successful in ensuring that our employees and other representatives stationed throughout the world properly adhere to our policies or applicable laws or regulations failure to adhere to our policies or applicable laws or regulations could result in penalties sanctions damage to our reputation and related costs which in turn could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flow 

we have ship construction contracts which are denominated in euros while we have entered into eurodenominated forward contracts to manage a portion of the currency risk associated with these ship construction contracts we are exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate for the portion of the ship construction contracts that has not been hedged if the shipyard is unable to perform under the related ship construction contract any foreign currency hedges that were entered into to manage the currency risk would need to be terminated termination of these contracts could result in a significant loss 

our attempts to expand our business into new markets may not be successful 

historically our focus has been to serve the north american cruise market which continues to be our primary source of cruise passengers we have expanded our focus to increase our international passenger sourcing most recently in the brazilian asian and australian markets expansion into new markets requires significant levels of investment there can be no assurance that these markets will develop as anticipated or that we will have success in these markets and if we do not we may be unable to recover our investment which could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

ship construction repair or refurbishment delays or mechanical faults may result in cancellation of cruises or unscheduled drydocks and repairs and thus adversely affect our results of operations 

we depend on shipyards to construct and deliver our cruise ships on a timely basis and in good working order the sophisticated nature of building a ship involves risks delays or mechanical faults in ship construction have in the past and may in the future result in delays or cancellation of cruises or necessitate unscheduled drydocks and repairs of ships we have for example experienced mechanical problems with the pod propulsion units on certain ships and there can be no assurance that we will not experience such problems in the future these events and any related adverse publicity could result in lost revenue increased operating expenses or both and thus adversely affect our results of operations 

shipyards and their subcontractors may experience financial difficulties which could cause or result in delay ship cancellations or increases in shipbuilding costs that could adversely affect our results of operations 

we rely on shipyards to construct repair and refurbish our vessels financial difficulties liquidations or closures suffered by these shipyards andor their subcontractors may impact the timely delivery or costs of new ships or the ability of shipyards to repair and refurbish our existing fleet in accordance with our needs or expectations delivery delays and cancelled deliveries can adversely affect our results of operations as can any constraints on our ability to repair and maintain our ships on a timely basis 

our operating costs especially fuel expenditures could increase due to market forces and economic or geo political factors beyond our control 

expenditures for fuel represent a significant cost of operating our business if fuel prices rise significantly in a short period of time we may be unable to increase fares or other fees sufficiently to offset fully our increased fuel costs we routinely hedge a portion of our future fuel requirements to protect against rising fuel costs however there can be no assurance that our hedge contracts will provide a sufficient level of protection against increased fuel costs or that our counterparties will be able to perform under our hedge contracts such as in the case of a counterparty’s bankruptcy further volatility in fuel prices or disruptions in fuel supplies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

our other operating costs including food payroll airfare for our shipboard personnel taxes insurance and security costs are all subject to increases due to market forces and economic or political conditions or other factors beyond our control increases in these operating costs could adversely affect our profitability 

unavailability of ports of call may adversely affect our results of operations  

we believe that port destinations are a major reason why passengers choose to go on a particular cruise or on a cruise vacation the availability of ports is affected by a number of factors including but not limited to existing capacity constraints security concerns adverse weather conditions and natural disasters financial limitations on port development exclusivity arrangements that ports may have with our competitors local governmental regulations and local community concerns about port development and other adverse impacts on their communities from additional tourists any limitations on the availability of our ports of call or on the availability of shore excursion and other service providers at such ports could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

price increases for commercial airline service for our guests or major changes or reduction in commercial airline service could adversely impact the demand for cruises and undermine our ability to provide reasonably priced vacation packages to our guests 

many of our guests depend on scheduled commercial airline services to transport them to or from the ports where our cruises embark or disembark increases in the price of airfare would increase the overall price of the cruise vacation to our guests which may adversely impact demand for our cruises in addition changes in the availability of commercial airline services could adversely affect our guest’s ability to obtain airfare as well as our ability to fly our guests to or from our cruise ships which could adversely affect our results of operations 

our reliance on travel agencies to sell and market our cruises exposes us to certain risks which if realized could adversely impact our business 

because we rely on travel agencies to generate the majority of bookings for our ships we must ensure that our commission rates and incentive structures remain competitive if we fail to offer competitive compensation packages these agencies may be incentivized to sell cruises offered by our competitors to our detriment which could adversely impact our operating results in addition the travel agent industry is sensitive to economic conditions that impact discretionary income significant disruptions or contractions in the industry could reduce the number of travel agencies available for us to market and sell our cruises which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

a disruption in our shoreside business may adversely affect our results of operations 

our principal executive office and shoreside operations are located at the port of miami florida and we have call centers for reservations throughout the world although we have developed disaster recovery and similar contingency plans actual or threatened natural disasters eg hurricanes earthquakes tornados fires floods substantial or repeated information systems failures computer viruses and hackers or similar events in these locations may have a material impact to our business continuity and results of operations further we do not carry business interruption insurance for the majority of our shoreside operations as such any losses or damages incurred by us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

failure to develop the value of our brands and differentiate our products could adversely affect our results of operations 

our success depends on the strength and continued development of our cruise brands and on the effectiveness of our brand strategies failure to protect and differentiate our brands from competitors throughout the vacation market could adversely affect our results of operations 

the loss of key personnel our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel or disruptions among our shipboard personnel due to strained employee relations could adversely affect our results of operations 

our success depends in large part on the skills and contributions of key executives and other employees and on our ability to recruit and retain high quality employees we must continue to recruit retain and motivate management and other employees sufficient to maintain our current business and support our projected growth furthermore as of december 31 2010 80 of our shipboard employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements a dispute under our collective bargaining agreements could result in a work stoppage of those employees covered by the agreements a loss of key employees or disruptions among our shipboard personnel could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

business activities that involve our coinvestment with third parties may subject us to additional risks 

partnerships joint ventures and other business structures involving our coinvestment with third parties such as our joint venture to operate tui cruises generally include some form of shared control over the operations of the business and create additional risks including the possibility that other investors in such ventures could become bankrupt or otherwise lack the financial resources to meet their obligations or could have or develop business interests policies or objectives that are inconsistent with ours in addition actions by another investor may present additional risks of operational difficulties 

we may not realize the intended benefits of our technological investments 

as part of our strategic focus we intend to invest resources into technology that will be complementary to our business technology development can require a significant amount of management time and financial resources and is subject to integration and implementation challenges rapid change short life cycles and obsolescence there can be no assurances that the resources we invest will be sufficient to materially improve the guest experience or customer satisfaction with our company accordingly there can be no assurances that these investments will generate positive returns 

a change in our tax status under the united states internal revenue code or other jurisdictions may have adverse effects on our income  

we and a number of our subsidiaries are foreign corporations that derive income from a united states trade or business andor from sources within the united states drinker biddle  reath llp our united states tax counsel has delivered to us an opinion based on certain representations and assumptions set forth in it to the effect that this income to the extent derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships is exempt from united states federal income tax pursuant to section 883 of the internal revenue code we believe that most of our income including that of our subsidiaries is derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships 

the provisions of section 883 are subject to change at any time by legislation moreover changes could occur in the future with respect to the identity residence or holdings of our direct or indirect shareholders or relevant foreign tax laws that could affect our eligibility for the section 883 exemption accordingly there can be no assurance that we will continue to be exempt from united states income tax on united states source shipping income in the future if we were not entitled to the benefit of section 883 we and our subsidiaries would be subject to united states taxation on a portion of the income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships which would reduce our net income see “item 1 business —taxation of the company” for a discussion of such taxation in the absence of an exemption under section 883 

as part of our growth strategy we have recently expanded our presence within the uk tonnage tax regime and maintained our participation in various other international tonnage tax regimes see “item 1 business —taxation of the company” to the extent the tonnage tax laws change or we do not continue to meet the applicable requirements we may be required to pay higher income tax in these jurisdictions resulting in lower net income 

as budgetary constraints continue to adversely impact the jurisdictions in which we operate increases in income tax regulations affecting our operations may be imposed 

we are controlled by principal shareholders that have the power to determine our policies management and actions requiring shareholder approval 

as of february 14 2011 a wilhelmsen as a norwegian corporation indirectly owned by members of the wilhelmsen family of norway owned approximately 194 of our common stock and cruise associates a bahamian general partnership indirectly owned by various trusts primarily for the benefit of certain members of the pritzker family and a trust primarily for the benefit of certain members of the ofer family owned approximately 154 of our common stock a significant sale of shares by a wilhelmsen as or cruise associates or a perception that either may sell a material amount of shares could cause a drop in our share prices 

  

a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates are parties to a shareholders’ agreement which provides that they will each vote their shares for the election of four nominees of a wilhelmsen as four nominees of cruise associates and our chief executive officer our articles of incorporation require that during the term of the shareholders agreement the approval of at least one director affiliated with a wilhelmsen as and one director affiliated with cruise associates is required for certain corporate actions as such a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates or either of them have the power to determine among other things certain of our policies the persons who will be our officers and actions requiring shareholder approval 

a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates are not prohibited from engaging in a business that may compete with our business subject to certain exceptions if any person other than a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates acquires ownership of more than 30 of our common stock and our two principal shareholders in the aggregate own less of our common stock than such person and do not collectively have the right to elect or to designate for election at least a majority of the board of directors we may be obligated to prepay indebtedness outstanding under the majority of our credit facilities which we may be unable to replace on similar terms if this were to occur it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity and operations 

we are not a united states corporation and our shareholders may be subject to the uncertainties of a foreign legal system in protecting their interests 

our corporate affairs are governed by our restated articles of incorporation and bylaws and by the business corporation act of liberia the provisions of the business corporation act of liberia resemble provisions of the corporation laws of a number of states in the united states however while most states have a fairly well developed body of case law interpreting their respective corporate statutes there are very few judicial cases in liberia interpreting the business corporation act of liberia as such the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under liberian law are not as clearly established as the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in certain united states jurisdictions for example the right of shareholders to bring a derivative action in liberian courts may be more limited than in united states jurisdictions there may also be practical difficulties for shareholders attempting to bring suit in liberia and liberian courts may or may not recognize and enforce foreign judgments thus our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests with respect to actions by management directors or controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a united states jurisdiction 

litigation enforcement actions fines or penalties could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations andor damage our reputation 

our business is subject to various united states and international laws and regulations that could lead to enforcement actions fines civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims and damages in addition improper conduct by our employees or agents could damage our reputation andor lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties including substantial monetary fines in certain circumstances it may not be economical to defend against such matters andor a legal strategy may not ultimately result in us prevailing in a matter such events could lead to an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

provisions of our articles of incorporation bylaws and liberian law could inhibit others from acquiring us prevent a change of control and may prevent efforts by our shareholders to change our management 

certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and liberian law may inhibit third parties from effectuating a change of control of the company without board approval which could result in the entrenchment of current management these include provisions in our articles of incorporation that prevent third parties other than a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates from acquiring beneficial ownership of more than 49 of our outstanding shares without the consent of our board of directors

we also operate two private destinations which we utilize as a portofcall on certain of our itineraries i an island we own in the bahamas which we call cococay and ii labadee a secluded peninsula which we lease and is located on the north coast of haiti 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we commenced an action in june 2010 in the united states district court for puerto rico seeking a declaratory judgment that puerto rico’s distributorship laws do not apply to our relationship with an international representative located in puerto rico in september 2010 that international representative filed a number of counterclaims against royal caribbean cruises ltd and celebrity cruises inc alleging violations of puerto rico’s distributorship laws bad faith breach of contract tortious interference with contract violations of various federal and state antitrust and unfair competition laws the international representative is seeking in excess of 400 million on each of these counterclaims together with treble damages in the amount of 1200 million on several of the counterclaims as well as injunctive relief and declaratory judgment we believe that the claims made against us are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against them 

in september 2010 the united states district court for the western district of washington denied motions seeking permission by the court to rename royal caribbean cruises ltd celebrity cruises inc and other cruise lines as defendants in five actions one of which is a pending class action being brought against park west galleries inc doing business as park west gallery pwg florida inc fine art sales inc vista fine art llc doing business as park west at sea together “park west” and other named and unnamed parties royal caribbean cruises ltd and celebrity cruises inc had previously been dismissed from these actions on the basis that the claims against them were not timely filed andor properly pled the actions are being brought on behalf of purchasers of artwork at shipboard art auctions conducted by park west on the named cruise lines alleging that the artwork park west sells is not what it represents to its customers and that royal caribbean cruises ltd celebrity cruises inc and other named cruise lines are complicit in the activities of park west including engaging in a conspiracy with park west in violation of the racketeer influenced and 

  

corrupt organizations act “rico” and are being enriched unjustly from the sale of the artwork the actions seek refund and restitution of all monies acquired from the sale of artwork at shipboard auctions recovery for the amount of payments for the purchased artwork damages on the rico claims in an indeterminate amount and other permitted statutory damages and equitable relief we will vigorously oppose any attempt by plaintiffs to rename either royal caribbean cruises ltd or celebrity cruises inc as defendants and if we are so renamed we believe we have meritorious defenses to the claims against us which we will vigorously pursue under the current facts and circumstances we no longer consider this matter to be a material proceeding 

commencing in september 2009 and through august 2010 demands for arbitration were made under our collective bargaining agreement covering celebrity cruises’ crewmembers on behalf of twenty nine current andor former celebrity cruises’ cabin stewards and others similarly situated these demands all brought by the same counsel contend that between 2001 and 2005 celebrity cruises improperly required the named cabin stewards to share guest gratuities with assistant cabin stewards the demands seek payment of damages including penalty wages under the us seaman’s wage act of approximately 06 million for the named crewmembers and estimates damages in excess of 2000 million for the entire class of other similarly situated crewmembers in the fourth quarter of 2010 all but five of the demands were dismissed for failure to file the claims timely and the other five are pending determination counsel has brought an action in the united states district court for the southern district of florida seeking to overturn these arbitration awards and is also appealing the dismissal of a similar action brought in october 2009 on behalf of ten crew members and others similarly situated in the united states district court for the southern district of florida making the same contentions and seeking the same damages as the arbitration demands we believe we have meritorious defenses to the pending arbitration demands and actions which we intend to vigorously pursue under the current facts and circumstances we no longer consider this matter to be a material proceeding 

we are routinely involved in other claims typical within the cruise vacation industry the majority of these claims are covered by insurance we believe the outcome of such claims net of expected insurance recoveries will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations

 item 5 market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities 

market information 

our common stock is listed on the new york stock exchange “nyse” and the oslo stock exchange “ose” under the symbol “rcl” the table below sets forth the high and low sales prices of our common stock as reported by the nyse and the ose for the two most recent years by quarter 

 

  

 holders 

as of february 14 2011 there were 1195 record holders of our common stock since certain of our shares are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of shareholders the foregoing number is not representative of the number of beneficial owners 

dividends 

we did not declare cash dividends in 2010 or 2009 commencing in the fourth quarter 2008 our board of directors discontinued the issuance of quarterly dividends 

holders of our common stock have an equal right to share in our profits in the form of dividends when and if declared by our board of directors out of funds legally available therefore holders of our common stock have no rights to any sinking fund 

there are no exchange control restrictions on remittances of dividends on our common stock since 1 we are and intend to maintain our status as a nonresident liberian entity under the revenue code of liberia 2000 and the regulations thereunder and 2 our shipowning subsidiaries are not now engaged and are not in the future expected to engage in any business in liberia including voyages exclusively within the territorial waters of the republic of liberia under current liberian law no liberian taxes or withholding will be imposed on payments to holders of our securities other than to a holder that is a resident liberian entity or a resident individual or an individual or entity subject to taxation in liberia as a result of having a permanent establishment within the meaning of the revenue code of liberia 2000 in liberia 

  

the declaration of dividends shall at all times be subject to the final determination of our board of directors that a dividend is prudent at that time in consideration of the needs of the business the shareholders agreement provides that a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates will from time to time consider our dividend policy with due regard for the interests of the shareholders in maximizing the return on their investment and our ability to pay such dividends the shareholders agreement also provides that payment of dividends will depend among other factors upon our earnings financial position and capital requirements and the income and other tax liabilities of a wilhelmsen as cruise associates and their respective affiliates relating to their ownership of common stock 

performance graph 

the following graph compares the total return assuming reinvestment of dividends on an investment in the company based on performance of the company’s common stock with the performance of the standard  poor’s 500 composite stock index and the dow jones united states travel and leisure index for a five year period by measuring the changes in common stock prices from december 31 2005 to december 31 2010 

 

 the stock performance graph assumes for comparison that the value of the company’s common stock and of each index was 100 on december 31 2005 and that all dividends were reinvested past performance is not necessarily an indicator of future results

overview 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations has been organized to present the following 

 

  

  

  

 critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america see note 1 general and note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  certain of our accounting policies are deemed “critical” as they require management’s highest degree of judgment estimates and assumptions we have discussed these accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors we believe our most critical accounting policies are as follows 

  

ship accounting 

our ships represent our most significant assets and are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation depreciation of ships is generally computed net of a 15 projected residual value using the straightline method over estimated service lives of primarily 30 years our service life and residual value estimates take into consideration the impact of anticipated technological changes longterm cruise and vacation market conditions and historical useful lives of similarlybuilt ships in addition we take into consideration our estimates of the average useful lives of the ships’ major component systems such as hull superstructure main electric engines and cabins given the very large and complex nature of our ships our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain we do not have cost segregation studies performed to specifically componentize our ship systems therefore we estimate the costs of component systems based principally on general and technical information known about major ship component systems and their lives and our knowledge of the cruise vacation industry we do not identify and track depreciation by ship component systems but instead utilize these estimates to determine the net cost basis of assets replaced or refurbished improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized as additions to the ship and depreciated over the improvements’ estimated useful lives the estimated cost and accumulated depreciation of replaced or refurbished ship components are written off and any resulting losses are recognized in cruise operating expenses 

we use the deferral method to account for drydocking costs under the deferral method drydocking costs incurred are deferred and charged to expense on a straightline basis over the period to the next scheduled drydock which we estimate to be a period of thirty to sixty months based on the vessel’s age as required by class deferred drydock costs consist of the costs to drydock the vessel and other costs incurred in connection with the drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessel’s class certification class certification is necessary in order for our cruise ships to be flagged in a specific country obtain liability insurance and legally operate as passenger cruise ships the activities associated with those drydocking costs cannot be performed while the vessel is in service and as such are done during a drydock as a planned major maintenance activity 

the significant deferred drydock costs consist of hauling and wharfage services provided by the drydock facility hull inspection and related activities eg scraping pressure cleaning bottom painting maintenance to steering propulsion stabilizers thruster equipment and ballast tanks port services such as tugs pilotage and line handling and freight associated with these items we perform a detailed analysis of the various activities performed for each drydock and only defer those costs that are directly related to planned major maintenance activities necessary to maintain class the costs deferred are not otherwise routinely periodically performed to maintain a vessel’s designed and intended operating capability repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred 

we use judgment when estimating the period between drydocks which can result in adjustments to the estimated amortization of drydock costs if the vessel is disposed of before the next drydock the remaining balance in deferred drydock is writtenoff to the gain or loss upon disposal of vessel in the period in which the sale takes place we also use judgment when identifying costs incurred during a drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessel’s class certification as compared to those costs attributable to repairs and maintenance which are expensed as incurred see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

we believe we have made reasonable estimates for ship accounting purposes however should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimates of ship service lives or projected residual values depreciation expense could be materially higher or lower if circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making determinations as to whether ship improvements should be capitalized the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance costs could increase partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense if we had reduced our estimated average 30year ship service life by one year depreciation expense for 2010 would have increased by approximately 460 million if our ships were estimated to have no residual value depreciation expense for 2010 would have increased by approximately 1510 million 

  

valuation of longlived assets goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

we review our ships and other longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of these assets based on our estimate of their undiscounted future cash flows if estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of an asset an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the asset’s estimated fair value and its carrying value 

we determine fair value based on quoted market prices in active markets if available if active markets are not available we base fair value on independent appraisals sales price negotiations and projected future cash flows discounted at a rate determined by management to be commensurate with the business risk quoted market prices are often not available for individual reporting units and for indefinitelife intangible assets accordingly we base the fair value of a reporting unit and an indefinitelife intangible asset on an expected present value technique 

we review goodwill trademarks and tradenames which are our most significant indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate but at least annually the impairment review for goodwill consists of a two step process of first determining the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it to the carrying value of the net assets allocated to the reporting unit if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value no further analysis or writedown of goodwill is required if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of its net assets the implied fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all its underlying assets and liabilities including both recognized and unrecognized tangible and intangible assets based on their fair value if necessary goodwill is then written down to its implied fair value the impairment review for indefinitelife intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess if the fair value exceeds its carrying amount the indefinitelife intangible asset is not considered impaired 

we performed our annual impairment review for goodwill during the fourth quarter of 2010 we determined the fair value of our two reporting units which include goodwill royal caribbean international and pullmantur using a probabilityweighted discounted cash flow model the principal assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model are projected operating results weightedaverage cost of capital and terminal value cash flows were calculated using our 2011 projected operating results as a base to that base we added future years’ cash flows assuming multiple revenue and expense scenarios that reflect the impact on each reporting unit of different global economic environments beyond 2011 we assigned a probability to each revenue and expense scenario 

we discounted the projected cash flows using rates specific to each reporting unit based on their respective weightedaverage cost of capital based on the probabilityweighted discounted cash flows of each reporting unit we determined the fair values of royal caribbean international and pullmantur exceeded their carrying values therefore we did not proceed to step two of the impairment analysis and we do not consider goodwill to be impaired royal caribbean international’s reporting unit’s fair value exceeded its carrying value by a significant margin pullmantur’s reporting unit’s fair value exceeded its carrying value by 37 as of december 31 2010 

we also performed the annual impairment review of our trademarks and trade names during the fourth quarter of 2010 using a discounted cash flow model and the relieffromroyalty method the royalty rate used is based on comparable royalty agreements in the tourism and hospitality industry since these trademarks and trade names relate to pullmantur we used the same discount rate used in valuing the pullmantur reporting unit in our goodwill impairment test based on the discounted cash flow model we determined the fair value of our trademarks and trade names exceeded their carrying value by 19 

the estimation of fair value utilizing discounted expected future cash flows includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of expected revenues operating costs marketing selling and administrative expenses interest rates ship additions and retirements as well as assumptions regarding the cruise vacation industry competition and general economic and business conditions among other factors the spanish economy has been 

  

more severely impacted than many other economies around the world where we operate and there is significant uncertainty as to whether or when it will recover if that economy weakens or recovers more slowly than contemplated in our discounted cash flow model that could trigger an impairment charge of pullmantur’s goodwill and trademark and trade names in addition it is reasonably possible that significant changes to our projected operating results utilized in the impairment analyses especially our future net yield assumptions could lead to an impairment of pullmantur’s goodwill and trademark and trade names 

the factors influencing the spanish economy discussed above could also affect the recoverability of pullmantur’s deferred tax assets as of december 31 2010 pullmantur had deferred tax assets of 356 million resulting from net operating losses 

we regularly review deferred tax assets for recoverability based on our history of earnings expectations for future earnings and tax planning strategies we believe it is more likely than not that we will recover the deferred tax assets based on our expectation of future earnings and implementation of tax planning strategies realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income to support the amount of deferred tax assets it is possible we may need to establish a valuation allowance for a portion or all of the deferred tax asset balance if future earnings do not meet expectations or we are unable to successfully implement our tax planning strategies 

derivative instruments 

we enter into forward and swap contracts to manage our interest rate exposure and to limit our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices the majority of these instruments are designated as hedges and are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value we have also entered into fuel call options to limit our exposure to fluctuations in fuel prices these instruments are economic hedges which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes and thus changes in their fair value are immediately recognized in earnings our derivative instruments are not held for trading or speculative purposes we account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with authoritative guidance refer to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies and note 13 fair value measurements and derivative instruments to our consolidated financial statements for more information on related authoritative guidance the company’s hedging programs and derivative financial instruments 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate crosscurrency and fuel swaps with third party institutions in overthecounter markets we estimate the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate and crosscurrency swaps using expected future cash flows based on the instruments’ contract terms and published forward curves for foreign currency exchange and interest rates we apply present value techniques and liborbased discount rates to convert the expected future cash flows to the current fair value of the instruments 

we estimate the fair value of our fuel swaps using expected future cash flows based on the swaps’ contract terms and forward prices we derive forward prices from forward fuel curves based on pricing inputs provided by thirdparty institutions that transact in the fuel indices we hedge we validate these pricing inputs against actual market transactions we apply present value techniques and liborbased discount rates to convert the expected future cash flows to the current fair value of the instruments we also corroborate our fair value estimates using valuations provided by our counterparties 

we determine the fair value for our fuel call options based on the prevailing market price for the instruments consisting of published price quotes for similar assets based on recent transactions in an active market 

we adjust the valuation of our derivative financial instruments to incorporate credit risk when applicable 

we believe it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate crosscurrency and fuel swaps and options would be derived from using other valuation models assumptions inputs or conditions suggested by actual historical experience 

  

contingencies — litigation 

on an ongoing basis we assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss if any can be made in assessing probable losses we take into consideration estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries if any we accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recoveries it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made 

seasonality 

our revenues are seasonal based on demand for cruises demand is strongest for cruises during the northern hemisphere’s summer months and holidays 

financial presentation 

description of certain line items 

revenues 

our revenues are comprised of the following 

 

  

 onboard and other revenues also include revenues we receive from independent third party concessionaires that pay us a percentage of their revenues in exchange for the right to provide selected goods andor services onboard our ships 

expenses 

our cruise operating expenses are comprised of the following 

 

  

  

  

   

  

 we do not allocate payroll and related costs food costs fuel costs or other operating costs to the expense categories attributable to passenger ticket revenues or onboard and other revenues since they are incurred to provide the total cruise vacation experience 

selected operational and financial metrics 

we utilize a variety of operational and financial metrics which are defined below to evaluate our performance and financial condition as discussed in more detail herein certain of these metrics are nongaap financial measures which we believe provide useful information to investors as a supplement to our consolidated financial statements which are prepared and presented in accordance with gaap the presentation of nongaap financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap 

available passenger cruise days “apcd” is our measurement of capacity and represents double occupancy per cabin multiplied by the number of cruise days for the period we use this measure to perform capacity and rate analysis to identify our main noncapacity drivers which cause our cruise revenue and expenses to vary 

gross cruise costs represent the sum of total cruise operating expenses plus marketing selling and administrative expenses 

gross yields represent total revenues per apcd 

net cruise costs represent gross cruise costs excluding commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses each of which is described above under the description of certain line items heading in measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income we believe changes in net cruise costs to be the most relevant indicator of our performance a reconciliation of historical gross cruise costs to net cruise costs is provided below under results of operations  we have not provided a quantitative reconciliation of projected gross cruise costs to projected net cruise costs due to the significant uncertainty in projecting the costs deducted to arrive at this measure accordingly we do not believe that reconciling information for such projected figures would be meaningful 

net debttocapital is a ratio which represents total longterm debt including current portion of longterm debt less cash and cash equivalents “net debt” divided by the sum of net debt and total shareholders’ equity we believe net debt and net debttocapital along with total longterm debt and shareholders’ equity are useful measures of our capital structure a reconciliation of historical debttocapital to net debttocapital is provided below under results of operations 

net revenues represent total revenues less commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses each of which is described under the description of certain line items heading 

net yields represent net revenues per apcd we utilize net revenues and net yields to manage our business on a daytoday basis as we believe that it is the most relevant measure of our pricing performance because it reflects the cruise revenues earned by us net of our most significant variable costs which are commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses a reconciliation of historical gross yields to net yields is provided below under results of operations  we have not provided a quantitative reconciliation of projected gross yields to projected net yields due to the significant uncertainty in projecting the costs deducted to arrive at this measure accordingly we do not believe that reconciling information for such projected figures would be meaningful 

  

occupancy  in accordance with cruise vacation industry practice is calculated by dividing passenger cruise days by apcd a percentage in excess of 100 indicates that three or more passengers occupied some cabins 

passenger cruise days represent the number of passengers carried for the period multiplied by the number of days of their respective cruises 

we believe net yields and net cruise costs are our most relevant nongaap financial measures however a significant portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar because our reporting currency is the united states dollar the value of these revenues and expenses can be affected by changes in currency exchange rates although such changes in local currency prices is just one of many elements impacting our revenues and expenses it can be an important element for this reason we also monitor net yields and net cruise costs as if the current periods’ currency exchange rates had remained constant with the comparable prior periods’ rates or on a “constant currency” basis 

it should be emphasized that constant currency is primarily used for comparing shortterm changes andor projections over the longer term changes in guest sourcing and shifting the amount of purchases between currencies significantly change the impact of the purely currency based fluctuations 

the use of certain significant nongaap measures such as net yields and net cruise costs allow us to perform capacity and rate analysis to separate the impact of known capacity changes from other less predictable changes which affect our business we believe these nongaap measures provide expanded insight to measure revenue and cost performance in addition to the standard united states gaap based financial measures there are no specific rules or regulations for determining nongaap measures and as such there exists the possibility that they may not be comparable to other companies within the industry 

executive overview 

during 2010 we saw a slight improvement in the economy which led to pricing increases as described below although we are not back at prerecession levels the current demand for our brands is improving and we expect this trend to continue through 2011 profitability momentum and yield accretion are also quite strong with our newest vessels performing well and our management team effectively controlling costs during 2010 our net yields increased 42 and our net cruise costs per apcd decreased by 18 despite experiencing travel disruptions extreme weather conditions and currency related issues during the year even though the economy remains a challenge our outlook remains encouraging 

during 2011 we will work to further enhance our revenues with the overall goal of maximizing our return on invested capital we will also continue to improve our cost efficiency through various costcontainment initiatives while ensuring we continue to deliver an outstanding guest experience we note the potential for an increasing role of our tour operations which include royal celebrity tours and pullmantur’s tour businesses and other operations on our net yields and net cruise costs we realize that revenues and expenses associated with such operations tend to be more volatile and less predictable than our main cruise business because the tour businesses have relatively low margins this volatility has little impact on our results of operations but can cause fluctuations in our net yields and net cruise costs 

our international expansion also remains a key focus going into 2011 and we continue to invest in mature markets while strategically focusing on developing markets as a result we are experiencing an increased demand in these markets we also continue to tactically invest in our fleet to ensure we maintain class and brand standards including the addition of new venues and other popular amenities across our fleet in addition we recently reached a conditional agreement with meyer werft to build the first of a new generation of royal caribbean international cruise ships 

lastly we have experienced a significant improvement in our liquidity during 2010 due to the increase in our operating cash flows coupled with the steps we have taken so far to further reduce refinancing risk including obtaining an additional unsecured revolving credit facility in 2010 with the goal of maintaining two separate revolving credit facilities with staggered maturity dates going forward we also have committed bank financing arrangements for our two solsticeclass vessels under construction we anticipate funding our scheduled maturities in 2011 and other obligations through operating cash flows and do not foresee a need to access the capital markets during 2011 although we may opportunistically decide to do so we are also continuing to pursue our longterm objective of returning to investment

summary 

year ended december 31 2010 

total revenues increased 146 to 68 billion in 2010 from total revenues of 59 billion in 2009 primarily due to an 111 increase in capacity measured by apcd for such period and a 42 increase in net yields the increase in net yields was primarily due to increases in ticket prices and occupancy partially offset by the adverse effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates this increase in total revenues was also partially offset by higher operating expenses primarily due to the increase in capacity in part offset by the favorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in addition during 2010 we recorded a onetime gain of approximately 890 million net of costs and payments to insurers related to the settlement of our case against rolls royce as a result our net income was 5475 million or 251 per share on a diluted basis for 2010 compared to 1624 million or 075 per share on a diluted basis for 2009

 outlook 

on january 27 2011 we announced the following guidance for the full year and first quarter of 2011 

full year 2011 

we expected net yields to increase in the range of 4 to 6 compared to 2010 on a constant currency basis we expected net yields to increase in the range of 4 to 5 compared to 2010 

we expected net cruise costs per apcd to increase approximately 2 compared to 2010 on a constant currency basis we expected net cruise costs per apcd to increase in the range of 1 to 2 compared to 2010 excluding fuel we expected net cruise costs per apcd to increase approximately 2 compared to 2010 on a constant currency basis we expected net cruise costs per apcd excluding fuel to increase in the range of 1 to 2 compared to 2010 

we expected a 74 increase in capacity primarily driven by a full year of service of celebrity eclipse  a full year of service of allure of the seas and the addition of celebrity silhouette which will enter service during the third quarter of 2011 

depreciation and amortization expenses were expected to be in the range of 6950 million to 7150 million and interest expense net was expected to be in the range of 3050 million to 3250 million 

we do not forecast fuel prices and our cost calculations for fuel are based on current “atthepump” prices net of any hedging impacts if fuel prices for the full year of 2011 remain at the level of january 27 2011 prices fuel expenses for the full year of 2011 would be approximately 7050 million for the full year of 2011 our fuel expense is approximately 58 hedged and a 10 change in fuel prices would result in a change in our fuel expenses of approximately 280 million for the full year 2011 after taking into account existing hedges 

based on the expectations noted above and assuming that fuel prices remain at 533 per metric ton and full year foreign currency exchange rates are 137 to the euro and 159 to the british pound we expected full year 2011 earnings per share to be in the range of 325 to 345 

  

since our january 27 2011 announcement fuel prices and foreign currency exchange rates have fluctuated significantly and are likely to continue to do so accordingly our forecasts are likely to change with these fluctuations except for the influence of fuel prices and foreign currency exchange rates our outlook remains essentially unchanged 

first quarter 2011 

as announced on january 27 2011 we expected net yields to increase in the range of 2 to 3 compared to 2010 on a constant currency basis we expected net yields to increase in the range of 1 to 2 compared to 2010 

we expected net cruise costs per apcd to increase approximately 1 compared to 2010 we expected net cruise costs per apcd on a constant currency basis to remain consistent with net cruise costs per apcd excluding fuel we expected net cruise costs per apcd to increase approximately 2 compared to 2010 on a constant currency basis we expected net cruise costs per apcd excluding fuel to increase in the range of 1 to 2 compared to 2010 

we expected a 102 increase in capacity primarily driven by the addition of celebrity eclipse which entered service during the second quarter of 2010 and the addition of allure of the seas which entered service during the fourth quarter of 2010 

depreciation and amortization expenses were expected to be in the range of 1700 million to 1750 million and interest expense net was expected to be in the range of 800 million to 850 million 

we do not forecast fuel prices and our cost calculations for fuel are based on current “atthepump” prices net of any hedging impacts if fuel prices for the first quarter of 2011 remain at the level of january 27 2011 prices fuel expenses for the first quarter of 2011 would be approximately 1680 million for the first quarter of 2011 our fuel expense is approximately 63 hedged and a 10 change in fuel prices would result in a change in our fuel expenses of approximately 70 million for the first quarter of 2011 after taking into account existing hedges 

based on the expectations noted above and assuming that fuel prices remain at 515 per metric ton and first quarter foreign currency exchange rates are 137 to the euro and 159 to the british pound we expected first quarter 2011 earnings per share to be in the range of 010 to 015 since our january 27 2011 announcement fuel prices and foreign currency exchange rates have fluctuated significantly and are likely to continue to do so accordingly our forecasts are likely to change with these fluctuations except for the influence of fuel prices and foreign currency exchange rates our outlook remains essentially unchanged

in this section references to 2010 refer to the year ended december 31 2010 and references to 2009 refer to the year ended december 31 2009 

revenues 

total revenues for 2010 increased 8627 million or 146 to 68 billion from 59 billion in 2009 approximately 6541 million of this increase is attributable to an 111 increase in capacity the increase in capacity is primarily due to a full year of service of oasis of the seas  which entered service in december 2009 the addition of celebrity eclipse which entered service in april 2010 a full year of service of celebrity equinox which entered service in july 2009 a full year of service of pacific dream  which entered service in may 2009 and the addition of allure of the seas which entered service in december 2010 this increase in capacity was partially offset by the sale of celebrity galaxy to tui cruises in march 2009 the removal of the atlantic star from operation in august 2009 and the sale of oceanic in april 2009 in addition approximately 2086 million of the increase in total revenues was driven by increases in ticket prices and an increase in occupancy from 1025 in 2009 to 1043 in 2010 the increase in occupancy is primarily due to improving market conditions certain itinerary changes and the favorable impact of our newer ships the increase in occupancy is also due to the absence of the adverse effect caused by the h1n1 virus during the third quarter of 2009 which resulted in selective itinerary modifications and diminished demand for our cruises and tours to mexico these increases were partially offset by a decrease in air revenue due to a reduction in guests booking air service through us and an overall decrease in air ticket prices a decrease in shore excursions revenue on a per passenger basis related to seasonal redeployments and to a decrease in charter revenue due to the termination of the charter to island cruises in april 2009 these increases in revenues were also partially offset by the adverse effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar 

  

onboard and other revenues included concession revenues of 2370 million in 2010 compared to 2156 million for the same period in 2009 the increase in concession revenues was primarily due to the increase in capacity mentioned above 

cruise operating expenses 

total cruise operating expenses for 2010 increased 3870 million or 95 to 45 billion from 41 billion for 2009 approximately 4521 million of this increase is attributable to the 111 increase in capacity mentioned above the increase is also due to an increase in commissions directly related to the increase in ticket prices these increases were partially offset by a 302 million decrease primarily attributable to lower air expenses shore excursions expenses and fuel expenses on a per passenger basis and to a lesser extent our continued emphasis on costcontainment the decreases in air expenses and shore excursion expenses are directly related to the decreases in revenue as mentioned above the decrease in fuel expenses was primarily a result of improved fuel efficiencies related to our newer ships and the favorable effect of fuel swap agreements despite increasing fuel prices the increase in cruise operating expenses was also partially offset an estimated 349 million decrease related to the favorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our cruise operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar 

marketing selling and administrative expenses 

marketing selling and administrative expenses for 2010 increased 861 million or 113 to 8481 million from 7620 million for 2009 the increase is primarily due to an increase in shoreside payroll and benefits due to higher headcount primarily related to our continued international expansion and general increases in compensation 

depreciation and amortization expenses 

depreciation and amortization expenses for 2010 increased 755 million or 133 to 6437 million from 5682 million for 2009 the increase is primarily due to the addition of oasis of the seas  the addition of celebrity eclipse and a full year of service of celebrity equinox  these increases were partially offset by the sale of celebrity galaxy to tui cruises the classification of the atlantic star as held for sale which accordingly is no longer being depreciated and the sale of oceanic  

other income expense 

interest expense net of interest capitalized increased to 3394 million in 2010 from 3000 million in 2009 gross interest expense increased to 3654 million in 2010 from 3411 million in 2009 the increase was primarily due to a higher average debt level partially offset by lower interest rates interest capitalized decreased to 260 million in 2010 from 411 million in 2009 primarily due to a lower average level of investment in ships under construction and to a lesser extent lower interest rates 

other income was 750 million in 2010 compared to other expense of 331 million in 2009 for a net change of 1081 million when comparing these periods the increase was primarily due to an 890 million gain net of costs and payments to insurers recorded from the settlement with rolls royce 

net yields 

net yields increased 42 in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to the increase in ticket prices and the increase in occupancy as discussed above net yields on a constant currency basis remained consistent with net yields 

net cruise costs 

net cruise costs increased 91 in 2010 compared to 2009 due to the 111 increase in capacity partially offset by a 18 decrease in net cruise cost per apcd the decrease in net cruise costs per apcd was primarily driven by the 

  

decrease in fuel expenses our continued emphasis on costcontainment and by the absence in 2010 of a 71 million loss recognized during the third quarter of 2009 to reduce the carrying value of the atlantic star to its fair value less cost to sell when the ship was classified as held for sale net cruise costs per apcd on a constant currency remained consistent with net cruise costs per apcd

in this section references to 2009 refer to the year ended december 31 2009 and references to 2008 refer to the year ended december 31 2008 

revenues 

total revenues for 2009 decreased 6427 million or 98 to 59 billion from 65 billion in 2008 this decrease is primarily due to higher discounts on our ticket prices and to a lesser extent a decrease in onboard spending and the adverse effect of foreign currency as a result of a stronger united states dollar against the euro british pound and canadian dollar compared to 2008 our revenues were also adversely impacted by a decrease in occupancy from 1045 in 2008 compared to 1025 in 2009 the decrease in occupancy was driven by the current worldwide economic environment with disproportionate pressure within the spanish market in addition the adverse impact of the h1n1 virus resulted in selective itinerary modifications and diminished demand for our cruises to mexico and the caribbean this revenue decrease was partially offset by an estimated increase of approximately 3350 million attributable to an increase in capacity of 51 although the number of passengers carried in 2009 decreased as compared to 2008 on average passengers sailed more days per voyage in 2009 as compared to 2008 due to certain itinerary changes the increase in capacity is primarily due to a full year of service of celebrity solstice  which entered service in november 2008 a full year of service of independence of the seas  which entered service in may 2008 the addition of celebrity equinox  which entered service in july 2009 the addition of pacific dream which entered service in may 2009 as part of the termination of the charter to island cruises a full year of service of ocean dream which entered service in march 2008 and the addition of oasis of the seas  which entered service in december 2009 this increase in capacity was partially offset by the sale of celebrity galaxy to tui cruises in march 2009 the sale of oceanic in april 2009 and the atlantic star which is no longer in operation 

onboard and other revenues included concession revenues of 2156 million in 2009 compared to 2308 million for the same period in 2008 the decrease in concession revenues was primarily due to a decrease in spending on a per passenger basis partially offset by the increase in capacity mentioned above 

cruise operating expenses 

total cruise operating expenses for 2009 decreased 3326 million or 76 to 41 billion from 44 billion for 2008 this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in commissions as a result of discounted ticket prices a decrease in air expense due to a reduction in guests booking air service through us a decrease in transportation and lodging expenses related to certain itinerary changes and the impact of the stronger united states dollar against the euro british pound and canadian dollar compared to 2008 in addition fuel expenses which are net of the financial impact of fuel swap agreements decreased 179 per metric ton in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily as a result of lower fuel prices to a lesser extent the decrease was also related to a decrease in tour and air expenses these decreases were partially offset by the increase in capacity mentioned above 

marketing selling and administrative expenses 

marketing selling and administrative expenses for 2009 decreased 145 million or 19 to 7620 million from 7765 million for 2008 the decrease is mainly due to the impact of our costcontainment initiatives and to termination benefits of 90 million incurred during 2008 that did not recur in 2009 the decrease was partially offset by an increase in marketing and selling expenses associated with our international expansion 

  

depreciation and amortization expenses 

depreciation and amortization expenses for 2009 increased 478 million or 92 to 5682 million from 5204 million for 2008 the increase is primarily due to a full year of service of celebrity solstice a full year of service of independence of the seas and the addition of celebrity equinox  to a lesser extent the increase is also due to depreciation associated with shipboard and shoreside additions these increases were partially offset by the sale of celebrity galaxy to tui cruises 

other income expense 

interest expense net of interest capitalized decreased to 3000 million in 2009 from 3273 million in 2008 gross interest expense decreased to 3411 million in 2009 from 3717 million in 2008 the decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates partially offset by a higher average debt level interest capitalized decreased to 411 million in 2009 from 444 million in 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates 

other expense increased to 331 million in 2009 compared to other income of 549 million in 2008 for a net change of 880 million when comparing these periods the change was primarily due to 211 million in foreign currency exchange losses in 2009 as compared to 230 million in foreign currency exchange gains in 2008 for a net change of 441 million when comparing these periods this change was primarily due to the dramatic movements in exchange rates during the latter half of 2008 and most of 2009 in addition we had 152 million in losses from our equity method investments in 2009 as compared to 40 million in gains from our equity method investments in 2008 for a net change of 192 million when comparing these periods this change was primarily due to the startup of operations of one of our investments the change in other income expense was also due to a 176 million settlement gain received in the case against pentair water treatment oh company formerly known as essef corporation during 2008 that did not recur in 2009 these changes were offset by an out of period adjustment recorded in 2009 of 123 million to correct an error in our deferred tax liability the out of period adjustment represents the cumulative reduction to a deferred tax liability due to the change in the enacted spanish statutory tax rate used to calculate the liability in 2006 which was identified during the third quarter of 2009 

net yields 

net yields decreased 142 in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to the higher discounts on our ticket prices the decrease in onboard spending a stronger united states dollar compared to the euro british pound and canadian dollar as well as the impact of the itinerary modifications and diminished demand for our cruises and tours to mexico and the caribbean as mentioned above 

net cruise costs 

net cruise costs decreased 52 in 2009 compared to 2008 due to a 98 decrease in net cruise cost per apcd offset by the 51 increase in capacity mentioned above the decrease in net cruise costs per apcd was primarily driven by the decrease in fuel expenses the decrease in air and tour expenses and the decrease in marketing selling and administrative expenses

liquidity and capital resources 

sources and uses of cash 

cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity net cash provided by operating activities increased 8181 million to 17 billion for 2010 compared to 8449 million for 2009 the increase is primarily due to an increase in cash generated from ticket sales the increase in cash from ticket sales is a result of higher capacity and occupancy along with cruises being purchased for higher prices as a result of the above factors we received 8115 million more in customer deposits during 2010 as compared to 2009 the increase is also due to the monetization of certain 

  

of our interest rate cross currency and fuel swap agreements during 2010 of approximately 1730 million the monetization of the interest rate and cross currency swap agreements was done in an effort to increase our fixed rate percentage of debt the monetization of our fuel swaps was done in connection with our decision to terminate transactions with a counterparty that no longer met our guidelines these increases were partially offset by the timing of payments on our accounts payable and prepaid expenses and other assets 

net cash used in investing activities was 23 billion for 2010 consistent with 2009 during 2010 our use of cash was primarily related to capital expenditures of 22 billion down from 25 billion in 2009 the decrease in capital expenditures during 2010 is due to a lower level of ships under construction compared to 2009 in 2009 we also used 1817 million of cash to make equity contributions to our unconsolidated affiliates these amounts were partially offset by 2909 million of proceeds received from the sale of celebrity galaxy to tui cruises in 2009 and to 1108 million of cash received in 2009 on settlements on our foreign currency forward contracts compared to 913 million of cash paid in 2010 on settlements on our foreign currency forward contracts 

net cash provided by financing activities was 7570 million for 2010 compared to 13 billion in 2009 this change was due to an increase in repayments of debt of approximately 6518 million partially offset by an increase in debt proceeds of approximately 1031 million the increase in repayments of debt was primarily due to repayments of 8200 million on our revolving credit facilities during 2010 as compared to 3750 million in 2009 in addition during 2010 we repaid a senior unsecured note due in may 2010 along with repayments of various loan facilities related to recent ship deliveries the increase in debt proceeds was due to borrowings of 7150 million on our revolving credit facilities during 2010 as compared to 4250 million in 2009 this increase was partially offset by net proceeds of 2854 million from our 3000 million senior unsecured notes issued during 2009 which did not recur in 2010 these increases were offset by a 296 million increase in debt issuance costs during 2010 we received 262 million in connection with the exercise of common stock options 

future capital commitments 

our future capital commitments consist primarily of new ship orders as of december 31 2010 we had two solsticeclass ships designated for celebrity cruises  on order for an aggregate additional capacity of approximately 5850 berths the aggregate cost of the two ships including amounts due to the shipyard and other ship related costs is approximately 18 billion of which we have deposited 1993 million as of december 31 2010 approximately 22 of the aggregate cost of the ships on order was exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate at december 31 2010 see note 13 fair value measurements and derivative instruments and note 14 commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  as of december 31 2010 we anticipated overall capital expenditures including the two ships on order will be approximately 10 billion for 2011 10 billion for 2012 and 3500 million for 2013 

in february 2011 we reached a conditional agreement with meyer werft to build the first of a new generation of royal caribbean international cruise ships the ship will have a capacity of approximately 4100 berths based on double occupancy and is expected to enter service in the fourth quarter of 2014 the agreement will become definitive upon satisfaction of several conditions including financing we also have an option to construct a second ship of the same class which will expire on february 28 2012 subject to earlier acceleration under certain circumstances including the conditional agreement for the first ship our anticipated overall capital expenditures will be approximately 10 billion for 2011 10 billion for 2012 3500 million for 2013 and 11 billion for 2014 

  

contractual obligations 

as of december 31 2010 our contractual obligations were as follows in thousands 

 

  

       as a normal part of our business depending on market conditions pricing and our overall growth strategy we continuously consider opportunities to enter into contracts for the building of additional ships we may also consider the sale of ships or the purchase of existing ships we continuously consider potential acquisitions and strategic alliances if any of these were to occur they would be financed through the incurrence of additional indebtedness the issuance of additional shares of equity securities or through cash flows from operations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

under the brilliance of the seas operating lease we have agreed to indemnify the lessor to the extent its aftertax return is negatively impacted by unfavorable changes in corporate tax rates capital allowance deductions and certain unfavorable determinations which may be made by united kingdom tax authorities these indemnifications could result in an increase in our lease payments we are unable to estimate the maximum potential increase in our lease payments due to the various circumstances timing or a combination of events that could trigger such indemnifications we have been advised by the lessor that the united kingdom tax authorities are disputing the lessor’s accounting treatment of the lease and that the parties are in discussions on the matter if the characterization of the lease is ultimately determined to be incorrect we could be required to indemnify the lessor under certain circumstances the lessor has advised us that they believe their characterization of the lease is correct based on the foregoing and our review of available information we do not believe an indemnification is probable however if the lessor loses its dispute and we are required to indemnify the lessor we cannot at this time predict the impact that such an occurrence would have on our financial condition and results of operations 

some of the contracts that we enter into include indemnification provisions that obligate us to make payments to the counterparty if certain events occur these contingencies generally relate to changes in taxes increased lender capital costs and other similar costs the indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms and are entered into in the normal course of business there are no stated or notional amounts included in the indemnification clauses and we are not able to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments if any under these indemnification clauses we have not been required to make any payments under such indemnification clauses in the past and under current circumstances we do not believe an indemnification obligation is probable 

  

other than the items described above we are not party to any other offbalance sheet arrangements including guarantee contracts retained or contingent interest certain derivative instruments and variable interest entities that either have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial position 

funding sources 

we have significant contractual obligations of which the capital expenditures associated with our ship purchases and our debt maturities represent our largest funding needs we have 25 billion in contractual obligations due in 2011 of which 7251 million relates to the acquisition of the celebrity silhouette along with progress payments on celebrity reflection and 12 billion relates to debt maturities in addition we have 108 billion in contractual obligations due beyond 2011 of which debt maturities and ship purchase obligations represent 79 billion and 7036 million respectively we have historically relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations drawdowns under our available credit facilities and the incurrence of additional debt to fund these obligations 

as of december 31 2010 our liquidity was 16 billion consisting of 4199 million in cash and cash equivalents and 12 billion available under our unsecured revolving credit facilities in addition we had a working capital deficit of 24 billion as of december 31 2010 as compared to our working capital deficit of 17 billion as of december 31 2009 similar to others in our industry we are able to operate with a substantial working capital deficit because 1 passenger receipts are primarily paid in advance with a relatively lowlevel of accounts receivable 2 rapid turnover results in a limited investment in inventories and 3 voyagerelated accounts payable usually become due after receipt of cash from related bookings in addition we finance the purchase of our ships through longterm debt instruments of which the current portion of these instruments increases our working capital deficit the current portion of longterm debt increased from 7562 million as of december 31 2009 to 12 billion as of december 31 2010 we generate substantial cash flows from operations and our business model along with our unsecured revolving credit facilities have historically allowed us to maintain this working capital deficit and still meet our operating investing and financing needs we expect that we will continue to have working capital deficits in the future 

we have two solsticeclass vessels under construction in germany both of which have committed bank financing arrangements which include sovereign financing guarantees 

we continue our focus on ensuring adequate cash and liquidity we are committed to improving our cost focus and continue to implement cost containment initiatives to improve liquidity we entered into a second unsecured revolving credit facility during 2010 that provides us up to 5250 million in available borrowings we anticipate that our cash flows from operations our current available credit facilities and our current financing arrangements will be adequate to meet our capital expenditures and debt repayments over the next twelvemonth period in addition we may elect to fund our contractual obligations through other means if favorable opportunities arise 

if any person other than a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates our two principal shareholders acquires ownership of more than 30 of our common stock and our two principal shareholders in the aggregate own less of our common stock than such person and do not collectively have the right to elect or to designate for election at least a majority of the board of directors we may be obligated to prepay indebtedness outstanding under the majority of our credit facilities which we may be unable to replace on similar terms if this were to occur it would have an adverse impact on our liquidity and operations 

  

debt covenants 

our financing agreements contain covenants that require us among other things to maintain minimum net worth of at least 54 billion a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 125x and limit our net debttocapital ratio to no more than 625 the fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated by dividing net cash from operations for the past four quarters by the sum of dividend payments plus scheduled principal debt payments in excess of any new financings for the past four quarters our minimum net worth and maximum net debttocapital calculations exclude the impact of accumulated other comprehensive income loss on total shareholders’ equity we are currently well in excess of all debt covenant requirements the specific covenants and related definitions can be found in the applicable debt agreements the majority of which have been previously filed with the securities and exchange commission 

dividends 

during the first three quarters of 2008 we paid out dividends totaling 1280 million commencing in the fourth quarter 2008 our board of directors discontinued the issuance of quarterly dividends as a result we did not declare cash dividends in 2010 or 2009 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial instruments and other 

general 

we are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices we manage these risks through a combination of our normal operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments pursuant to our hedging policies and procedures the financial impacts of these hedging instruments are primarily offset by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures being hedged we achieve this by closely matching the amount term and conditions of the derivative instrument with the underlying risk being hedged we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes we monitor our derivative positions using techniques including market valuations and sensitivity analyses see note 13 fair value measurements and derivative instruments to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our longterm debt obligations and our operating lease for brilliance of the seas  at december 31 2010 approximately 49 of our longterm debt was effectively fixed and approximately 51 was floating we enter into interest rate swap agreements to modify our exposure to interest rate movements and to manage our interest expense and rent expense 

market risk associated with our longterm fixed rate debt is the potential increase in fair value resulting from a decrease in interest rates we use interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a portion of our fixedrate debt to a floatingrate basis to manage this risk in an effort to increase our percentage of fixed rate debt during 2010 we terminated our interest rate swap agreements that effectively changed €10 billion of debt with a fixed rate of 5625 to euriborbased floating rate debt we also terminated our cross currency swap agreements that effectively changed €3000 million of the €10 billion floating euriborbased debt to 3891 million of floating liborbased debt upon termination of these swaps we received net cash proceeds of approximately 1154 million at december 31 2010 we maintained interest rate swap agreements that effectively changed 3500 million of debt with a fixed rate of 725 to liborbased floating rate debt plus a margin of 172 currently approximately 218 

the estimated fair value of our longterm fixed rate debt at december 31 2010 was 49 billion using quoted market prices where available or using the present value of expected future cash flows which incorporates risk profile the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements including accrued interest was estimated to be an asset of 573 million as of december 31 2010 based on the present value of expected future cash flows a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates at december 31 2010 would increase the fair value of our longterm fixed rate debt by approximately 1877 million net of an increase in the fair value of the associated interest rate swap agreements 

market risk associated with our longterm floating rate debt is the potential increase in interest expense from an increase in interest rates a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase our 2011 interest expense by approximately 379 million assuming no change in exchange rates 

market risk associated with our operating lease for brilliance of the seas is the potential increase in rent expense from an increase in sterling libor rates we have effectively changed 49 of the operating lease obligation from a floating rate to a fixed rate obligation with a weightedaverage rate of 476 through rate fixings with the lessor a hypothetical one percentage point increase in sterling libor rates would increase our 2011 rent expense by approximately 15 million based on the exchange rate at december 31 2010 

  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to our ship construction firm commitments denominated in euros and a portion of our eurodenominated debt we enter into eurodenominated forward contracts and cross currency swap agreements to manage this risk the estimated fair value of such eurodenominated forward contracts at december 31 2010 was estimated to be a liability of 799 million based on the present value of expected future cash flows at december 31 2010 approximately 22 of the aggregate cost of the ships on order was exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate a hypothetical 10 strengthening of the euro as of december 31 2010 assuming no changes in comparative interest rates would result in a 41 million increase in the united states dollar cost of the foreign currency denominated ship construction contracts exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate 

during 2010 we entered into cross currency swap agreements that effectively changed €4000 million of the €10 billion debt with a fixed rate of 5625 to 5090 million of debt at a weightedaverage fixed rate of 6625 the estimated fair value of these cross currency swap agreements including accrued interest at december 31 2010 was an asset of approximately 166 million based on the present value of expected future cash flows a hypothetical 10 strengthening of the euro as of december 31 2010 assuming no changes in comparative interest rates would result in an increase in the fair value of the €4000 million of fixed rate debt by 466 million offset by an increase in the fair value of the cross currency swap agreements of 469 million 

also we consider our investments in foreign operations to be denominated in relatively stable currencies and of a longterm nature we partially address the exposure of our investments in foreign operations by denominating a portion of our debt in our subsidiaries’ and investments’ functional currencies specifically we have assigned debt of approximately €4693 million or approximately 6282 million as a hedge of our net investment in foreign operations accordingly we have included approximately 123 million of foreigncurrency transaction losses in the foreign currency translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss at december 31 2010 a hypothetical 10 increase or decrease in the december 31 2010 foreign currency exchange rate would increase or decrease the fair value of our assigned debt by 513 million which would be offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the united states dollar value of our net investment 

our growing international business operations also subject us to an increasing level of foreign currency exchange risk movements in foreign currency exchange rates may affect the translated value of our earnings and cash flows associated with our international operations 

fuel price risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates to the consumption of fuel on our ships fuel cost net of the financial impact of fuel swap agreements as a percentage of our total revenues was approximately 96 in 2010 102 in 2009 and 111 in 2008 we use a range of instruments including fuel swap agreements and fuel call options to mitigate the financial impact of fluctuations in fuel prices during the second quarter of 2010 we terminated 229 of our fuel swap agreements as of june 30 2010 due to a counterparty no longer meeting our guidelines and entered into new fuel swap agreements with a different counterparty upon termination of the fuel swaps we received net cash proceeds of approximately 575 million 

as of december 31 2010 we had fuel swap agreements to pay fixed prices for fuel with an aggregate notional amount of approximately 8975 million maturing through 2013 the fuel swap agreements represent 58 of our projected 2011 fuel requirements 55 of our projected 2012 fuel requirements and 22 of our projected 2013 fuel requirements the estimated fair value of these contracts at december 31 2010 was estimated to be an asset of 862 million as of december 31 2010 we purchased fuel call options on a total of 66 million barrels which mature between 2011 and 2013 the fuel call options represent 41 of our projected 2011 fuel requirements 25 of our projected 2012 fuel requirements and 11 of our projected 2013 fuel requirements the estimated fair value of these contracts at december 31 2010 was an asset of approximately 317 million we estimate that a hypothetical 10 increase in our weightedaverage fuel price from that experienced during the year ended december 31 2010 would increase our 2011 fuel cost by approximately 280 million net of the impact of fuel swap agreements and fuel call options

industry 

cruising is considered a well established vacation sector in the north american market and a developing but growing sector in several other emerging markets industry data indicates that a significant portion of cruise guests carried are firsttime cruisers we believe this could present an opportunity for longterm growth and a potential for increased profitability 

we estimate that the global cruise industry carried 173 million cruise passengers in 2009 compared to 172 million cruise passengers carried in 2008 we estimate that the global cruise fleet was served by approximately 373000 berths on approximately 267 ships by the end of 2009 there are approximately 27 ships with an estimated 62000 berths that are expected to be placed in service in the global cruise market between 2010 and 2013 

the north american cruise market has experienced a compound annual growth rate of approximately 83 since 1970 from 2005 to 2009 north america has experienced a compound annual growth rate in cruise passengers of approximately 06 attributable in large part to the recent international expansion within the cruise industry we estimate that north america was served by 138 ships with approximately 188000 berths at the beginning of 2005 and by 145 ships with approximately 228000 berths by the end of 2009 there are approximately 14 ships with an estimated 33000 berths that are expected to be placed in service in the north american cruise market between 2010 and 2013 

  

the following table details the growth in the global and north american cruise markets in terms of cruise passengers and estimated weightedaverage berths over the past five years 

 

  

  we compete with a number of cruise lines however our principal competitors are carnival corporation  plc which owns among others aida cruises carnival cruise lines costa cruises cunard line holland america line iberocruceros po cruises and princess cruises disney cruise line msc cruises norwegian cruise line and oceania cruises cruise lines compete with other vacation alternatives such as landbased resort hotels and sightseeing destinations for consumers’ leisure time demand for such activities is influenced by political and general economic conditions companies within the vacation market are dependent on consumer discretionary spending 

our ships operate worldwide and have itineraries that call on destinations in alaska asia australia the bahamas bermuda california canada the caribbean europe the galapagos islands hawaii mexico the middle east new england new zealand the panama canal and south america 

in an effort to penetrate untapped markets and diversify our customer base we continue to seek opportunities to redeploy ships in our royal caribbean international celebrity cruises and azamara club cruises brands to new markets and itineraries throughout the world the portability of our ships and our investment in infrastructure allows us to expand into new markets and helps us reduce our dependency on any one market by allowing us to create “home ports” around the world in addition it allows us to readily redeploy our ships to meet demand within our existing cruise markets 

the current economic environment has significantly deteriorated consumer confidence and discretionary spending while there has been a decrease in the demand for cruises and a resulting drop in cruise prices cruising has proven to be resilient as it offers consumers a good value when compared to other vacation alternatives however the projected increase in capacity within the cruise industry from new cruise ships currently on order could produce additional pricing pressures within the industry see item 1a  risk factors

insurance 

we maintain insurance on the hull and machinery of our ships which includes additional coverage for disbursements earnings and increased value which are maintained in amounts related to the value of each ship the coverage for each of the hull policies is maintained with syndicates of insurance underwriters from the british scandinavian french united states and other international insurance markets 

we maintain liability protection and indemnity insurance for each of our ships through either the united kingdom mutual steam ship assurance association bermuda limited or steamship mutual underwriting association bermuda limited our protection and indemnity liability insurance is done on a mutual basis and we are subject to additional premium calls in amounts based on claim records of all members of the mutual protection and indemnity association we are also subject to additional premium calls based on investment shortfalls experienced by the insurer 

we maintain war risk insurance for our ships including terrorist risk insurance on each ship through a norwegian war risk insurance organization this coverage includes coverage for physical damage to the ship which is not covered under the hull policies as a result of war exclusion clauses in such hull policies we also maintain protection and indemnity war risk coverage for risks that would be excluded by the rules of the indemnity insurance organizations subject to certain limitations consistent with most marine war risk policies under the terms of our war risk insurance coverage underwriters can give seven days notice to us that the policy will be canceled and reinstated at higher premium rates 

  

we also maintain insurance coverage for certain events which would result in a delayed delivery of our contracted new ships which we normally place starting approximately two years prior to the scheduled delivery dates 

insurance coverage for shoreside property shipboard inventory and general liability risks are maintained with insurance underwriters in the united states and the united kingdom 

we do not carry business interruption insurance for our ships based on our evaluation of the risks involved and protective measures already in place as compared to the cost of insurance we carry business interruption insurance for certain of our shoreside operations 

all insurance coverage is subject to certain limitations exclusions and deductible levels in addition in certain circumstances we coinsure a portion of these risks premiums charged by insurance carriers including carriers in the maritime insurance industry increase or decrease from time to time and tend to be cyclical in nature these cycles are impacted both by our own loss experience and by losses incurred in direct and reinsurance markets we historically have been able to obtain insurance coverage in amounts and at premiums we have deemed to be commercially acceptable no assurance can be given that affordable and secure insurance markets will be available to us in the future particularly for war risk insurance 

the athens convention relating to the carriage of passengers and their luggage by sea 1974 and the 1976 protocol to the athens convention are generally applicable to passenger ships the united states has not ratified the athens convention however with limited exceptions the 1976 athens convention protocol may be contractually enforced with respect to those of our cruises that do not call at a united states port the international maritime organization diplomatic conference agreed upon a new protocol to the athens convention on november 1 2002 the 2002 protocol which is not yet in force substantially increases the level of compulsory insurance which must be maintained by passenger ship operators no assurance can be given as to if or when the 2002 protocol will come into force if in force no assurance can be given that affordable and secure insurance markets will be available to provide the level of coverage required under the 2002 protocol 

trademarks 

we own a number of registered trademarks related to the royal caribbean international celebrity cruises pullmantur and cdf croisières de france cruise brands the registered trademarks include the name “royal caribbean” and its crown and anchor logo the name “celebrity cruises” and its “x” logo the names “pullmantur cruises” and “pullmantur” and their logos the name “cdf croisières de france” and its logo and the names of various cruise ships we have also filed an application to register trademarks related to azamara club cruises which include the name “azamara club cruises” and its logo we believe trademarks related to the royal caribbean international celebrity cruises and pullmantur cruises brands are widely recognized throughout the world and have considerable value we also believe trademarks related to our new brands azamara club cruises and cdf croisières de france have received recent recognition throughout the world and have significant value 

regulation 

our ships are regulated by various international national state and local laws regulations and treaties in force in the jurisdictions in which they operate in addition our ships are registered in the bahamas malta or in the case of celebrity xpedition  ecuador each ship is subject to regulations issued by its country of registry including regulations issued pursuant to international treaties governing the safety of our ships guests and crew as well as environmental protection each country of registry conducts periodic inspections to verify compliance with these regulations as discussed more fully below ships operating out of united states ports are subject to inspection by the united states coast guard for compliance with international treaties and by the united states public health service for sanitary conditions our ships are also subject to similar inspections pursuant to the laws and regulations of various other countries our ships visit 

we believe that we are in material compliance with all the regulations applicable to our ships and that we have all licenses necessary to conduct our business health safety security environmental and financial responsibility issues are and we believe will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant government authorities in the united states and internationally from time to time various regulatory and legislative changes may be proposed that could impact our operations and would likely subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 

  

safety regulations 

our ships are required to comply with international safety standards defined in the international convention for safety of life at sea “solas” which among other things establishes requirements for ship design structural features materials construction life saving equipment and safe management and operation of ships to ensure guest and crew safety the solas standards are revised from time to time and the most recent modifications are being phased in through 2010 we do not anticipate that we will be required to make any material expenditures in order to comply with these rules 

security regulations 

our ships are subject to various security requirements including the international ship and port facility security code “isps code” which is part of solas and the us maritime transportation security act of 2002 “mtsa” which is the governing regulation for ships that operate in us ports in order to satisfy these security requirements we implement security measures conduct vessel security assessments and develop security plans the security plans for all of our ships have been submitted to and approved by the respective countries of registry for our ships in compliance with the isps code and the mtsa 

environmental regulations 

we are subject to various united states and international laws and regulations relating to environmental protection under such laws and regulations we are prohibited from among other things discharging certain materials such as petrochemicals and plastics into the waterways we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations from time to time environmental and other regulators consider more stringent regulations which may affect our operations and increase our compliance costs we believe that the impact of cruise ships on the global environment will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world and accordingly this will likely subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 

our ships are subject to the international maritime organization’s “imo” regulations under the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships the “marpol regulations” which includes requirements designed to prevent and minimize pollution by oil sewage garbage and air emissions we have obtained the relevant international compliance certificates relating to oil sewage and air pollution prevention for all of our ships 

on january 1 2010 a european union directive regarding the use of low sulfur fuels for ships became effective the directive places a 01 sulfur content limit on all marine fuels used by such ships while berthed or anchored in european union ports compliance with this directive will require us to use distillate fuels such as marine gas oil which we do not expect will have a material effect on our fuel and operating costs 

the marpol regulations impose global limitations on the sulfur content of fuel used by ships operating worldwide which are currently 45 and are required to be reduced to 35 by january 1 2012 we do not expect that this required reduction will have a material effect on our fuel and operating costs these regulations will also require the worldwide limitations on sulfur content of fuel to be reduced to 05 by january 1 2020 subject to a feasibility review to be completed by imo no later than 2018 if such a reduced limitation is implemented worldwide in 2020 our fuel costs could increase significantly 

the marpol regulations also establish special emission control areas “ecas” with stringent limitations on sulfur and nitrogen oxide emissions in these areas which currently include the baltic sea and the north seaenglish channel ships operating in ecas will have to reduce their fuel sulfur content from 15 to 10 beginning on july 1 2010 moreover the united states and canada have applied to the imo to designate waters within 200 nautical miles of their east west and gulf coasts as well as the hawaiian islands as an eca but excluding certain areas within the caribbean basin such as the bahamas if approved this eca would likely come into effect during the summer of 2012 we do not expect the required sulfur content reductions in either the existing ecas or in the proposed united states and canadian eca will have a material effect on our fuel and operating costs however ships operating in ecas will have to reduce their fuel sulfur content further to 01 beginning on january 1 2015 we estimate that the implementation of this change in the existing ecas and in the proposed us and canadian eca could significantly increase our costs after january 1 2015 based on current capacities fuel prices itineraries and technologies 

  

the cost impacts from implementing progressively lower sulfur content requirements after january 1 2015 are not reasonably determinable given the length of time until such possible implementation and the applicability of many possible mitigating factors such as changes in the future supply and demand for fuel the development of emissions abatement technologies including new engine designs or exhaust gas treatment systems and new fuel conservation initiatives 

we are required to obtain certificates from the united states coast guard relating to our ability to satisfy liability in cases of water pollution pursuant to united states coast guard regulations we arrange through our insurers for the provision of guarantees aggregating 3472 million as a condition to obtaining the required certificates 

labor regulations 

the international labour organization an agency of the united nations that develops worldwide employment standards has adopted a new consolidated maritime labour convention the “convention” the convention reflects standards and conditions to govern all aspects of crew management for all ships in international commerce including additional requirements relating to the health safety and status of crewmembers not previously in effect the convention could be ratified as early as 2010 in which case it would enter into force in 2011 or early 2012 if ratified the enacting countries will be required to enact legislation to implement the standards outlined in the convention if implemented our crew costs would likely increase by an indeterminable amount 

consumer regulations 

we are required to obtain certificates from the united states federal maritime commission relating to our ability to satisfy liability in cases of nonperformance of obligations to guests as well as casualty and personal injury pursuant to the united states federal maritime commission regulations we arrange through our insurers for the provision of guarantees aggregating 300 million for our shipoperating companies as a condition to obtaining the required certificates the united states federal maritime commission has recently issued an inquiry to solicit information concerning the benefits and burdens of the financial responsibility regulations which could result in enactment of revisions to the regulations that could significantly increase the amount of our bonds and accordingly increase our costs of compliance 

we are also required by the united kingdom and other jurisdictions to establish our financial responsibility for any liability resulting from the nonperformance of our obligations to guests from these jurisdictions in the united kingdom we are currently required by the association of british travel agents to provide performance bonds totaling approximately £238 million we are also required to pay to the united kingdom civil aviation authority a nonrefundable levy of £250 per guest where we arrange a flight as part of the cruise vacation 

taxation of the company 

united states federal income tax 

the following discussion of the application of the united states federal income tax laws to us and our subsidiaries is based on the current provisions of the united states internal revenue code treasury department regulations administrative rulings and court decisions all of the foregoing is subject to change and any such change could affect the accuracy of this discussion 

application of section 883 of the internal revenue code 

we and our subsidiary celebrity cruises inc the operator of celebrity cruises and azamara club cruises are foreign corporations engaged in a trade or business in the united states and our shipowning subsidiaries are foreign corporations that in many cases depending upon the itineraries of their ships receive income from sources within the united states under section 883 of the internal revenue code certain foreign corporations are not subject to united states federal income or branch profits tax on united states source income derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships including income from the leasing of such ships 

  

a foreign corporation will qualify for the benefits of section 883 if in relevant part 1 the foreign country in which the foreign corporation is organized grants an equivalent exemption to corporations organized in the united states and 2a more than 50 of the value of the corporation’s capital stock is owned directly or indirectly by individuals who are residents of a foreign country that grants such an equivalent exemption to corporations organized in the united states or b the stock of the corporation or the direct or indirect corporate parent thereof is “primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market” in the united states or another qualifying country such as norway in the opinion of our united states tax counsel drinker biddle  reath llp based on the representations and assumptions set forth in that opinion we celebrity cruises inc and our shipowning subsidiaries qualify for the benefits of section 883 because we and each of those subsidiaries are incorporated in liberia or malta which are qualifying countries and our common stock is primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market in the united states or norway if in the future 1 liberia no longer qualifies as an equivalent exemption jurisdiction and we do not reincorporate in a jurisdiction that does qualify for the exemption or 2 we fail to qualify as a publicly traded corporation we and all of our shipowning or operating subsidiaries that rely on section 883 for tax exemption on qualifying income would be subject to united states federal income tax on their united states source shipping income and income from activities incidental thereto 

we believe that most of our income and the income of our shipowning subsidiaries is derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships and therefore is exempt from taxation under section 883 in 2005 final regulations became effective under section 883 which among other things narrowed somewhat the scope of activities that are considered by the internal revenue service to be incidental to the international operation of ships the activities listed in the regulations as not being incidental to the international operation of ships include income from the sale of air and land transportation shore excursions and pre and postcruise tours to the extent the income from these activities is earned from sources within the united states that income will be subject to united states taxation but the determination of the precise amount of such united states source income involves some uncertainties 

under certain circumstances changes in the identity residence or holdings of our direct or indirect shareholders could cause our common stock not to be “regularly traded on an established securities market” within the meaning of the regulations under section 883 to substantially reduce any such risk in may 2000 our articles of incorporation were amended to prohibit any person other than our two existing largest shareholders from owning directly or constructively as determined for purposes of section 883c3 of the internal revenue code and the regulations promulgated under it more than 49 of the relevant class or classes of our shares under liberian law this amendment may not be enforceable with respect to shares of common stock that were voted against the amendment or that were recorded as abstaining from the vote 

also it should be noted that section 883 has been the subject of legislative modifications in past years that have had the effect of limiting its availability to certain taxpayers and there can be no assurance that future legislation will not preclude us from obtaining the benefits of section 883 

taxation in the absence of an exemption under section 883 of the internal revenue code 

if we celebrity cruises inc or our shipowning subsidiaries were to fail to meet the requirements of section 883 of the internal revenue code or if the provision was repealed then as explained below such companies would be subject to united states income taxation on a portion of their income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships 

  

because we and celebrity cruises inc conduct a trade or business in the united states we and celebrity cruises inc would be taxable at regular corporate rates on our separate company taxable income ie without regard to the income of our shipowning subsidiaries from united states sources which includes 100 of income if any from transportation that begins and ends in the united states not including possessions of the united states 50 of income from transportation that either begins or ends in the united states and no income from transportation that neither begins nor ends in the united states the legislative history of the transportation income source rules suggests that a cruise that begins and ends in a united states port but that calls on more than one foreign port will derive united states source income only from the first and last legs of such cruise this conclusion is not free from doubt however because there are no regulations or other internal revenue service interpretations of the above rules in addition if any of our earnings and profits effectively connected with our united states trade or business were withdrawn or were deemed to have been withdrawn from our united states trade or business those withdrawn amounts would be subject to a “branch profits” tax at the rate of 30 the amount of such earnings and profits would be equal to the aforesaid united states source income with certain generally minor adjustments less income taxes we and celebrity cruises inc would also be potentially subject to tax on portions of certain interest paid by us at rates of up to 30 

if section 883 were not available to our shipowning subsidiaries each such subsidiary would be subject to a special 4 tax on its united states source gross transportation income if any each year because it does not have a fixed place of business in the united states and its income is derived from the leasing of a ship such united states source gross transportation income may be determined under any reasonable method including ratios of days traveling directly to or from united states ports to total days traveling or of the lessee’s united states source gross income from the ship as determined under the source rules discussed in the preceding paragraph and subject to the assumptions and qualifications set forth therein to the lessee’s total gross income from the ship 

maltese income tax 

our pullmantur ship owneroperator subsidiaries qualify as licensed shipping organizations in malta no maltese income tax is charged on the income derived from shipping activities of a licensed shipping organization instead a licensed shipping organization is liable to pay a tonnage tax based on the net tonnage of the ship or ships registered under the relevant provisions of the merchant shipping act a company qualifies as a shipping organization if it engages in qualifying activities and it obtains a license from the registrargeneral to enable it to carry on such activities qualifying activities include but are not limited to the ownership operation under charter or otherwise administration and management of a ship or ships registered as a maltese ship in terms of the merchant shipping act and the carrying on of all ancillary financial security and commercial activities in connection therewith 

our maltese operations that do not qualify as licensed shipping organizations which are not considered significant remain subject to normal maltese corporate income tax 

united kingdom income tax 

the brilliance of the seas is operated by a company that is strategically and commercially managed in the united kingdom which has elected to be subject to the united kingdom tonnage tax regime “uk tonnage tax” companies subject to uk tonnage tax pay a corporate tax on a notional profit determined with reference to the net tonnage of qualifying vessels normal united kingdom corporate income tax is not chargeable on the relevant shipping profits of a qualifying uk tonnage tax company the requirements for a company to qualify for the uk tonnage tax regime include being subject to united kingdom corporate income tax operating qualifying ships which are strategically and commercially managed in the united kingdom and fulfilling a seafarer training requirement 

relevant shipping profits include income from the operation of qualifying ships and from shipping related activities our united kingdom income from nonshipping activities which do not qualify under the uk tonnage tax regime and which are not considered significant remain subject to united kingdom corporate income tax 

state taxation

 item 1a risk factors tableend the risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k are important factors among others that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historical results it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently this list should not be considered a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a cautionary note regarding forwardlooking statements 

the adverse impact of the current worldwide economic environment on the demand for cruises could adversely impact our operating results cash flows and financial condition 

the demand for cruises is affected by international national and local economic and business conditions the current worldwide economic environment including high unemployment rates the volatility in the price of fuel and declines in the securities real estate and other markets has had an adverse effect on vacationers’ discretionary income and consumer confidence this in turn has resulted in cruise booking slowdowns decreased cruise prices and lower onboard revenues for us and for the others in the cruise industry while we have recently begun to discern improvements in the current economic environment we cannot predict the extent or strength of these improvements if the current environment worsens we could experience a prolonged period of booking slowdowns depressed cruise prices and reduced onboard revenues this could adversely impact our operating results cash flows and financial condition including the impairment of the value of our ships goodwill and other intangible assets 

we may not be able to obtain sufficient financing or capital for our needs or may not be able to do so on terms that are acceptable or consistent with our expectations 

to fund our capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments we have historically relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations drawdowns under available credit facilities the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the sale of equity or debt securities in private or public securities markets the decrease in consumer cruise spending as a result of the current economic environment is adversely impacting our cash flows from operations the disruption of the credit markets in 2008 and 2009 resulted in a lack of liquidity worldwide a recurrence of these events may affect our ability to successfully raise capital or to do so on acceptable terms these factors may prevent us from having sufficient available capital or financing to meet our needs or to do so on acceptable terms in addition our senior debt credit rating is currently bb with a negative outlook by standard and poor’s and ba3 with a negative outlook by moody’s and our corporate credit rating is ba2 with a negative outlook by moody’s there is no assurance that our credit ratings will not be lowered further the lowering of our credit ratings may increase our cost of financing and can make it more difficult for us to access the financial markets we will be required to secure allure of the seas if at the time we draw down on our loan to purchase the vessel our senior debt is rated below bb by standard  poor’s or below ba3 by moody’s see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity and capital resources 

  

the impact of disruptions in the global financial markets may affect the ability of our counterparties and others to perform their obligations to us 

the economic events during 2008 and 2009 including failures of financial service companies and the related liquidity crisis disrupted the capital and credit markets a recurrence of these disruptions could cause our counterparties and others to breach their obligations to us under our contracts with them this could include failures of banks or other financial service companies to fund required borrowings under our loan agreements or to pay us amounts that may become due under our derivative contracts for hedging of fuel prices interest rates and foreign currencies or other agreements if this occurs it may have a negative impact on our cash flows including our ability to meet our obligations results of operations and financial condition 

the increase in capacity resulting from delivery of newbuilds currently on order within the cruise industry could further adversely impact the demand for cruises or cruise pricing 

a total of 27 new ships are on order for delivery through 2013 in the cruise industry four of which are ours the current worldwide economic environment has led to lower cruise prices and lower onboard purchases all of which have adversely affected our revenues the further growth in capacity from these new ships without an increase in the cruise industry’s share of the vacation market could further depress cruise prices and compound our ability to achieve yield improvement 

we may lose business to competitors throughout the vacation market  

we operate in the vacation market and cruising is one of many alternatives for people choosing a vacation we therefore risk losing business not only to other cruise lines but also to other vacation operators which provide other leisure options including hotels resorts and package holidays and tours 

we face significant competition from other cruise lines on the basis of cruise pricing travel agent preference and also in terms of the nature of ships and services we offer to passengers our principal competitors within the cruise vacation industry include carnival corporation  plc which owns among others aida cruises carnival cruise lines costa cruises cunard line holland america line iberocruceros po cruises and princess cruises disney cruise line msc cruises norwegian cruise line and oceania cruises 

in the event that we do not compete effectively with other vacation alternatives and cruise companies or our competitors offer travel agents higher commission rates and incentives in the future our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

fears of terrorist and pirate attacks war and other hostilities and the spread of contagious diseases could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

events such as terrorist and pirate attacks war and other hostilities and the resulting political instability travel restrictions the spread of contagious diseases and concerns over safety health and security aspects of traveling have had and could have in the future a significant adverse impact on demand and pricing in the travel and vacation industry these events could also impact our ability to source qualified crew from throughout the world at competitive costs and therefore increase our shipboard employee costs 

incidents or adverse publicity concerning the cruise vacation industry or unusual weather conditions could affect our reputation and harm our future sales and results of operations 

the operation of cruise ships involves the risk of accidents illnesses and other incidents which may bring into question passenger safety health security and vacation satisfaction and create a perception that cruising is more dangerous than other vacation alternatives incidents involving cruise ships adverse media publicity concerning the cruise vacation industry or unusual weather patterns or natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes could impact demand and consequently have an adverse impact on our results of operations and on future industry performance 

  

environmental health and safety financial responsibility and other maritime regulations could affect operations and increase operating costs 

the united states and various state and foreign government or regulatory agencies have enacted or are considering new environmental regulations or policies such as requiring the use of low sulfur fuels increasing fuel efficiency requirements or further restricting emissions that could increase our cost for fuel and adversely impact the cruise vacation industry an increase in fuel prices not only impacts our fuel costs but also some of our other expenses such as crew travel freight and commodity prices in addition initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions have been introduced or are being considered in several european countries and numerous bills related to climate change have been introduced in the united states although not all are likely to become law it is apparent that future legislation related to climate change could likely impact all businesses including the cruise industry and adversely impact our costs some environmental groups have also lobbied for more stringent regulation of cruise ships and have generated negative publicity about the cruise vacation industry and its environmental impact in addition we are subject to various international national state and local laws regulations and treaties that govern among other things safety standards applicable to our ships health and sanitary standards applicable to our passengers security standards on board our ships and at the shipport interface areas and financial responsibilities to our passengers these issues are and we believe will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world this could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise ships that would subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 

conducting business internationally may result in increased costs and other risks 

we operate our business internationally and plan to continue to develop our international presence operating internationally exposes us to a number of risks examples include unstable local political or economic conditions and risk of increases in duties and taxes as well as changes in laws and policies affecting cruising vacation or maritime businesses or governing the operations of foreignbased companies additional risks include currency fluctuations interest rate movements imposition of trade barriers and restrictions on repatriation of earnings if we are unable to address these risks adequately our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we have ship construction contracts which are denominated in euros while we have entered into eurodenominated forward contracts to manage a portion of the currency risk associated with these ship construction contracts we are exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate for the portion of the ship construction contracts that has not been hedged if the shipyard is unable to perform under the related ship construction contract any foreign currency hedges that were entered into to manage the currency risk would need to be terminated termination of these contracts could result in a significant loss 

our attempts to expand our business into new markets may not be successful 

historically our focus has been to serve the north american cruise market which continues to be our primary source of cruise passengers we have expanded our focus to increase our international passenger sourcing most recently in the brazilian asian and australian markets expansion into new markets requires significant levels of investment there can be no assurance that these markets will develop as anticipated or that we will have success in these markets and if we do not we may be unable to recover our investment which could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

ship construction delays or mechanical faults may result in cancellation of cruises or unscheduled drydocks and repairs and thus adversely affect our results of operations 

we depend on shipyards to construct and deliver our cruise ships on a timely basis and in good working order the sophisticated nature of building a ship involves risks delays or mechanical faults in ship construction have in the past and may in the future result in delays or cancellation of cruises or necessitate unscheduled drydocks and repairs of ships we have for example experienced mechanical problems with the pod propulsion units on certain ships and there can be no assurance that we will not experience such problems in the future these events and any related adverse publicity could result in lost revenue increased operating expenses or both and thus adversely affect our results of operations 

  

the current worldwide economic environment is resulting in financial difficulties for shipyards and their subcontractors this may cause or result in delivery delays ship cancellations or increases in shipbuilding costs that could adversely affect our results of operations 

the current worldwide economic environment is causing a loss of business for shipyards and their subcontractors which could result in financial difficulties liquidations or closures these events could adversely affect the timely delivery or costs of new ships or the ability of shipyards to repair and refurbish our existing fleet in accordance with our needs or expectations delivery delays and cancelled deliveries can adversely affect our results of operations as can any constraints on our ability to repair and maintain our ships on a timely basis 

our operating costs and taxes could increase due to market forces and economic or geo political factors beyond our control 

our operating costs including fuel food payroll airfare for our shipboard personnel insurance and security costs are subject to increases due to market forces and economic or political instability or other factors beyond our control increases in these operating costs could adversely affect our profitability in addition the recent volatility in the price of fuel is making our ability to predict fuel prices extremely difficult united states state and local authorities as well as foreign authorities periodically consider increases in taxes any such tax increases could also cause an increase in our costs 

unavailability of ports of call may adversely affect our results of operations  

we believe that port destinations are a major reason why passengers choose to go on a particular cruise or on a cruise vacation the availability of ports is affected by a number of factors including but not limited to existing capacity constraints security concerns adverse weather conditions and natural disasters financial limitations on port development exclusivity arrangements that ports may have with our competitors local governmental regulations and local community concerns about port development and other adverse impacts on their communities from additional tourists any limitations on the availability of our ports of call or on the availability of shore excursion and other service providers at such ports could adversely affect our results of operations 

price increases for commercial airline service for our passengers or major changes or reduction in commercial airline service could adversely impact the demand for cruises and undermine our ability to provide reasonably priced vacation packages to our passengers 

many of our passengers depend on scheduled commercial airline services to transport them to or from the ports where our cruises embark or disembark increases in the price of airfare would increase the overall price of the cruise vacation to our passengers which may adversely impact demand for our cruises in addition changes in the availability of commercial airline services could adversely affect our passenger’s ability to obtain airfare as well as our ability to fly our passengers to or from our cruise ships which could adversely affect our results of operations 

changes or disruptions to the travel agency industry could adversely affect our results of operations 

we rely on travel agencies to generate the majority of bookings for our ships if the current economic environment continues for an extended period of time or worsens these agencies could be adversely impacted and significant disruptions or contractions could occur to these businesses this could reduce the number of travel agencies available for us to market and sell our cruises if these events were to occur it could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

a disruption in our shoreside business may adversely affect our results of operations 

our principal executive office and shoreside operations are located at the port of miami florida and we have large call centers for reservations in springfield oregon wichita kansas and addlestone england although we have developed disaster recovery and similar contingency plans actual or threatened natural disasters ie hurricanes earthquakes tornados fires floods information systems failure or similar events in these locations may have a material impact to our business continuity and results of operations further we do not carry business interruption insurance for the majority of our shoreside operations as such any losses or damages incurred by us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

  

failure to develop the value of our brands and differentiate our products could adversely affect our results of operations 

our success depends on the strength and continued development of our cruise brands and on the effectiveness of our brand strategies our brands have the ability to expand and target the markets in which they operate which is critical to increasing our customer base failure to protect and differentiate our brands from competitors throughout the vacation market could adversely affect our results of operations 

the loss of key personnel our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel or disruptions among our shipboard personnel due to strained collective bargaining relationships could adversely affect our results of operations 

our success depends in large part on the skills and contributions of key executives and other employees and on our ability to recruit and retain high quality employees we must continue to recruit retain and motivate management and other employees sufficient to maintain our current business and support our projected growth furthermore as of december 31 2009 80 of our shipboard employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements a dispute under our collective bargaining agreements could result in a work stoppage of those employees covered by the agreements a loss of key employees or disruptions among our shipboard personnel could adversely affect our results of operations 

a change in our tax status under the united states internal revenue code or other jurisdictions may have adverse effects on our income  

we and a number of our subsidiaries are foreign corporations that derive income from a united states trade or business andor from sources within the united states drinker biddle  reath llp our united states tax counsel has delivered to us an opinion based on certain representations and assumptions set forth in it to the effect that this income to the extent derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships is exempt from united states federal income tax pursuant to section 883 of the internal revenue code we believe that most of our income including that of our subsidiaries is derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships 

it should also be noted that the provisions of section 883 are subject to change at any time by legislation moreover changes could occur in the future with respect to the identity residence or holdings of our direct or indirect shareholders or relevant foreign tax laws that could affect our eligibility for the section 883 exemption accordingly there can be no assurance that we will continue to be exempt from united states income tax on united states source shipping income in the future if we were not entitled to the benefit of section 883 we and our subsidiaries would be subject to united states taxation on a portion of the income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships which would reduce our net income see taxation of the company above for a discussion of such taxation in the absence of an exemption under section 883 

finally changes in the income tax laws affecting our operations in malta spain the united kingdom or elsewhere could result in higher income taxes being charged against our operations resulting in lower net income 

we are controlled by principal shareholders that have the power to determine our policies management and actions requiring shareholder approval 

as of february 12 2010 a wilhelmsen as a norwegian corporation indirectly owned by members of the wilhelmsen family of norway owned approximately 201 of our common stock and cruise associates a bahamian general partnership indirectly owned by various trusts primarily for the benefit of certain members of the pritzker family and a trust primarily for the benefit of certain members of the ofer family owned approximately 155 of our common stock a sale of shares by a wilhelmsen as or cruise associates could cause a drop in our share prices 

a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates are parties to a shareholders’ agreement which provides that they will each vote their shares for the election of four nominees of a wilhelmsen as four nominees of cruise associates and our chief executive officer our articles of incorporation require that during the term of the shareholders agreement the approval of at least one director nominated by a wilhelmsen as and one director nominated by cruise associates is required for certain corporate actions as such a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates have the power to determine among other things our policies the persons who will be our officers and actions requiring shareholder approval 

  

a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates are not prohibited from engaging in a business that may compete with our business subject to certain exceptions if any person other than a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates acquires ownership of more than 30 of our common stock and our two principal shareholders in the aggregate own less of our common stock than such person and do not collectively have the right to elect or to designate for election at least a majority of the board of directors we may be obligated to prepay indebtedness outstanding under the majority of our credit facilities which we may be unable to replace on similar terms if this were to occur it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity and operations 

we are not a united states corporation and our shareholders may be subject to the uncertainties of a foreign legal system in protecting their interests 

our corporate affairs are governed by our restated articles of incorporation and bylaws and by the business corporation act of liberia the provisions of the business corporation act of liberia resemble provisions of the corporation laws of a number of states in the united states however while most states have a fairly well developed body of case law interpreting their respective corporate statutes there are very few judicial cases in liberia interpreting the business corporation act of liberia as such the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under liberian law are not as clearly established as the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in certain united states jurisdictions for example the right of shareholders to bring a derivative action in liberian courts may be more limited than in united states jurisdictions there may also be practical difficulties for shareholders attempting to bring suit in liberia and liberian courts may or may not recognize and enforce foreign judgments thus our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests with respect to actions by management directors or controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a united states jurisdiction 

litigation enforcement actions fines or penalties could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations andor damage our reputation 

our business is subject to various united states and international laws and regulations that could lead to enforcement actions fines civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims and damages in addition improper conduct by our employees or agents could damage our reputation andor lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties including substantial monetary fines in certain circumstances it may not be economical to defend against such matters andor a legal strategy may not ultimately result in us prevailing in a matter such events could lead to an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend in january 2010 we reached a settlement with rolls royce coproducer of the mermaid podpropulsion system on celebrity cruises’ millenniumclass ships in our lawsuit pending in the circuit court for miamidade county florida against rolls royce for the recurring mermaid pod failures under the terms of the settlement we will receive payments of approximately 856 million net of costs and payments to insurers of which 200 million will be payable within five years as part of the settlement each party has agreed to the dismissal of the lawsuit with prejudice and to release the other from all claims and counterclaims made by each party against the other this award will be recognized in our consolidated financial statements in the first quarter of 2010 within other expense income 

the miami district office of the united states equal employment opportunity commission “eeoc” has alleged that certain of our shipboard employment practices do not comply with united states employment laws in june 2007 the eeoc proposed payment of monetary sanctions of approximately 270 million and certain remedial actions following discussions with the eeoc regarding this matter the eeoc informed us in april 2008 that they transferred the matter to its legal unit for litigation review to date no legal proceedings have been initiated we believe we have meritorious defenses to these claims and if proceedings are initiated we intend to vigorously pursue them 

in 2008 the office of the attorney general of florida initiated an investigation to determine whether there had been a violation of florida or federal antitrust laws in connection with the imposition of supplemental charges for fuel implemented by a number of cruise lines the attorney general sought and received documentary information from the company in february 2010 the company was informed that the attorney general has no plans to take any further action 

in january 2006 a purported class action lawsuit was filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york alleging that we and certain other named cruise lines infringed rights in copyrighted works and other intellectual property by presenting performances on our cruise ships without securing the necessary licenses in march 2009 the court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim with sufficient particularity but granted leave to refile in april 2009 plaintiffs filed an amended complaint with substantially the same allegations as the original complaint except that it no longer seeks class action treatment and confines its allegations of infringement to plaintiffs’ copyrights of the theatrical production of grease  the suit seeks payment of damages against all named defendants in an undetermined amount of not less than 100 million as well as disgorgement of profits a permanent injunction against future infringement and punitive and treble damages we have filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint or alternatively to sever and transfer the case to the united states district court for the southern district of florida we believe we have meritorious defenses to these claims which we will continue to vigorously pursue 

  

in july 2009 three purported class actions were filed in united states district court for the eastern district of michigan against park west galleries inc doing business as park west gallery pwg florida inc fine art sales inc vista fine art llc doing business as park west at sea together “park west” and other named and unnamed parties including royal caribbean cruises ltd and celebrity cruises inc and other unaffiliated cruise line companies the actions are being brought on behalf of purchasers of artwork at shipboard art auctions conducted by park west on the named cruise lines all three actions were subsequently transferred to the united states district court for the western district of washington and are no longer being brought on a class action basis also pending in the western district of washington as a result of transfer are two other actions against park west and other unaffiliated cruise line companies that after being transferred were amended to add royal caribbean cruises ltd and celebrity cruises inc as defendants one of these actions is being brought on a class action basis the substance of the claims in all five actions is virtually the same the suits allege that the artwork park west sells is not what it represents to its customers and that royal caribbean cruises ltd celebrity cruises inc and other named cruise lines are complicit in the activities of park west including engaging in a conspiracy with park west in violation of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act “rico” and are being enriched unjustly from the sale of the artwork the actions seek from the named defendants refund and restitution of all monies acquired from the sale of artwork at shipboard auctions recovery for the amount of payments for the purchased artwork damages on the rico claims in an indeterminate amount permitted statutory damages and unspecified equitable or injunctive relief the suits also seek from certain nonroyal caribbean parties additional statutory breach of contract and breach of warranty damages in unspecified amounts the suits are at their very early stages of litigation however we believe we have meritorious defenses to the claims against us and we intend to vigorously pursue them 

in september 2009 demands for arbitration were made under our collective bargaining agreement covering celebrity cruises’ crewmembers on behalf of twenty current andor former celebrity cruises’ cabin stewards and others similarly situated the “september 2009 demands” these demands contend that between 2001 and 2005 celebrity cruises improperly required the named cabin stewards to share guest gratuities with assistant cabin stewards the demands seek payment of damages including penalty wages under the us seaman’s wage act of approximately 06 million for the named crewmembers and estimates damages in excess of 2000 million for the entire class of other similarly situated crewmembers in october 2009 and again in december 2009 additional demands for arbitration were made under our collective bargaining agreement covering celebrity cruises’ crewmembers by the same counsel on behalf of a total of three current andor former celebrity cruises’ cabin stewards and others similarly situated making the same contentions and seeking the same damages as in the september 2009 demands a similar action brought by this same counsel in october 2009 on behalf of ten crew members and others similarly situated in the southern district court southern district of florida making the same contentions and seeking the same damages as the arbitration demands was dismissed with prejudice we believe we have meritorious defenses to the pending arbitration demands which we intend to vigorously pursue 

we are routinely involved in other claims typical within the cruise vacation industry the majority of these claims are covered by insurance we believe the outcome of such claims net of expected insurance recoveries will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america see note 1 general and note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  certain of our accounting policies are deemed “critical” as they require management’s highest degree of judgment estimates and assumptions we have discussed these accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors we believe our most critical accounting policies are as follows 

ship accounting 

our ships represent our most significant assets and are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation depreciation of ships is generally computed net of a 15 projected residual value using the straightline method over estimated service lives of primarily 30 years our service life and residual value estimates take into consideration the impact of anticipated technological changes longterm cruise and vacation market conditions and historical useful lives of similarlybuilt ships in addition we take into consideration our estimates of the average useful lives of the ships’ major component systems such as hull superstructure main electric engines and cabins given the very large and complex nature of our ships our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain we do not have cost segregation studies performed to specifically componentize our ship systems therefore we estimate the costs of component systems based principally on general and technical information known about major ship component systems and their lives and our knowledge of the cruise vacation industry we do not identify and track depreciation by ship component systems but instead utilize these estimates to determine the net cost basis of assets replaced or refurbished improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized as additions to the ship and depreciated over the improvements’ estimated useful lives the estimated cost and accumulated depreciation of replaced or refurbished ship components are written off and any resulting losses are recognized in cruise operating expenses 

we use the deferral method to account for drydocking costs under the deferral method drydocking costs incurred are deferred and charged to expense on a straightline basis over the period to the next scheduled drydock which we estimate to be a period of thirty to sixty months based on the vessel’s age as required by class deferred drydock costs consist of the costs to drydock the vessel and other costs incurred in connection with the drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessel’s class certification class certification is necessary in order for our cruise ships to be flagged in a specific country obtain liability insurance and legally operate as passenger cruise ships the activities associated with those drydocking costs cannot be performed while the vessel is in service and as such are done during a drydock as a planned major maintenance activity 

  

the significant deferred drydock costs consist of hauling and wharfage services provided by the drydock facility hull inspection and related activities eg scraping pressure cleaning bottom painting maintenance to steering propulsion stabilizers thruster equipment and ballast tanks port services such as tugs pilotage and line handling and freight associated with these items we perform a detailed analysis of the various activities performed for each drydock and only defer those costs that are directly related to planned major maintenance activities necessary to maintain class the costs deferred are not otherwise routinely periodically performed to maintain a vessel’s designed and intended operating capability repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred 

we use judgment when estimating the period between drydocks which can result in adjustments to the estimated amortization of drydock costs if the vessel is disposed of before the next drydock the remaining balance in deferred drydock is writtenoff to the gain or loss upon disposal of vessel in the period in which the sale takes place we also use judgment when identifying costs incurred during a drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessel’s class certification as compared to those costs attributable to repairs and maintenance which are expensed as incurred see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

we believe we have made reasonable estimates for ship accounting purposes however should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimates of ship service lives or projected residual values depreciation expense could be materially higher or lower if circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making determinations as to whether ship improvements should be capitalized the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance costs could increase partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense if we had reduced our estimated average 30year ship service life by one year depreciation expense for 2009 would have increased by approximately 222 million if our ships were estimated to have no residual value depreciation expense for 2009 would have increased by approximately 1158 million 

valuation of longlived assets goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

we review our ships and other longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of these assets based on our estimate of their undiscounted future cash flows if estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of an asset an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the asset’s estimated fair value and its carrying value 

we determine fair value based on quoted market prices in active markets if available if active markets are not available we base fair value on independent appraisals sales price negotiations and projected future cash flows discounted at a rate determined by management to be commensurate with the business risk the estimation of fair value utilizing discounted forecasted cash flows includes numerous uncertainties which require significant judgment when making assumptions of revenues operating costs marketing selling and administrative expenses interest rates cruise vacation industry competition and general economic and business conditions among other factors quoted market prices are often not available for individual reporting units and for indefinitelife intangible assets accordingly we base the fair value of a reporting unit and an indefinitelife intangible asset on an expected present value technique 

we review goodwill trademarks and tradenames which are our most significant indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate but at least annually the impairment review for goodwill consists of a two step process of first determining the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it to the carrying value of the net assets allocated to the reporting unit if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value no further analysis or writedown of goodwill is required if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of its net assets the implied fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all its underlying assets and liabilities including both recognized and unrecognized tangible and intangible assets based on their fair value if necessary goodwill is then written down to its implied fair value the impairment review for indefinitelife intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess if the fair value exceeds its carrying amount the indefinitelife intangible asset is not considered impaired 

  

we performed our annual impairment review for goodwill during the fourth quarter of 2009 we determined the fair value of our two reporting units which include goodwill royal caribbean international and pullmantur using a probabilityweighted discounted cash flow model the principal assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model are projected operating results weightedaverage cost of capital and terminal value cash flows were calculated using our 2010 projected operating results as a base to that base we added future years’ cash flows assuming multiple revenue and expense scenarios that reflect the impact on each reporting unit of different global economic environments beyond 2010 we assigned a probability to each revenue and expense scenario 

we discounted the projected cash flows using rates specific to each reporting unit based on their respective weightedaverage cost of capital based on the probabilityweighted discounted cash flows of each reporting unit we determined the fair values of royal caribbean international and pullmantur exceeded their carrying values therefore we did not proceed to step two of the impairment analysis and we do not consider goodwill to be impaired 

in performing our goodwill impairment analysis we considered the fact that at december 31 2009 the book value of our shareholders’ equity exceeded our market capitalization we did not consider this to be determinative given that our market capitalization increased approximately 85 during 2009 and given the still highly uncertain economic outlook of the united states and other countries in which we operate 

we also performed the annual impairment review of our trademarks and trade names during the fourth quarter of 2009 using a discounted cash flow model and the relieffromroyalty method the royalty rate used is based on comparable royalty agreements in the tourism and hospitality industry since these trademarks and trade names relate to pullmantur we used the same discount rate used in valuing the pullmantur reporting unit in our goodwill impairment test based on the discounted cash flow model we determined the fair value of our trademarks and trade names exceeded their carrying value 

the estimation of fair value utilizing discounted expected future cash flows includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of expected revenues operating costs marketing selling and administrative expenses interest rates ship additions and retirements as well as assumptions regarding the cruise vacation industry competition and general economic and business conditions among other factors if there is a material change in the assumptions used in our determination of fair values or if there is a material change in the conditions or circumstances influencing fair value we could be required to recognize a material impairment charge for example the spanish economy has been harder impacted than most other economies around the world where we trade and there is significant uncertainty as to whether or when it will recover if that economy weakens more than contemplated in our discounted cash flow model that could trigger an impairment charge 

contingencies — litigation 

on an ongoing basis we assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss if any can be made in assessing probable losses we take into consideration estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries if any we accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recoveries it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made 

derivative instruments 

we enter into forward and swap contracts to manage our interest rate exposure and to limit our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices the vast majority of these instruments are designated as hedges and are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value we have also entered into fuel call options to limit our exposure to fluctuations in fuel prices these instruments are economic hedges which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes and thus changes in their fair value are immediately recognized in earnings our derivative instruments are not held for trading or speculative purposes we account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with authoritative guidance refer to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies and note 13 fair value measurements and derivative instruments to our consolidated financial statements for more information on related authoritative guidance the company’s hedging programs and derivative financial instruments 

  

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate crosscurrency and fuel swaps with third party institutions in overthecounter markets we estimate the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate and crosscurrency swaps using expected future cash flows based on the instruments’ contract terms and published forward curves for foreign currency exchange and interest rates we apply present value techniques and liborbased discount rates to convert the expected future cash flows to the current fair value of the instruments 

we estimate the fair value of our fuel swaps using expected future cash flows based on the swaps’ contract terms and forward prices we derive forward prices from forward fuel curves based on pricing inputs provided by thirdparty institutions that transact in the fuel indices we hedge we validate these pricing inputs against actual market transactions we apply present value techniques and liborbased discount rates to convert the expected future cash flows to the current fair value of the instruments we also corroborate our fair value estimates using valuations provided by our counterparties 

we estimate the fair value of fuel call options using standard option pricing models with inputs based on the options’ contract terms such as exercise price and maturity and data either readily available or derived from public market information such as fuel curves volatility levels and discount rates we corroborate our fair value estimates using valuations provided by our counterparties 

we adjust the valuation of our derivative financial instruments to incorporate credit risk when applicable 

we believe it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate crosscurrency and fuel swaps and options would be derived from using other valuation models assumptions inputs or conditions suggested by actual historical experience 

terminology 

our revenues are seasonal based on demand for cruises demand is strongest for cruises during the northern hemisphere’s summer months and holidays 

our revenues consist of the following 

passenger ticket revenues consist of revenue recognized from the sale of passenger tickets and the sale of air transportation to and from our ships 

onboard and other revenues consist primarily of revenues from the sale of goods andor services onboard our ships not included in passenger ticket prices cancellation fees sales of vacation protection insurance pre and postcruise tours pullmantur’s landbased tours and hotel and air packages also included are revenues we receive from independent third party concessionaires that pay us a percentage of their revenues in exchange for the right to provide selected goods andor services onboard our ships 

our cruise operating expenses consist of the following 

commissions transportation and other expenses consist of those costs directly associated with passenger ticket revenues including travel agent commissions air and other transportation expenses port costs that vary with passenger head counts and related credit card fees 

  

onboard and other expenses consist of the direct costs associated with onboard and other revenues these costs include the cost of products sold onboard our ships vacation protection insurance premiums costs associated with pre and postcruise tours and related credit card fees these costs also include minimal costs associated with concession revenues as the costs are mostly incurred by thirdparty concessionaires 

payroll and related expenses consist of costs for shipboard personnel 

food expenses include food costs for both passengers and crew 

fuel expenses include fuel and related delivery and storage costs including the financial impact of fuel swap agreements 

other operating expenses consist primarily of operating costs such as repairs and maintenance port costs that do not vary with passenger head counts vessel operating lease costs costs associated with pullmantur’s landbased tours vessel related insurance and entertainment 

we do not allocate payroll and related costs food costs fuel costs or other operating costs to the expense categories attributable to passenger ticket revenues or onboard and other revenues since they are incurred to provide the total cruise vacation experience 

nongaap financial measures 

available passenger cruise days “apcd” is our measurement of capacity and represents double occupancy per cabin multiplied by the number of cruise days for the period we use this measure to perform capacity and rate analysis to identify our main noncapacity drivers which cause our cruise revenue and expenses to vary 

gross cruise costs represent the sum of total cruise operating expenses plus marketing selling and administrative expenses 

gross yields represent total revenues per apcd 

net cruise costs represent gross cruise costs excluding commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses each of which is described above under the terminology heading in measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income we believe changes in net cruise costs to be the most relevant indicator of our performance a reconciliation of historical gross cruise costs to net cruise costs is provided below under summary of historical results of operations  we have not provided a quantitative reconciliation of projected gross cruise costs to projected net cruise costs due to the significant uncertainty in projecting the costs deducted to arrive at this measure accordingly we do not believe that reconciling information for such projected figures would be meaningful 

net debttocapital is a ratio which represents total longterm debt including current portion of longterm debt less cash and cash equivalents “net debt” divided by the sum of net debt and total shareholders’ equity we believe net debt and net debttocapital along with total longterm debt and shareholders’ equity are useful measures of our capital structure a reconciliation of historical debttocapital to net debttocapital is provided below under summary of historical results of operations 

net revenues represent total revenues less commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses each of which is described under the terminology heading 

net yields represent net revenues per apcd we utilize net revenues and net yields to manage our business on a daytoday basis as we believe that it is the most relevant measure of our pricing performance because it reflects the cruise revenues earned by us net of our most significant variable costs which are commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses a reconciliation of historical gross yields to net yields is provided below under summary of historical results of operations  we have not provided a quantitative reconciliation of projected gross yields to projected net yields due to the significant uncertainty in projecting the costs deducted to arrive at this measure accordingly we do not believe that reconciling information for such projected figures would be meaningful 

  

occupancy in accordance with cruise vacation industry practice is calculated by dividing passenger cruise days by apcd a percentage in excess of 100 indicates that three or more passengers occupied some cabins 

passenger cruise days represent the number of passengers carried for the period multiplied by the number of days of their respective cruises 

the use of certain significant nongaap measures such as net yields and net cruise costs allow us to perform capacity and rate analysis to separate the impact of known capacity changes from other less predictable changes which affect our business we believe these nongaap measures provide expanded insight to measure revenue and cost performance in addition to the standard united states gaap based financial measures there are no specific rules or regulations for determining nongaap measures and as such there exists the possibility that they may not be comparable to other companies within the industry 

executive overview 

total revenues were 59 billion in 2009 compared to total revenues of 65 billion in 2008 our financial results have been and may continue to be negatively affected by the economic environment including the high unemployment rates in certain markets this challenging economic environment has strained consumer discretionary spending which in turn has caused a diminished demand for our cruises and landbased tours to mexico and the caribbean in addition the adverse impact of the h1n1 flu virus had a significant effect on pullmantur’s operations during 2009 nonetheless we believe the resiliency of the cruise vacation industry coupled with the endurance of our brands allowed us to mitigate to an extent the impact of the economic environment on our 2009 results 

in late 2009 we began to experience growth in our order book and a diminishing gap in yearoveryear booked volume comparisons this acceleration in booking volumes has had a positive effect on pricing which is running ahead of the same time last year in addition the design of our solstice and oasisclass ships allows for a greater percentage of staterooms with verandas and outside staterooms which provide for premiums in pricing although we are not back to prerecession demand levels there is solid yield recovery underway as a result we expect 2010 net yields to increase in the range of 3 to 6 compared to 2009 

furthermore we have responded to the operating environment by continuously improving our cost focus through the implementation of new costcontainment initiatives including the renegotiation of longterm contracts with our vendors and a detailed emphasis on cost control in addition our solstice and oasisclass ships provide us with cost efficiencies through their scale and fuel efficiencies we expect our 2010 net cruise costs per apcd to be from flat to up slightly compared to 2009 

while cutting costs throughout the organization we have not altered our strategy of substantially growing our sourcing of international guests we continue to opportunistically increase our investments in growth outside north america with the goal of diversifying our sources and increasing opportunities for revenue growth we are also continuing our strategy of tactically spending to maintain brand standards 

lastly we believe the credit and capital markets have begun to stabilize this has improved our ability to secure financing and raise additional capital on terms that are acceptable to us we currently have three solsticeclass vessels and one oasisclass vessel under construction all of which have committed bank financing arrangements we anticipate funding our scheduled maturities in 2010 through operating cash flows and do not foresee a need to access the capital markets during 2010 although we may opportunistically decide to do so we are also continuing to pursue our longterm objective of returning to investment grade rating 

summary of historical results of operations 

total revenues decreased 98 to 59 billion in 2009 from total revenues of 65 billion in 2008 primarily due to the decrease in ticket prices net yields decreased by approximately 142 compared to 2008 the decrease in net yields was primarily due to the decrease in ticket prices partially offset by decreases in operating expenses as a result our net income was 1624 million or 075 per share on a diluted basis for 2009 compared to 5737 million or 268 per share on a diluted basis for 2008

outlook 

on january 28 2010 we announced the following guidance for the full year and first quarter of 2010 

full year 2010 

we expected net yields to increase in the range of 3 to 6 compared to 2009 

we expected net cruise costs per apcd and net cruise costs per apcd excluding fuel to be from flat to up slightly compared to 2009 

we do not forecast fuel prices and our cost calculation for fuel is based on current “atthepump” prices net of any hedging impacts if fuel prices for the full year 2010 remain at the level of january 28 2010 fuel expenses for the full year 2010 would be approximately 6870 million for the full year 2010 our fuel expense is approximately 50 hedged and a 10 change in fuel prices would result in a change in our fuel expenses of approximately 340 million for the full year 2010 after taking into account existing hedges 

we expected a 114 increase in capacity in 2010 primarily driven by a full year of oasis of the seas  which entered service in december 2009 a full year of celebrity equinox  which entered service in july 2009 a full year of pacific dream which entered service in may 2009 the addition of celebrity eclipse  which will enter service during the second quarter of 2010 and the addition of allure of the seas which will enter service in the fourth quarter of 2010 

depreciation and amortization expenses were expected to be in the range of 6400 million to 6600 million and interest expense was expected to be in the range of 3300 million to 3500 million 

based on the expectations contained in this outlook section and assuming that fuel prices remain at the level of the january 28 2010 “atthepump” prices we expected full year 2010 earnings per share to be in the range of 200 to 220 

our outlook has remained essentially unchanged since our announcement on january 28 2010 

first quarter 2010 

as announced on january 28 2010 we expected net yields to increase approximately 2 compared to 2009 

we expected net cruise costs per apcd to be approximately flat compared to 2009 excluding fuel we expected net cruise costs per apcd to increase approximately 1 compared to 2009 

we do not forecast fuel prices and our cost calculation for fuel is based on current “atthepump” prices net of any hedging impacts if fuel prices for the first quarter of 2010 remain at the level of january 28 2010 fuel expenses for the first quarter of 2010 would be approximately 1630 million for the first quarter of 2010 our fuel expense is approximately 58 hedged and a 10 change in fuel prices would result in a change in our fuel expenses of approximately 70 million for the first quarter of 2010 after taking into account existing hedges 

we expected a 92 increase in capacity primarily driven by the addition of oasis of the seas  which entered service in december 2009 the addition of celebrity equinox  which entered service in july 2009 and the addition of pacific dream which entered service in may 2009 

depreciation and amortization expenses were expected to be in the range of 1550 million to 1600 million and interest expense was expected to be in the range of 820 million to 870 million 

based on the expectations contained in this outlook section and assuming that fuel prices remain at the level of the january 28 2010 “atthepump” prices we expected a first quarter 2010 earnings per share in the range of 025 to 030 

our outlook has remained essentially unchanged since our announcement on january 28 2010 

  

year ended december 31 2009 compared to year ended december 31 2008 

revenues 

total revenues for 2009 decreased 6427 million or 98 to 59 billion from 65 billion in 2008 this decrease is primarily due to higher discounts on our ticket prices and to a lesser extent a decrease in onboard spending and the adverse effect of foreign currency as a result of a stronger united states dollar against the euro british pound and canadian dollar compared to 2008 our revenues were also adversely impacted by a decrease in occupancy from 1045 in 2008 compared to 1025 in 2009 the decrease in occupancy was driven by the current worldwide economic environment with disproportionate pressure within the spanish market in addition the adverse impact of the h1n1 virus resulted in selective itinerary modifications and diminished demand for our cruises to mexico and the caribbean this revenue decrease was partially offset by an estimated increase of approximately 3350 million attributable to an increase in capacity of 51 although the number of passengers carried in 2009 decreased as compared to 2008 on average passengers sailed more days per voyage in 2009 as compared to 2008 due to certain itinerary changes the increase in capacity is primarily due to a full year of celebrity solstice  which entered service in november 2008 a full year of independence of the seas  which entered service in may 2008 the addition of celebrity equinox  which entered service in july 2009 the addition of pacific dream which entered service in may 2009 as part of the termination of the charter to island cruises a full year of ocean dream which entered service in march 2008 and the addition of oasis of the seas  which entered service in december 2009 this increase in capacity was partially offset by the sale of celebrity galaxy to tui cruises in march 2009 the sale of oceanic in april 2009 and the atlantic star which is no longer in operation 

onboard and other revenues included concession revenues of 2156 million in 2009 compared to 2308 million for the same period in 2008 the decrease in concession revenues was primarily due to a decrease in spending on a per passenger basis partially offset by the increase in capacity mentioned above 

cruise operating expenses 

total cruise operating expenses for 2009 decreased 3326 million or 76 to 41 billion from 44 billion for 2008 this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in commissions as a result of discounted ticket prices a decrease in air expense due to a reduction in guests booking air service through us a decrease in transportation and lodging expenses related to certain itinerary changes and the impact of the stronger united states dollar against the euro british pound and canadian dollar compared to 2008 in addition fuel expenses which are net of the financial impact of fuel swap agreements decreased 179 per metric ton in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily as a result of lower fuel prices to a lesser extent the decrease was also related to a decrease in tour and air expenses these decreases were partially offset by the increase in capacity mentioned above 

marketing selling and administrative expenses 

marketing selling and administrative expenses for 2009 decreased 145 million or 19 to 7620 million from 7765 million for 2008 the decrease is mainly due to the impact of our costcontainment initiatives and to termination benefits of 90 million incurred during 2008 that did not recur in 2009 the decrease was partially offset by an increase in marketing and selling expenses associated with our international expansion 

depreciation and amortization expenses 

depreciation and amortization expenses for 2009 increased 478 million or 92 to 5682 million from 5204 million for 2008 the increase is primarily due to a full year of celebrity solstice which entered service in november 2008 a full year of independence of the seas  which entered service in may 2008 and the addition of celebrity equinox which entered service in july 2009 to a lesser extent the increase is also due to depreciation associated with shipboard and shoreside additions these increases were partially offset by the sale of celebrity galaxy to tui cruises 

other income expense 

interest expense net of interest capitalized decreased to 3000 million in 2009 from 3273 million in 2008 gross interest expense decreased to 3411 million in 2009 from 3717 million in 2008 the decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates partially offset by a higher average debt level interest capitalized decreased to 411 million in 2009 from 444 million in 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates 

  

other expense increased to 331 million in 2009 compared to other income of 549 million in 2008 for a net change of 880 million when comparing these periods the change was primarily due to 211 million in foreign currency exchange losses in 2009 as compared to 230 million in foreign currency exchange gains in 2008 for a net change of 441 million when comparing these periods this change was primarily due to the dramatic movements in exchange rates during the latter half of 2008 and most of 2009 in addition we had 152 million in losses from our equity method investments in 2009 as compared to 40 million in gains from our equity method investments in 2008 for a net change of 192 million when comparing these periods this change was primarily due to the startup of operations of one of our investments the change in other income expense was also due to a 176 million settlement gain received in the case against pentair water treatment oh company formerly known as essef corporation during 2008 that did not recur in 2009 these changes were offset by an out of period adjustment recorded in 2009 of 123 million to correct an error in our deferred tax liability the out of period adjustment represents the cumulative reduction to a deferred tax liability due to the change in the enacted spanish statutory tax rate used to calculate the liability in 2006 which was identified during the third quarter of 2009 

net yields 

net yields decreased 142 in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to the higher discounts on our ticket prices the decrease in onboard spending a stronger united states dollar compared to the euro british pound and canadian dollar as well as the impact of the itinerary modifications and diminished demand for our cruises and tours to mexico and the caribbean as mentioned above 

net cruise costs 

net cruise costs decreased 52 in 2009 compared to 2008 due to a 98 decrease in net cruise cost per apcd offset by the 51 increase in capacity mentioned above the decrease in net cruise costs per apcd was primarily driven by the decrease in fuel expenses the decrease in air and tour expenses and the decrease in marketing selling and administrative expenses 

year ended december 31 2008 compared to year ended december 31 2007 

revenues 

total revenues for 2008 increased 3834 million or 62 to 65 billion from 61 billion in 2007 approximately 3197 million of this increase is attributable to an increase in capacity of 52 the increase in capacity is primarily due to the addition of independence of the seas  which entered service in may 2008 a full year of liberty of the seas which entered service in may 2007 the addition of ocean dream  which entered service in march 2008 and the addition of celebrity solstice  which entered service in november 2008 the remaining increase of 637 million is due primarily to an increase in ticket prices partially offset by a decrease in onboard and other revenues the decrease in onboard and other revenues is due primarily to a decrease in spending on a per passenger basis 

onboard and other revenues included concession revenues of 2308 million in 2008 compared to 2393 million for the same period in 2007 the decrease in concession revenues was primarily due to a decrease in spending on a per passenger basis partially offset by the increase in capacity mentioned above 

cruise operating expenses 

total cruise operating expenses for 2008 increased 4220 million or 106 to 44 billion from 40 billion for 2007 approximately 2070 million of this increase is attributable to the 52 increase in capacity the remaining increase of 2150 million was primarily driven by increases in fuel expenses and to a lesser extent payroll and related expenses fuel expenses which are net of the financial impact of fuel swap agreements increased 300 per metric ton in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily as a result of increasing fuel prices as a percentage of total revenues fuel expenses were 111 and 89 in 2008 and 2007 respectively the increase in payroll and related expenses was associated with benefits and higher staffing levels 

  

marketing selling and administrative expenses 

marketing selling and administrative expenses for 2008 decreased 65 million or 08 to 7765 million from 7830 million for 2007 the decrease was primarily due to the cost savings initiative announced during the third quarter to reduce spending along with a change in the employee forfeiture rate assumption related to our stockbased employee compensation plans that resulted in a benefit of approximately 82 million in the second quarter of 2008 as part of the cost savings initiative we eliminated approximately 400 shoreside positions during the third quarter of 2008 the decrease due to the cost savings initiative was partially offset by termination benefits of 90 million related to the same initiative and increases in headcount and other costs associated with personnel during the first six months of 2008 

depreciation and amortization expenses 

depreciation and amortization expenses for 2008 increased 373 million or 77 to 5204 million from 4831 million for the same period in 2007 this increase is primarily due to the addition of independence of the seas which entered service in may 2008 a full year of liberty of the seas  which entered service in may 2007 and the addition of ocean dream  which entered service in march 2008 

other income expense 

interest expense net of interest capitalized decreased to 3273 million in 2008 from 3338 million in 2007 gross interest expense decreased to 3717 million in 2008 from 3737 million in 2007 the decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates partially offset by a higher average debt level interest capitalized increased to 444 million in 2008 from 399 million in 2007 primarily due to a higher average level of investment in ships under construction 

other income increased to 549 million in 2008 from 158 million in 2007 the increase was due to 230 million in foreign currency exchange gains in 2008 as compared to 67 million in foreign currency exchange losses in 2007 for a net change of 297 million when comparing these periods the increase was also due to a 176 million settlement received in the case against pentair water treatment oh company formerly known as essef corporation these increases were partially offset by a gain of 185 million in 2007 related to certain derivatives instruments associated with our ship construction firm commitments denominated in euros that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment which did not recur in 2008

net yields increased 05 in 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 primarily due to increases in ticket prices as mentioned above occupancy in 2008 was 1045 compared to 1057 in 2007 

net cruise costs 

net cruise costs increased 91 in 2008 compared to 2007 due to the 52 increase in capacity mentioned above and a 37 increase in net cruise costs per apcd the increase in net cruise costs per apcd was primarily driven by increases in fuel expenses and to a lesser extent payroll and related expenses related to shipboard employees these increases were partially offset by the decrease in marketing selling and administrative expenses as mentioned above fuel expenses represented 43 percentage points of the overall increase in net cruise costs per apcd 

restructuring initiatives 

on july 21 2008 we announced a cost savings initiative expected to save approximately 1250 million of general and administrative expenses annually this initiative was a response to the reduction in our profitability as part of this initiative we eliminated approximately 400 shoreside positions in addition we discontinued some noncore operations including the scholar ship the elimination of the shoreside positions and the discontinuation of noncore operations were concluded by the end of the third quarter of 2008 

  

as a result of this initiative we incurred charges all of which were cash charges of 143 million or 007 per share in 2008 comprised of 90 million in termination benefits and 53 million in contract termination costs expenses related to termination benefits were included in marketing selling and administrative expenses and contract termination costs were included in other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations as of december 31 2008 we paid approximately 69 million of the termination benefits and all of the contract termination costs these termination benefits were paid in 2009

liquidity and capital resources 

sources and uses of cash 

cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity net cash provided by operating activities decreased 2264 million to 8449 million for 2009 compared to 11 billion in 2008 the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in cash generated from ticket and onboard sales during 2009 compared to 2008 the decrease in cash from ticket sales is a result of a compression in the booking window forward bookings lagging behind the prior year and cruises being purchased for lower prices compared to the prior year as a result of the above factors we received an estimated 3713 million less in customer deposits during 2009 as compared to 2008 the decrease in onboard and other revenues is due to less spending per guest as compared to the prior year the decreases mentioned above were partially offset primarily by a decrease in payments to suppliers and vendors due to our continued focus on cost improvement 

net cash used in investing activities increased to 23 billion in 2009 from 20 billion in 2008 the increase was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures which were 25 billion in 2009 compared to 22 billion in 2008 capital expenditures were primarily related to the delivery of oasis of the seas and celebrity equinox in 2009 as compared to independence of the seas and celebrity solstice in 2008 the increase was also related to a decrease in settlements of approximately 1590 million on our foreign currency forward contracts and an increase in equity contributions to our unconsolidated affiliates of 1294 million the increases mentioned above were partially offset by the proceeds received from the sale of celebrity galaxy to tui cruises of 2909 million in 2009 compared to proceeds from the sale of our investment in island cruises of 514 million in 2008 

net cash provided by financing activities was 13 billion in 2009 compared to 11 billion in 2008 this change was primarily due to a decrease in dividends paid of approximately 1280 million during 2009 as compared to 2008 the change was also due to an increase in debt proceeds of approximately 938 million and a decrease in repayments of debt of approximately 391 million during 2009 we received 8400 million and €1594 or approximately 2284 million based on the exchange rate at december 31 2009 through an unsecured term loan due through 2021 to purchase oasis of the seas and 5245 million through an unsecured term loan due through 2021 to purchase celebrity equinox we also received net proceeds of 2854 million from our 3000 million senior unsecured notes issued during 2009 in addition we borrowed approximately 4250 million under our unsecured revolving credit facility of which we repaid approximately 3750 million we made debt repayments on various loan facilities and capital leases including a prepayment of approximately 1000 million to retire our unsecured term loan libor plus 138 due november 2010 this change was offset by an increase in debt issuance costs of 373 million primarily related to the oasis of the seas and celebrity equinox financings 

interest capitalized during 2009 decreased to 411 million from 444 million in 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates 

  

future capital commitments 

our future capital commitments consist primarily of new ship orders as of december 31 2009 we had one oasisclass ship designated for royal caribbean international and three solsticeclass ships designated for celebrity cruises  on order for an aggregate additional capacity of approximately 13950 berths the aggregate cost of the four ships is approximately 42 billion of which we have deposited 4307 million as of december 31 2009 approximately 90 of the aggregate cost of ships was exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate at december 31 2009 

as of december 31 2009 we anticipated overall capital expenditures including the four ships on order will be approximately 22 billion for 2010 10 billion for 2011 and 10 billion for 2012 

contractual obligations 

as of december 31 2009 our contractual obligations were as follows in thousands 

 

  

       as a normal part of our business depending on market conditions pricing and our overall growth strategy we continuously consider opportunities to enter into contracts for the building of additional ships we may also consider the sale of ships or the purchase of existing ships we continuously consider potential acquisitions and strategic alliances if any of these were to occur they would be financed through the incurrence of additional indebtedness the issuance of additional shares of equity securities or through cash flows from operations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

under the brilliance of the seas operating lease we have agreed to indemnify the lessor to the extent its aftertax return is negatively impacted by unfavorable changes in corporate tax rates capital allowance deductions and certain unfavorable determinations which may be made by united kingdom tax authorities these indemnifications could result in an increase in our lease payments we are unable to estimate the maximum potential increase in our lease payments due to the various circumstances timing or a combination of events that could trigger such indemnifications we have been advised by the lessor that the united kingdom tax authorities are disputing the lessor’s accounting treatment of the lease and that the parties are in discussions on the matter if the 

  

characterization of the lease is ultimately determined to be incorrect we could be required to indemnify the lessor under certain circumstances the lessor has advised us that they believe their characterization of the lease is correct based on the foregoing and our review of available information we do not believe an indemnification is probable however if the lessor loses its dispute and we are required to indemnify the lessor we cannot at this time predict the impact that such an occurrence would have on our financial condition and results of operations 

some of the contracts that we enter into include indemnification provisions that obligate us to make payments to the counterparty if certain events occur these contingencies generally relate to changes in taxes increased lender capital costs and other similar costs the indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms and are entered into in the normal course of business there are no stated or notional amounts included in the indemnification clauses and we are not able to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments if any under these indemnification clauses we have not been required to make any payments under such indemnification clauses in the past and under current circumstances we do not believe an indemnification obligation is probable 

other than the items described above we are not party to any other offbalance sheet arrangements including guarantee contracts retained or contingent interest certain derivative instruments and variable interest entities that either have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial position 

funding sources 

we have significant contractual obligations of which the capital expenditures associated with our ship purchases and our debt maturities represent our largest funding needs we have 32 billion in contractual obligations due in 2010 of which approximately 20 billion relates to the acquisition of the celebrity eclipse and allure of the seas along with progress payments on other ship purchases in addition we have 113 billion in contractual obligations due beyond 2010 of which debt maturities and ship purchase obligations represent 76 billion and 15 billion respectively we have historically relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations drawdowns under our available credit facilities and the incurrence of additional debt to fund these obligations 

as of december 31 2009 our liquidity was 09 billion consisting of approximately 2846 million in cash and cash equivalents and 5750 million available under our unsecured revolving credit facility in addition we had a working capital deficit of 17 billion as of december 31 2009 comparable with our working capital deficit of 17 billion as of december 31 2008 similar to others in our industry we are able to operate with a substantial working capital deficit because 1 passenger receipts are primarily paid in advance with a relatively lowlevel of accounts receivable 2 rapid turnover results in a limited investment in inventories and 3 voyagerelated accounts payable usually become due after receipt of cash from related bookings in addition we finance the purchase of our ships through longterm debt instruments of which the current portion of these instruments increases our working capital deficit the current portion of longterm debt increased from 4719 million as of december 31 2008 to 7562 million as of december 31 2009 we generate substantial cash flows from operations and our business model along with our unsecured revolving credit facility has historically allowed us to maintain this working capital deficit and still meet our operating investing and financing needs we expect that we will continue to have working capital deficits in the future 

we have three solsticeclass vessels and one oasisclass vessel under construction in germany and finland respectively all of which have committed bank financing arrangements which include financing guarantees 

we anticipate that our cash flows from operations our current available credit facilities and these financing arrangements will be adequate to meet our capital expenditures and debt repayments in the foreseeable future 

the decrease in consumer cruise spending as a result of the current economic environment has adversely impacted our cash flows from operations the disruption of the credit markets in 2008 and 2009 resulted in a lack of liquidity worldwide although we have witnessed an improvement in the credit markets and operating environment towards the end of 2009 and early 2010 a recurrence of these events may affect our ability to successfully raise capital or to do so on acceptable terms in addition our senior debt credit rating is currently bb with a negative outlook by standard and poor’s and ba3 with a negative outlook by moody’s our corporate credit rating is ba2 with a negative outlook the cumulative impact to interest expense in 2009 as a result of credit ratings downgrades which occurred during 2009 was not material to our results of operations there is no assurance that our credit ratings will not be lowered further 

  

we are focused on ensuring adequate cash and liquidity we are continually committed to improving our cost focus and have implemented costcontainment initiatives including the renegotiation of longterm contracts with our vendors and a detailed emphasis on cost control to ensure adequate liquidity we have discontinued our quarterly dividend commencing in the fourth quarter of 2008 we have tactically evaluated our nonshipbuild capital expenditures and will consider further newbuild orders as market conditions warrant however if a newbuild order were to be placed in the near term a new delivery would not arrive before 2013 we anticipate that our cash flows from operations our current available credit facilities and our current financing arrangements will be adequate to meet our capital expenditures and debt repayments over the next twelvemonth period in addition we may elect to fund our contractual obligations through other means if current conditions in the capital markets improve 

if any person other than a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates our two principal shareholders acquires ownership of more than 30 of our common stock and our two principal shareholders in the aggregate own less of our common stock than such person and do not collectively have the right to elect or to designate for election at least a majority of the board of directors we may be obligated to prepay indebtedness outstanding under the majority of our credit facilities which we may be unable to replace on similar terms if this were to occur it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity and operations 

debt covenants 

our financing agreements contain covenants that require us among other things to maintain minimum net worth and a fixed coverage ratio and limit our net debttocapital ratio our minimum net worth and maximum net debttocapital calculations exclude the impact of accumulated other comprehensive income loss on total shareholders’ equity the fixed coverage ratio is calculated by dividing net cash from operations by the sum of dividend payments plus scheduled principal debt payments in excess of any new financings for the past four quarters “fixed charges” we are currently in compliance with all debt covenants the specific covenants and related definitions can be found in the applicable debt agreements the majority of which have been previously filed with the securities and exchange commission as of december 31 2009 our net worth was 73 billion compared with a minimum requirement of 52 billion our netdebttocapital was 527 compared to a maximum limit of 625 and our fixed charge coverage ratio exceeded the minimum requirement of 125x as our fixed charges for the period were 000 

dividends 

during fiscal year 2008 we paid out dividends totaling 1280 million 

in november 2008 our board of directors discontinued our quarterly dividend commencing with the fourth quarter of 2008 this decision is intended to enhance our liquidity during this period of heightened economic and financial market uncertainty

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend financial instruments and other 

general 

we are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices we manage these risks through a combination of our normal operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments pursuant to our hedging practices and policies the financial impacts of these hedging instruments are primarily offset by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures being hedged we achieve this by closely matching the amount term and conditions of the derivative instrument with the underlying risk being hedged we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes we monitor our derivative positions using techniques including market valuations and sensitivity analyses see note 13 fair value measurements and derivative instruments to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

the turmoil in the credit and capital markets over the past couple of years has increased the volatility associated with interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices however we are taking steps to mitigate these risks 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our longterm debt obligations and our operating lease for brilliance of the seas  at december 31 2009 approximately 43 of our longterm debt was effectively fixed and approximately 57 was floating we enter into interest rate swap agreements to modify our exposure to interest rate movements and to manage our interest expense and rent expense 

market risk associated with our longterm fixed rate debt is the potential increase in fair value resulting from a decrease in interest rates at december 31 2009 our interest rate swap agreements effectively changed 3500 million of fixed rate debt with a fixed rate of 725 to liborbased floating rate debt and €10 billion of fixed rate debt with a fixed rate of 5625 to euriborbased floating rate debt we have cross currency swap agreements that effectively change €3000 million of the €10 billion floating euriborbased debt to floating liborbased debt see foreign currency exchange rate risk for further information the estimated fair value of our longterm fixed rate debt at december 31 2009 was 51 billion using quoted market prices where available or using the present value of expected future cash flows which incorporates risk profile the fair value of our associated interest rate swap and cross currency swap agreements including accrued interest was estimated to be an asset of 2291 million as of december 31 2009 based on the present value of expected future cash flows a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates at december 31 2009 would increase the fair value of our longterm fixed rate debt by approximately 954 million net of an increase in the fair value of the associated interest rate swap agreements 

market risk associated with our longterm floating rate debt is the potential increase in interest expense from an increase in interest rates a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase our 2010 interest expense by approximately 412 million assuming no change in exchange rates 

market risk associated with our operating lease for brilliance of the seas is the potential increase in rent expense from an increase in sterling libor rates as of january 2009 we have effectively changed 49 of the operating lease obligation from a floating rate to a fixed rate obligation with a weightedaverage rate of 476 through rate fixings with the lessor a hypothetical one percentage point increase in sterling libor rates would increase our 2010 rent expense by approximately 15 million based on the exchange rate at december 31 2009 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to our ship construction firm commitments denominated in euros we enter into eurodenominated forward contracts to manage this risk the estimated fair value of such eurodenominated forward contracts at december 31 2009 was estimated to be a liability of 33 million based on the present value of expected future cash flows at december 31 2009 approximately 90 of the aggregate cost of the ships was exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate a hypothetical 10 strengthening of the euro as of december 31 2009 assuming no changes in comparative interest rates would result in a 381 million increase in the united states dollar cost of the foreign currency denominated ship construction contracts exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate 

  

as discussed above we have cross currency swap agreements that effectively change €3000 million of floating euriborbased debt to 3891 million of floating liborbased debt at december 31 2009 see interest rate risk for further information the estimated fair value of these cross currency swap agreements including accrued interest at december 31 2009 was an asset of approximately 461 million based on the present value of expected future cash flows a hypothetical 10 strengthening of the euro as of december 31 2009 assuming no changes in comparative interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of the €3000 million of floating euriborbased debt by 301 million offset by an increase in the fair value of the cross currency swap agreements of 304 million 

also we consider our investments in foreign subsidiaries and foreign investments to be denominated in relatively stable currencies and of a longterm nature we partially address the exposure of our investments in foreign subsidiaries and foreign investments by denominating a portion of our debt in our subsidiaries’ and investments’ functional currencies generally euros specifically we have assigned debt of approximately €3468 million and €1429 million or approximately 4968 million and 2047 million as a hedge of our net investment in pullmantur and tui cruises respectively accordingly we have included approximately 25 million of foreigncurrency transaction losses in the foreign currency translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss at december 31 2009 a hypothetical 10 increase or decrease in the december 31 2009 foreign currency exchange rate would increase or decrease the fair value of our assigned debt by 571 million which would be offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the united states dollar value of our net investment 

our growing international business operations also subject us to an increasing level of foreign currency exchange risk movements in foreign currency exchange rates may affect the translated value of our earnings and cash flows associated with our international operations 

fuel price risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates to the consumption of fuel on our ships fuel cost net of the financial impact of fuel swap agreements as a percentage of our total revenues was approximately 102 in 2009 111 in 2008 and 89 in 2007 we use a range of instruments including fuel swap agreements and fuel call options to mitigate the financial impact of fluctuations in fuel prices as of december 31 2009 we had fuel swap agreements to pay fixed prices for fuel with an aggregate notional amount of approximately 6804 million maturing through 2012 the fuel swap agreements represent 51 of our projected 2010 fuel requirements 50 of our projected 2011 fuel requirements and 10 of our projected 2012 fuel requirements the estimated fair value of these contracts at december 31 2009 was estimated to be an asset of 1221 million as of december 31 2009 we had fuel call options with exercise prices of 12000 and 15000 per barrel for a total of 28 million barrels which mature between 2011 and 2012 the fuel call options represent 20 of our projected 2011 fuel requirements and 10 of our projected 2012 fuel requirements the estimated fair value of these contracts at december 31 2009 was estimated to be an asset of 100 million we estimate that a hypothetical 10 increase in our weightedaverage fuel price from that experienced during the year ended december 31 2009 would increase our 2010 fuel cost by approximately 299 million net of the impact of fuel swap agreements and fuel call options

north america represents the primary source of our cruise passengers and has experienced a compound annual growth rate of approximately 87 since 1970 from 2004 to 2008 north america has experienced a compound annual growth rate in cruise passengers of approximately 44 we estimate that north america was served by 132 ships with approximately 194000 berths at the beginning of 2004 and by 150 ships with approximately 257000 berths by the end of 2008 there are approximately 27 ships with an estimated 68000 berths that are expected to be placed in service in the north american cruise market between 2009 and 2012 

the following table details the growth in the global and north american cruise markets in terms of cruise passengers and estimated weightedaverage berths over the past five years 

 

  

  in an effort to penetrate untapped markets and diversify our customer base we have redeployed some of the ships in our royal caribbean international and celebrity cruises brands from the north american market to europe latin america and asia this redeployment has contributed to an increase in the growth of our global cruise brands outside of the north american market 

although the global and north american cruise markets have grown steadily over the past several years the recent weakening of the united states and other economies has significantly deteriorated consumer confidence and discretionary spending this has caused a global drop in demand for cruises and a resulting drop in cruise prices the longterm impact of these conditions on the continued growth of the cruise market will depend on the depth and duration of this worldwide economic downturn in addition the projected increase in capacity within the cruise industry from new cruise ships currently on order could produce additional pricing pressures within the industry see item 1a  risk factors  

we compete with a number of cruise lines however our principal competitors are carnival corporation  plc which owns among others aida cruises carnival cruise lines costa cruises cunard line holland america line po cruises and princess cruises and has a joint venture with orizonia corporation under which they operate iberocruceros disney cruise line msc cruises norwegian cruise line and oceania cruises cruise lines compete with other vacation alternatives such as landbased resort hotels and sightseeing destinations for consumers’ leisure time demand for such activities is influenced by political and general economic conditions companies within the vacation market are dependent on consumer discretionary spending although vacation spending is likely to be curtailed significantly in the midst of the current worldwide economic downturn we believe that cruising is perceived by consumers as a good value when compared to other vacation alternatives 

  

our ships operate worldwide and have itineraries that call on destinations in alaska asia australia the bahamas bermuda california canada the caribbean europe the galapagos islands hawaii mexico new england new zealand the panama canal and south america 

operating strategies 

our principal operating strategies are to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 manage operating expenditures and preserve cash and liquidity 

during the current worldwide economic downturn we are focused on maximizing the efficiency of our operating expenditures and preserving cash and liquidity during 2008 we announced the reduction in our workforce of approximately 400 shoreside positions and implemented a number of costsaving initiatives in an effort to reduce our operating costs to preserve liquidity we have discontinued our quarterly dividend commencing in the fourth quarter of 2008 curtailed our nonshipbuild capital expenditures and currently do not have plans to place further newbuild orders we believe these strategies will enhance our ability to fund our capital spending obligations and improve our balance sheet

fleet development and maintenance 

we currently have signed agreements with two shipyards providing for the construction of six new stateoftheart cruise ships scheduled to enter service between the third quarter of 2009 and the fourth quarter of 2012 these additions are expected to result in an increase in our passenger capacity of approximately 22200 berths by december 31 2012 or approximately 280 as compared to our capacity as of december 31 2008 it is possible that some of our older ships may be sold or retired during this time period thus reducing the size of our fleet we could also order new ships or purchase existing ships thereby further increasing our fleet size however we do not believe that current economic conditions warrant buying or ordering new ships other than what is currently on order 

the acquisition of the stateoftheart ships on order along with our maintenance programs on our existing fleet will provide us with the flexibility to deploy our ships among our brand portfolio and expand into growing international markets since our first fleet expansion program in 1988 we have increased our average ship size and number of available berths which has enabled us to achieve certain economies of scale 

in addition to our fleet development we place a strong focus on product innovation to drive new demand for our products and stimulate repeat business from our guests innovation of our products is achieved by introducing new concepts on our new ships and continuously making improvements to our existing fleet in order to offer guests a wider range of activities and amenities and to ensure consistency across our fleets we have revitalized some of our older ships to update and refresh their interiors and to incorporate signature brand elements renovations have included the addition of new balconies dining and entertainment options as well as refurbishments to staterooms and public areas

we maintain liability protection and indemnity insurance for each of our ships through either the united kingdom mutual steam ship assurance association bermuda limited or steamship mutual underwriting association bermuda limited our protection and indemnity liability insurance is done on a mutual basis and we are subject to additional premium calls in amounts based on claim records of all members of the mutual protection and indemnity association we are also subject to additional premium calls based on investment shortfalls experienced by the insurer 

we maintain war risk insurance for our ships including terrorist risk insurance on each ship through a norwegian war risk insurance organization this coverage includes coverage for physical damage to the ship which is not covered under the hull policies as a result of war exclusion clauses in such hull policies we also maintain protection and indemnity war risk coverage for risks that would be excluded by the rules of the indemnity insurance organizations subject to certain limitations consistent with most marine war risk policies under the terms of our war risk insurance coverage underwriters can give seven days notice to us that the policy will be canceled and reinstated at higher premium rates

we do not carry business interruption insurance for our ships nor our shoreside operations based on our evaluation of the risks involved and protective measures already in place as compared to the cost of insurance 

all insurance coverage is subject to certain limitations exclusions and deductible levels in addition in certain circumstances we coinsure a portion of these risks premiums charged by insurance carriers including carriers in the maritime insurance industry increase or decrease from time to time and tend to be cyclical in nature these cycles are impacted both by our own loss experience and by losses incurred in direct and reinsurance markets we historically have been able to obtain insurance coverage in amounts and at premiums we have deemed to be commercially acceptable no assurance can be given that affordable and secure insurance markets will be available to us in the future particularly for war risk insurance 

  

the athens convention relating to the carriage of passengers and their luggage by sea 1974 and the 1976 protocol to the athens convention are generally applicable to passenger ships the united states has not ratified the athens convention however with limited exceptions the 1976 athens convention protocol may be contractually enforced with respect to those of our cruises that do not call at a united states port the international maritime organization diplomatic conference agreed upon a new protocol to the athens convention on november 1 2002 the 2002 protocol which is not yet in force substantially increases the level of compulsory insurance which must be maintained by passenger ship operators no assurance can be given as to if or when the 2002 protocol will come into force if in force no assurance can be given that affordable and secure insurance markets will be available to provide the level of coverage required under the 2002 protocol

we own a number of registered trademarks related to the royal caribbean international celebrity cruises pullmantur azamara cruises and cdf croisières de france cruise brands the registered trademarks include the name “royal caribbean” and its crown and anchor logo the name “celebrity cruises” and its “x” logo the names “pullmantur cruises” and “pullmantur” and their logos the name “azamara cruises” and its logo the name “cdf croisières de france” and its logo and the names of various cruise ships we believe trademarks related to the royal caribbean international celebrity cruises and pullmantur cruises brands are widely recognized throughout the world and have considerable value we also believe trademarks related to our new brands azamara cruises and cdf croisières de france have received recent recognition throughout the world and have significant value 

regulation 

our ships are regulated by various international national state and local laws regulations and treaties in force in the jurisdictions in which they operate in addition our ships are registered in the bahamas malta or in the case of celebrity xpedition  ecuador each ship is subject to regulations issued by its country of registry including regulations issued pursuant to international treaties governing the safety of the ship and its passengers each country of registry conducts periodic inspections to verify compliance with these regulations ships operating out of united states ports are subject to inspection by the united states coast guard for compliance with international treaties and by the united states public health service for sanitary conditions our ships are also subject to similar inspections pursuant to the laws and regulations of various other countries our ships visit 

our ships are required to comply with international safety standards defined in the safety of life at sea convention the safety of life at sea convention standards are revised from time to time and the most recent modifications are being phased in through 2010 we do not anticipate that we will be required to make any material expenditures in order to comply with these rules 

we are required to obtain certificates from the united states federal maritime commission relating to our ability to satisfy liability in cases of nonperformance of obligations to passengers as well as casualty and personal injury pursuant to the united states federal maritime commission regulations we arrange through our insurers for the provision of guarantees aggregating 450 million for our shipoperating companies as a condition to obtaining the required certificates the united states federal maritime commission has proposed various revisions to the financial responsibility regulations which could require us to significantly increase the amount of our bonds and accordingly increase our costs of compliance 

we are also required by the united kingdom and other jurisdictions to establish our financial responsibility for any liability resulting from the nonperformance of our obligations to passengers from these jurisdictions in the united kingdom we are currently required by the united kingdom passenger shipping association to provide performance bonds totaling approximately £420 million we are also required to pay to the united kingdom civil aviation authority a nonrefundable tax of £1 per passenger 

we are subject to various united states and international laws and regulations relating to environmental protection under such laws and regulations we are prohibited from among other things discharging certain materials such as petrochemicals and plastics into the waterways we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures to comply with environmental laws and 

  

regulations from time to time environmental and other regulators consider more stringent regulations which may affect our operations and increase our compliance costs we believe that the impact of cruise ships on the global environment will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world and accordingly this will likely subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 

our ships are subject to the international maritime organization’s regulations under the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships the “marpol regulations” which impose limitations on the sulfur content of fuel used by ships operating worldwide the marpol regulations also provide for special emission control areas “ecas” to be established with more stringent limitations on sulfur emissions 

in 2008 the marpol regulations were amended the “amendment” to require reductions in sulfur emissions by reducing the maximum sulfur content in fuel oil that may be used in ecas to 10 by 2010 the amendment also introduced progressive reductions in nitrogen oxide emissions from both existing and new marine diesel engines by 2011 

compliance with the marpol regulations will increase our fuel and operating costs due to the higher cost of purchasing low sulfur fuel in addition compliance with the new standards under the amendment may require the development of new engine designs or exhaust gas treatment systems which may result in significant additional costs 

in 2010 a european union directive also regarding the use of low sulfur fuels for passenger ships becomes effective the directive places a 01 sulfur content limit on all marine fuels used by such ships while alongside in european union ports compliance with this directive will require us to use distillate fuels such as marine gas oil which will increase our fuel costs 

the international labour organization an agency of the united nations that develops worldwide employment standards has adopted a new consolidated maritime labour convention the “convention” the convention reflects standards and conditions to govern all aspects of crew management for all ships in international commerce including additional requirements not previously in effect the convention may be ratified in 2010 in which case it would enter into force in 2011 if ratified our crew costs may increase in order to comply with the convention 

we are required to obtain certificates from the united states coast guard relating to our ability to satisfy liability in cases of water pollution pursuant to united states coast guard regulations we arrange through our insurers for the provision of guarantees aggregating 3480 million as a condition to obtaining the required certificates 

we believe that we are in material compliance with all the regulations applicable to our ships and that we have all licenses necessary to conduct our business health safety security and financial responsibility issues are and we believe will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant government authorities in the united states and internationally from time to time various regulatory and legislative changes may be proposed that could impact our operations and would likely subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 

taxation of the company 

united states federal income tax 

the following discussion of the application of the united states federal income tax laws to us and our subsidiaries is based on the current provisions of the united states internal revenue code treasury department regulations administrative rulings and court decisions all of the foregoing is subject to change and any such change could affect the accuracy of this discussion 

application of section 883 of the internal revenue code 

we and our subsidiary celebrity cruises inc the operator of celebrity cruises and azamara cruises are foreign corporations engaged in a trade or business in the united states and our shipowning subsidiaries are foreign corporations that in many cases depending upon the itineraries of their ships receive income from sources within the united states under section 883 of the internal revenue code certain foreign corporations are not subject to united states income or branch profits tax on united states source income derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships including income from the leasing of such ships 

  

a foreign corporation will qualify for the benefits of section 883 if in relevant part 1 the foreign country in which the foreign corporation is organized grants an equivalent exemption to corporations organized in the united states and 2a more than 50 of the value of the corporation’s capital stock is owned directly or indirectly by individuals who are residents of a foreign country that grants such an equivalent exemption to corporations organized in the united states or b the stock of the corporation or the direct or indirect corporate parent thereof is “primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market” in the united states or another qualifying country such as norway in the opinion of our united states tax counsel drinker biddle  reath llp based on the representations and assumptions set forth in that opinion we celebrity cruises inc and our shipowning subsidiaries qualify for the benefits of section 883 because we and each of those subsidiaries are incorporated in liberia or malta which are qualifying countries and our common stock is primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market in the united states or norway if in the future 1 liberia no longer qualifies as an equivalent exemption jurisdiction and we do not reincorporate in a jurisdiction that does qualify for the exemption or 2 we fail to qualify as a publicly traded corporation we and all of our shipowning or operating subsidiaries that rely on section 883 for tax exemption on qualifying income would be subject to united states federal income tax on their united states source shipping income and income from activities incidental thereto 

we believe that most of our income and the income of our shipowning subsidiaries is derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships and therefore is exempt from taxation under section 883 in 2005 final regulations became effective under section 883 which among other things narrow somewhat the scope of activities that are considered by the internal revenue service to be incidental to the international operation of ships the activities listed in the regulations as not being incidental to the international operation of ships include income from the sale of air and land transportation shore excursions and pre and postcruise tours to the extent the income from these activities is earned from sources within the united states that income will be subject to united states taxation but the determination of the precise amount of such united states source income involves some uncertainties 

under certain circumstances changes in the identity residence or holdings of our direct or indirect shareholders could cause our common stock not to be “regularly traded on an established securities market” within the meaning of the regulations under section 883 to substantially reduce any such risk in may 2000 our articles of incorporation were amended to prohibit any person other than our two existing largest shareholders from owning directly or constructively as determined for purposes of section 883c3 of the internal revenue code and the regulations promulgated under it more than 49 of the relevant class or classes of our shares under liberian law this amendment may not be enforceable with respect to shares of common stock that were voted against the amendment or that were recorded as abstaining from the vote 

also it should be noted that section 883 has been the subject of legislative modifications in past years that have had the effect of limiting its availability to certain taxpayers and there can be no assurance that future legislation will not preclude us from obtaining the benefits of section 883 

taxation in the absence of an exemption under section 883 of the internal revenue code 

if we celebrity cruises inc or our shipowning subsidiaries were to fail to meet the requirements of section 883 of the internal revenue code or if the provision was repealed then as explained below such companies would be subject to united states income taxation on a portion of their income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships 

because we and celebrity cruises inc conduct a trade or business in the united states we and celebrity cruises inc would be taxable at regular corporate rates on our separate company taxable income ie without regard to the income of our shipowning subsidiaries from united states sources which includes 100 of income if any from transportation that begins and ends in the united states not including possessions of the united states 50 of income from transportation that either begins or ends in the united states and no income from transportation that neither begins nor ends in the united states the legislative history of the transportation income source rules suggests that a cruise that begins and ends in a united states port but that calls on more than one foreign port will derive united states source income only from the first and last legs of such cruise this conclusion is not free from doubt however because there are no regulations or other internal revenue service interpretations of the above rules in addition if any of our earnings and profits effectively connected with our united states trade or business were withdrawn or were deemed to have been withdrawn from our united states trade or business those withdrawn amounts would be subject to a “branch profits” tax 

  

at the rate of 30 the amount of such earnings and profits would be equal to the aforesaid united states source income with certain generally minor adjustments less income taxes we and celebrity cruises inc would also be potentially subject to tax on portions of certain interest paid by us at rates of up to 30 

if section 883 were not available to our shipowning subsidiaries each such subsidiary would be subject to a special 4 tax on its united states source gross transportation income if any each year because it does not have a fixed place of business in the united states and its income is derived from the leasing of a ship such united states source gross transportation income may be determined under any reasonable method including ratios of days traveling directly to or from united states ports to total days traveling or of the lessee’s united states source gross income from the ship as determined under the source rules discussed in the preceding paragraph and subject to the assumptions and qualifications set forth therein to the lessee’s total gross income from the ship 

maltese income tax 

our pullmantur ship owneroperator subsidiaries qualify as licensed shipping organizations in malta no maltese income tax is charged on the income derived from shipping activities of a licensed shipping organization instead a licensed shipping organization is liable to pay a tonnage tax based on the net tonnage of the ship or ships registered under the relevant provisions of the merchant shipping act a company qualifies as a shipping organization if it engages in qualifying activities and it obtains a license from the registrargeneral to enable it to carry on such activities qualifying activities include but are not limited to the ownership operation under charter or otherwise administration and management of a ship or ships registered as a maltese ship in terms of the merchant shipping act and the carrying on of all ancillary financial security and commercial activities in connection therewith 

our maltese operations that do not qualify as licensed shipping organizations which are not considered significant remain subject to normal maltese corporate income tax 

united kingdom income tax 

the brilliance of the seas is operated by a company that is strategically and commercially managed in the united kingdom which has elected to be subject to the united kingdom tonnage tax regime “uk tonnage tax” companies subject to uk tonnage tax pay a corporate tax on a notional profit determined with reference to the net tonnage of qualifying vessels normal united kingdom corporate income tax is not chargeable on the relevant shipping profits of a qualifying uk tonnage tax company the requirements for a company to qualify for the uk tonnage tax regime include being subject to united kingdom corporate income tax operating qualifying ships which are strategically and commercially managed in the united kingdom and fulfilling a seafarer training requirement 

relevant shipping profits include income from the operation of qualifying ships and from shipping related activities our united kingdom income from nonshipping activities which do not qualify under the uk tonnage tax regime and which are not considered significant remain subject to united kingdom corporate income tax 

state taxation 

we celebrity cruises inc and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various united states state income taxes which are generally imposed on each state’s portion of the united states source income subject to federal income taxes additionally the state of alaska subjects an allocated portion of the total income of companies doing business in alaska and certain other affiliated companies to alaska corporate state income taxes and also imposes a 33 tax on income from onboard gambling activities conducted in alaska waters this did not have a material impact to our results of operations for all years presented 

  

other taxation 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to income tax in the united states or other jurisdictions on income that does not qualify for exemption under section 883 or tonnage tax regimes the tax on such income was not material to our results of operations for all years presented

 item 1a risk factors tableend the risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k are important factors among others that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historical results it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently this list should not be considered a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a cautionary note regarding forwardlooking statements 

the adverse impact of the continuing worldwide economic downturn on the demand for cruises could adversely impact our operating results cash flows and financial condition 

the demand for cruises is affected by international national and local economic conditions the current worldwide economic downturn has had an adverse effect on vacationers’ discretionary income and consumer confidence which has resulted in cruise booking slowdowns decreased cruise prices and lower onboard revenues for us and for the others in the cruise industry we cannot predict the extent or duration of this downturn or the timing or strength of a subsequent economic recovery however if the downturn continues for an extended period of time or worsens we could experience a prolonged period of booking slowdowns depressed cruise prices and reduced onboard revenues this could adversely impact our operating results cash flows and financial condition including the impairment of the value of our ships goodwill and other intangible assets 

we may not be able to obtain sufficient financing or capital for our needs or may not be able to do so on terms that are acceptable or consistent with our expectations 

to fund our capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments we have historically relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations drawdowns under available credit facilities the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the sale of equity or debt securities in private or public securities markets the decrease in consumer cruise spending as a result of the current economic environment is adversely impacting our cash flows from operations the disruption in the credit markets has resulted in a lack of liquidity worldwide which may affect our ability to successfully raise capital or to do so on acceptable terms these factors may prevent us from having sufficient available capital or financing to meet our needs or to do so on acceptable terms during 2008 our credit rating was lowered from bbb with a negative outlook to bb with a negative outlook by standard and poor’s in january 2009 standard and poor’s placed our credit rating on credit watch with negative implications in addition our credit rating was lowered from ba1 with a stable outlook to ba2 with a negative outlook by moody’s there is no assurance that our credit ratings will not be lowered further the lowering of our credit ratings may increase our cost of financing and can make it more difficult for us to access the financial markets see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2008 we had two ships of a new oasisclass designated for royal caribbean international and four solsticeclass ships designated for celebrity cruises on order we expect to take delivery of celebrity equinox and oasis of the seas in july 2009 and november 2009 respectively we have committed financing for all of the solsticeclass ships and have commitments for government financing guarantees from finnvera the export credit agency of finland for 80 of the financed amount of the oasisclass ships  we must still secure financing for oasis of the seas and allure of the seas and although we believe that we will be able to do so there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so or that we will be able to do so on acceptable terms 

the impact of disruptions in the global financial markets may affect the ability of our counterparties and others to perform their obligations to us 

the economic events over the past several months including recent failures of financial service companies and the related liquidity crisis have disrupted the capital and credit markets these disruptions could cause our counterparties and others to breach their obligations to us under our contracts with them this could include failures of banks or other financial service companies to fund required borrowings under our loan agreements or to pay us amounts that may become due under our derivative contracts for hedging of fuel prices interest rates and foreign currencies or other agreements if this occurs it may have a negative impact on our cash flows including our ability to meet our obligations results of operations and financial condition 

  

the increase in capacity resulting from delivery of newbuilds currently on order within the cruise industry could further adversely impact the demand for cruises or cruise pricing 

a total of 34 new ships are on order for delivery through 2012 in the cruise industry six of which are ours the current worldwide economic downturn and tighter credit markets have already resulted in a weaker demand environment which has led to lower cruise prices and lower onboard purchases all of which have adversely affected our revenues the further growth in capacity from these new ships without an increase in the cruise industry’s share of the vacation market could further depress cruise prices compounding with the current adverse economic environment to hinder our ability for a quick recovery 

we may lose business to competitors throughout the vacation market  

we operate in the vacation market and cruising is one of many alternatives for people choosing a vacation we therefore risk losing business not only to other cruise lines but also to other vacation operators which provide other leisure options including hotels resorts and package holidays and tours 

we face significant competition from other cruise lines both on the basis of cruise pricing and also in terms of the nature of ships and services we offer to passengers our principal competitors within the cruise vacation industry include carnival corporation  plc which owns among others aida cruises carnival cruise lines costa cruises cunard line holland america line po cruises and princess cruises and has a joint venture with orizonia corporation under which they operate iberocruceros disney cruise line msc cruises norwegian cruise line and oceania cruises 

in the event that we do not compete effectively with other vacation alternatives and cruise companies our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

fears of terrorist and pirate attacks war and other hostilities and the spread of contagious diseases could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

events such as terrorist and pirate attacks war and other hostilities and the resulting political instability travel restrictions the spread of contagious diseases and concerns over safety health and security aspects of traveling have had and could have in the future a significant adverse impact on demand and pricing in the travel and vacation industry these events could also impact our ability to source qualified crew from throughout the world at competitive costs and therefore increase our shipboard employee costs 

incidents or adverse publicity concerning the cruise vacation industry or unusual weather conditions could affect our reputation and harm our future sales and results of operations 

the operation of cruise ships involves the risk of accidents illnesses and other incidents which may bring into question passenger safety health security and vacation satisfaction and create a perception that cruising is more dangerous than other vacation alternatives incidents involving cruise ships adverse media publicity concerning the cruise vacation industry or unusual weather patterns or natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes could impact demand and consequently have an adverse impact on our results of operations and on future industry performance 

environmental health and safety financial responsibility and other maritime regulations could affect operations and increase operating costs 

the united states and various state and foreign government or regulatory agencies have enacted or are considering new environmental regulations or policies such as requiring the use of low sulfur fuels increasing fuel efficiency requirements or further restricting emissions that could adversely impact the cruise vacation industry some environmental groups have also lobbied for more stringent regulation of cruise ships and have generated negative publicity about the cruise vacation industry and its environmental impact in addition we are subject to various international national state and local laws regulations and treaties that govern among 

  

other things safety standards applicable to our ships health and sanitary standards applicable to our passengers security standards on board our ships and at the shipport interface areas and financial responsibilities to our passengers these issues are and we believe will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world this could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise ships that would subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 

conducting business internationally may result in increased costs and other risks 

we operate our business internationally and plan to continue to develop our international presence operating internationally exposes us to a number of risks examples include unstable local political or economic conditions and risk of increases in duties and taxes as well as changes in laws and policies affecting cruising vacation or maritime businesses or governing the operations of foreignbased companies additional risks include currency fluctuations interest rate movements imposition of trade barriers and restrictions on repatriation of earnings if we are unable to address these risks adequately our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we have ship construction contracts which are denominated in euros while we have entered into eurodenominated forward contracts to manage a portion of the currency risk associated with these ship construction contracts we are exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate for the portion of the ship construction contracts that has not been hedged if the shipyard is unable to perform under the related ship construction contract any foreign currency hedges that were entered into to manage the currency risk would need to be terminated termination of these contracts could result in a significant loss 

our attempts to expand our business into new markets may not be successful 

historically our focus has been to serve the north american cruise market which continues to be our primary source of cruise passengers we have expanded our focus to increase our international passenger sourcing most recently in the brazilian and australian markets expansion into new markets requires significant levels of investment there can be no assurance that these markets will develop as anticipated or that we will have success in these markets and if we do not we may be unable to recover our investment which could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

ship construction delays or mechanical faults may result in cancellation of cruises or unscheduled drydocks and repairs and thus adversely affect our results of operations 

we depend on shipyards to construct and deliver our cruise ships on a timely basis and in good working order the sophisticated nature of building a ship involves risks delays or mechanical faults in ship construction have in the past and may in the future result in delays or cancellation of cruises or necessitate unscheduled drydocks and repairs of ships we have for example experienced mechanical problems with the pod propulsion units on certain ships and there can be no assurance that we will not experience such problems in the future these events and any related adverse publicity could result in lost revenue increased operating expenses or both and thus adversely affect our results of operations 

the current worldwide economic downturn is resulting in financial difficulties for shipyards and their subcontractors this may cause or result in delivery delays ship cancellations or increases in shipbuilding costs that could adversely affect our results of operations 

the current downturn in the worldwide economy is causing a loss of business for shipyards and their subcontractors which could result in financial difficulties liquidations or closures these events could adversely affect the timely delivery or costs of new ships or the ability of shipyards to repair and refurbish our existing fleet in accordance with our needs or expectations delivery delays and cancelled deliveries can adversely affect our results of operations as can any constraints on our ability to repair and maintain our ships on a timely basis in addition the cruise shipyard industry is undergoing consolidation which could result in stronger bargaining power on the part of the shipyards and thus higher prices for our future ship orders 

  

our operating costs and taxes could increase due to market forces and economic or geo political factors beyond our control 

our operating costs including fuel food payroll airfare for our shipboard personnel insurance and security costs are subject to increases due to market forces and economic or political instability or other factors beyond our control increases in these operating costs could adversely affect our profitability in addition the recent volatility in the price of fuel is making our ability to predict fuel prices extremely difficult united states state and local authorities as well as foreign authorities periodically consider increases in taxes any such tax increases could also cause an increase in our costs 

unavailability of ports of call may adversely affect our results of operations  

we believe that port destinations are a major reason why passengers choose to go on a particular cruise or on a cruise vacation the availability of ports is affected by a number of factors including but not limited to existing capacity constraints security concerns adverse weather conditions and natural disasters financial limitations on port development exclusivity arrangements that ports may have with our competitors local governmental regulations and local community concerns about port development and other adverse impacts on their communities from additional tourists any limitations on the availability of our ports of call or on the availability of shore excursion and other service providers at such ports could adversely affect our results of operations 

price increases for commercial airline service for our passengers or major changes or reduction in commercial airline service could adversely impact the demand for cruises and undermine our ability to provide reasonably priced vacation packages to our passengers 

many of our passengers depend on scheduled commercial airline services to transport them to or from the ports where our cruises embark or disembark increases in the price of airfare would increase the overall price of the cruise vacation to our passengers which may adversely impact demand for our cruises in addition changes in the availability of commercial airline services could adversely affect our passenger’s ability to obtain airfare as well as our ability to fly our passengers to or from our cruise ships which could adversely affect our results of operations 

changes or disruptions to external distribution channels for our guest bookings could adversely affect our results of operations 

we rely on travel agencies to generate the majority of bookings for our ships if the current worldwide economic downturn continues for an extended period of time or worsens these agencies could be adversely impacted and significant disruptions or contractions could occur to these businesses this could reduce the distribution channels available for us to market and sell our cruises if this were to occur it could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

the loss of key personnel or our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel could adversely affect our results of operations 

our success depends in large part on the skills and contributions of key executives and other employees and on our ability to recruit and retain high quality employees we must continue to recruit retain and motivate management and other employees sufficient to maintain our current business and support our projected growth a loss of key employees could adversely affect our results of operations 

a change in our tax status under the united states internal revenue code or other jurisdictions may have adverse effects on our income  

we and a number of our subsidiaries are foreign corporations that derive income from a united states trade or business andor from sources within the united states drinker biddle  reath llp our united states tax counsel has delivered to us an opinion based on certain representations and assumptions set forth in it to the effect that this income to the extent derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships is exempt from united states income tax pursuant to section 883 of the internal revenue code we believe that most of our income including that of our subsidiaries is derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships 

  

it should also be noted that the provisions of section 883 are subject to change at any time by legislation moreover changes could occur in the future with respect to the identity residence or holdings of our direct or indirect shareholders or relevant foreign tax laws that could affect our eligibility for the section 883 exemption accordingly there can be no assurance that we will continue to be exempt from united states income tax on united states source shipping income in the future if we were not entitled to the benefit of section 883 we and our subsidiaries would be subject to united states taxation on a portion of the income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships which would reduce our net income see taxation of the company above for a discussion of such taxation in the absence of an exemption under section 883 

finally changes in the income tax laws affecting our operations in malta the united kingdom or elsewhere could result in higher income taxes being charged against our operations resulting in lower net income 

we are controlled by principal shareholders that have the power to determine our policies management and actions requiring shareholder approval 

as of february 12 2009 a wilhelmsen as a norwegian corporation indirectly owned by members of the wilhelmsen family of norway owned approximately 201 of our common stock and cruise associates a bahamian general partnership indirectly owned by various trusts primarily for the benefit of certain members of the pritzker family and a trust primarily for the benefit of certain members of the ofer family owned approximately 156 of our common stock a sale of shares by a wilhelmsen as or cruise associates could cause a drop in our share prices 

a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates are parties to a shareholders’ agreement and have the power to determine among other things our policies the persons who will be our directors and officers and actions requiring shareholder approval the shareholders’ agreement provides that our board of directors will consist of four nominees of a wilhelmsen as four nominees of cruise associates and our chief executive officer 

during the term of the shareholders’ agreement certain corporate actions require the approval of at least one director nominated by a wilhelmsen as and one director nominated by cruise associates our principal shareholders are not prohibited from engaging in a business that may compete with our business subject to certain exceptions if any person other than a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates our two principal shareholders acquires ownership of more than 30 of our common stock and our two principal shareholders in the aggregate own less of our common stock than such person and do not collectively have the right to elect or to designate for election at least a majority of the board of directors we may be obligated to prepay indebtedness outstanding under the majority of our credit facilities which we may be unable to replace on similar terms if this were to occur it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity and operations 

we are not a united states corporation and our shareholders may be subject to the uncertainties of a foreign legal system in protecting their interests 

our corporate affairs are governed by our restated articles of incorporation and bylaws and by the business corporation act of liberia the provisions of the business corporation act of liberia resemble provisions of the corporation laws of a number of states in the united states however while most states have a fairly well developed body of case law interpreting their respective corporate statutes there are very few judicial cases in liberia interpreting the business corporation act of liberia as such the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under liberian law are not as clearly established as the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in certain united states jurisdictions for example the right of shareholders to bring a derivative action in liberian courts may be more limited than in united states jurisdictions there may also be practical difficulties for shareholders attempting to bring suit in liberia and liberian courts may or may not recognize and enforce foreign judgments thus our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests with respect to actions by management directors or controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a united states jurisdiction 

  

litigation enforcement actions fines or penalties could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations andor damage our reputation 

our business is subject to various united states and international laws and regulations that could lead to enforcement actions fines civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims and damages in addition improper conduct by our employees or agents could damage our reputation andor lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties including substantial monetary fines in certain circumstances it may not be economical to defend against such matters andor a legal strategy may not ultimately result in us prevailing in a matter such events could lead to an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend in january 2006 a purported class action lawsuit was filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york alleging that we infringed rights in copyrighted works and other intellectual property by presenting performances on our cruise ships without securing the necessary licenses the suit seeks payment of damages disgorgement of profits and a permanent injunction against future infringement in april 2006 we filed a motion to sever and transfer the case to the united states district court for the southern district of florida the motion is pending we are not able at this time to estimate the impact of this proceeding 

we have a lawsuit pending in the circuit court for miamidade county florida against rolls royce coproducer of the mermaid podpropulsion system on millenniumclass ships for the recurring mermaid pod failures alstom power conversion the 

  

other coproducer of the podpropulsion system settled out of this suit in january 2006 for 380 million in december 2008 rolls royce filed its answer to our lawsuit denying the allegations and asserting various affirmative defenses at the same time rolls royce counterclaimed that we engaged in a civil conspiracy with alstom power conversion and its various affiliates “alstom” that we tortiously interfered with rolls royce’s joint venture agreement with alstom and that we caused alstom to breach its fiduciary obligations owing to rolls royce under the joint venture agreement rolls royce alleges damages against us in excess of 1000 million for these claims they also brought a thirdparty complaint against alstom and are seeking indemnification and contribution from them we have moved to dismiss rolls royce’s counterclaims on the basis that they are frivolous unfounded and untimely we are not able at this time to estimate the outcome of the rolls royce proceeding although we believe we have meritorious claims against rolls royce and meritorious defenses to the counterclaims both of which we intend to vigorously pursue 

in july 2006 a purported class action lawsuit was filed in the united states district court for the central district of california alleging that we failed to timely pay crew wages and failed to pay proper crew overtime the suit seeks payment of damages including penalty wages under the united states seaman’s wage act and equitable relief damages under the california unfair competition law in december 2006 the district court granted our motion to dismiss the claim and held that it should be arbitrated pursuant to the arbitration provision in royal caribbean’s collective bargaining agreement in november 2008 the united states ninth circuit court of appeals affirmed the district court’s finding and plaintiffs subsequent request for rehearing and rehearing en banc was denied we are not able at this time to estimate the impact of this proceeding 

the miami district office of the united states equal employment opportunity commission “eeoc” has alleged that certain of our shipboard employment practices do not comply with united states employment laws in june 2007 the eeoc proposed payment of monetary sanctions and certain remedial actions following discussions with the eeoc regarding this matter the eeoc informed us that they transferred the matter to its legal unit for litigation review to date no legal proceedings have been initiated we do not believe that this matter will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

the florida attorney general’s office is investigating whether there is or has been a violation of state or federal antitrust laws in connection with the setting by us and other cruise line operators of fuel supplements in 2007 we are cooperating with the attorney general’s office in connection with this investigation and are not able at this time to estimate the impact of this investigation

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america see note 1 general and note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  certain of our accounting policies are deemed “critical” as they require management’s highest degree of judgment estimates and assumptions we have discussed these accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors we believe our most critical accounting policies are as follows 

ship accounting 

our ships represent our most significant assets and are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation depreciation of ships is generally computed net of a 15 projected residual value using the straightline method over estimated service lives of primarily 30 years improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized as additions to the ship and depreciated over the improvements’ estimated useful lives the estimated cost and accumulated depreciation of replaced or refurbished ship components are written off and any resulting losses are recognized in cruise operating expenses repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred we use the deferral method to account for drydocking costs under the deferral method drydocking costs incurred are deferred and charged to expense on a straightline basis over the period to the next scheduled drydock deferred drydock costs consist of the costs to drydock the vessel and other costs incurred in connection with the drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessel’s class certification see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

our service life and residual value estimates take into consideration the impact of anticipated technological changes longterm cruise and vacation market conditions and historical useful lives of similarlybuilt ships in addition we take into consideration our estimates of the average useful lives of the ships’ major component systems such as hull superstructure main electric engines and cabins given the very large and complex nature of our ships our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain we do not have cost segregation studies performed to specifically componentize our ship systems therefore we estimate the costs of component systems based principally on general and technical information known about major ship component systems and their lives and our knowledge of the cruise vacation industry we do not identify and track depreciation by ship component systems but instead utilize these estimates to determine the net cost basis of assets replaced or refurbished 

  

we believe we have made reasonable estimates for ship accounting purposes however should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimates of ship service lives or projected residual values depreciation expense could be materially higher or lower if circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making determinations as to whether ship improvements should be capitalized the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance costs could increase partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense if we had reduced our estimated average 30year ship service life by one year depreciation expense for 2008 would have increased by approximately 314 million if our ships were estimated to have no residual value depreciation expense for 2008 would have increased by approximately 901 million 

valuation of longlived assets goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

we review our ships and other longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of these assets based on our estimate of their undiscounted future cash flows if estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of an asset an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the asset’s estimated fair value and its carrying value 

we determine fair value based on quoted market prices in active markets if available if active markets are not available we base fair value on independent appraisals sales price negotiations and projected future cash flows discounted at a rate determined by management to be commensurate with the business risk the estimation of fair value utilizing discounted forecasted cash flows includes numerous uncertainties which require significant judgment when making assumptions of revenues operating costs marketing selling and administrative expenses interest rates cruise vacation industry competition and general economic and business conditions among other factors 

we review goodwill trademarks and tradenames which are our most significant indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate but at least annually the impairment review for goodwill consists of a two step process of first determining the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it to the carrying value of the net assets allocated to the reporting unit if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value no further analysis or writedown of goodwill is required if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of its net assets the implied fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all its underlying assets and liabilities including both recognized and unrecognized tangible and intangible assets based on their fair value if necessary goodwill is then written down to its implied fair value the impairment review for indefinitelife intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess if the fair value exceeds its carrying amount the indefinitelife intangible asset is not considered impaired 

the fair value of a reporting unit and an indefinitelife intangible asset is based on quoted market prices if available quoted market prices are often not available for individual reporting units and for indefinitelife intangible assets accordingly we base the fair value of a reporting unit and an indefinitelife intangible asset on an expected present value technique 

we performed the annual impairment review for goodwill during the fourth quarter of 2008 we determined the fair value of our two reporting units which include goodwill royal caribbean international and pullmantur using a probabilityweighted discounted cash flow model the principal assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model are projected operating results weighted average cost of capital and terminal value cash flows were calculated using our 2009 projected operating results as a base to that base we added future years’ cash flows assuming multiple revenue and expense scenarios that reflect the impact on each reporting unit of different global economic environments beyond 2009 

we discounted the projected cash flows using rates specific to each reporting unit based on their respective weighted average cost of capital based on the probabilityweighted discounted cash flows of each reporting unit we determined the fair values of royal caribbean international and pullmantur exceeded their carrying values therefore we did not proceed to step two of the impairment analysis and we do not consider goodwill to be impaired 

we also performed the annual impairment review of our trademarks and trade names during the fourth quarter of 2008 using a discounted cash flow model and the relieffromroyalty method the royalty rate used is based on comparable royalty agreements in 

  

the tourism and hospitality industry we used the same discount rate used in valuing the pullmantur reporting unit based on the discounted cash flow model we determined the fair value of our trademarks and trade names exceeded their carrying value 

in performing our asset impairment analysis we considered the fact that at december 31 2008 the book value of our shareholders’ equity exceeded our market capitalization however we did not consider this to be determinative especially in light of recent negative market conditions the turmoil in the credit and capital markets and the resulting weakened demand environment 

the estimation of fair value utilizing discounted expected future cash flows includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of expected revenues operating costs marketing selling and administrative expenses interest rates ship additions and retirements as well as assumptions regarding the cruise vacation industry competition and general economic and business conditions among other factors if there is a material change in the assumptions used in our determination of fair values or if there is a material change in the conditions or circumstances influencing fair value we could be required to recognize a material impairment charge 

contingencies — litigation 

on an ongoing basis we assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss if any can be made in assessing probable losses we take into consideration estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries if any we accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recoveries it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made 

terminology 

our revenues are seasonal based on demand for cruises demand is strongest for cruises during the northern hemisphere summer months and holidays 

our revenues consist of the following 

passenger ticket revenues consist of revenue recognized from the sale of passenger tickets and the sale of air transportation to and from our ships 

onboard and other revenues consist primarily of revenues from the sale of goods andor services onboard our ships not included in passenger ticket prices cancellation fees sales of vacation protection insurance pre and postcruise tours pullmantur’s landbased tours and hotel and air packages also included are revenues we receive from independent third party concessionaires that pay us a percentage of their revenues in exchange for the right to provide selected goods andor services onboard our ships 

our cruise operating expenses consist of the following 

commissions transportation and other expenses consist of those costs directly associated with passenger ticket revenues including travel agent commissions air and other transportation expenses port costs that vary with passenger head counts and related credit card fees 

onboard and other expenses consist of the direct costs associated with onboard and other revenues these costs include the cost of products sold onboard our ships vacation protection insurance premiums costs associated with pre and postcruise tours and related credit card fees these costs also include minimal costs associated with concession revenues as the costs are mostly incurred by thirdparty concessionaires 

payroll and related expenses consist of costs for shipboard personnel 

  

food expenses include food costs for both passengers and crew 

fuel expenses include fuel and related delivery and storage costs including the financial impact of fuel swap agreements 

other operating expenses consist primarily of operating costs such as repairs and maintenance port costs that do not vary with passenger head counts vessel operating lease costs costs associated with pullmantur’s landbased tours vessel related insurance and entertainment 

we do not allocate payroll and related costs food costs fuel costs or other operating costs to the expense categories attributable to passenger ticket revenues or onboard and other revenues since they are incurred to provide the total cruise vacation experience 

nongaap financial measures 

available passenger cruise days “apcd” are our measurement of capacity and represent double occupancy per cabin multiplied by the number of cruise days for the period we use this measure to perform capacity and rate analysis to identify our main noncapacity drivers which cause our cruise revenue and expenses to vary 

gross cruise costs represent the sum of total cruise operating expenses plus marketing selling and administrative expenses 

gross yields represent total revenues per apcd 

net cruise costs represent gross cruise costs excluding commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses each of which is described above under the terminology heading in measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income we believe changes in net cruise costs to be the most relevant indicator of our performance a reconciliation of historical gross cruise costs to net cruise costs is provided below under summary of historical results of operations  we have not provided a quantitative reconciliation of projected gross cruise costs to projected net cruise costs due to the significant uncertainty in projecting the costs deducted to arrive at this measure accordingly we do not believe that reconciling information for such projected figures would be meaningful 

net debttocapital is a ratio which represents total longterm debt including current portion of longterm debt less cash and cash equivalents “net debt” divided by the sum of net debt and total shareholders’ equity we believe net debt and net debttocapital along with total longterm debt and shareholders’ equity are useful measures of our capital structure a reconciliation of historical debttocapital to net debttocapital is provided below under summary of historical results of operations 

net revenues represent total revenues less commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses each of which is described under the terminology heading 

net yields represent net revenues per apcd we utilize net revenues and net yields to manage our business on a daytoday basis as we believe that it is the most relevant measure of our pricing performance because it reflects the cruise revenues earned by us net of our most significant variable costs which are commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses a reconciliation of historical gross yields to net yields is provided below under summary of historical results of operations  we have not provided a quantitative reconciliation of projected gross yields to projected net yields due to the significant uncertainty in projecting the costs deducted to arrive at this measure accordingly we do not believe that reconciling information for such projected figures would be meaningful 

occupancy in accordance with cruise vacation industry practice is calculated by dividing passenger cruise days by apcd a percentage in excess of 100 indicates that three or more passengers occupied some cabins 

  

passenger cruise days represent the number of passengers carried for the period multiplied by the number of days of their respective cruises 

the use of certain significant nongaap measures such as net yields and net cruise costs allow us to perform capacity and rate analysis to separate the impact of known capacity changes from other less predictable changes which affect our business we believe these nongaap measures provide expanded insight to measure revenue and cost performance in addition to the standard united states gaap based financial measures there are no specific rules or regulations for determining nongaap measures and as such there exists the possibility that they may not be comparable to other companies within the industry 

executive overview 

we have seen a dramatic change in our operating environment during the past several months the current worldwide economic downturn and the meltdown of the global credit and capital markets have resulted in significant deterioration in consumer confidence and spending in addition the current disruption and tightening of the credit and capital markets may make it more difficult for us to secure financing or to raise additional capital or to do so on acceptable terms we are starting to experience significant compression in our booking window and forward bookings are lagging behind levels achieved during the last few years as consumers are delaying their purchase decisions the extent and duration of this worldwide economic downturn is uncertain forecasting demand in 2009 is extremely difficult and we expect this difficult environment to continue at least through 2009 as a result we expect 2009 net yields to decrease in the range of 9 to 13 compared to 2008 

the current economic environment has also led to more dramatic levels of volatility in fuel prices and foreign exchange rates which have become extremely volatile with significant daily or even hourly price fluctuations for planning purposes we do not forecast future fuel prices or exchange rates but instead use current spot prices for calculation purposes 

in an effort to offset the impact of the weaker demand environment we have increased our focus on cost reductions and on preserving cash and liquidity the cost cutting initiatives we announced in july 2008 are on track to produce the anticipated savings and we have implemented a number of new initiatives including the targeting of synergies and capturing deflationary opportunities from our vendors as a result of these initiatives we expect a reduction in our 2009 net cruise costs in the range of 7 to 9 per apcd compared to 2008 approximately 2 percentage points of this decrease relates to reductions in the price of fuel in 2009 

we have also discontinued our quarterly dividend commencing in the fourth quarter of 2008 curtailed our nonshipbuild capital expenditures and currently do not have plans to place further newbuild ship orders we are also exploring other activities to improve our liquidity we believe these strategies will enhance our ability to better fund our capital spending obligations and improve our balance sheet 

while cutting costs throughout the organization we have not altered our strategy of substantially growing our sourcing of passengers outside of north america we continue to increase our investments in growth outside of north america with the goal of diversifying our sources and increasing our opportunities for revenue growth 

we have four solsticeclass vessels under construction in germany all of which have committed bank financing arrangements and include financing guarantees from hermes euler hermes kreditrersicherungs ag the export credit agency of the german government for 95 of the financed amount we also have two oasisclass vessels under construction in finland each of which has commitments for financing guarantees from finnvera the export credit agency of finland for 80 of the financed amount we are working with the relevant export credit agencies and various financial institutions to obtain committed financing for oasis of the seas  this includes exploring opportunities to increase the guarantee level and obtain partial funding support from the relevant export credit agencies although we believe that we will secure committed financing for these ships before their delivery dates there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so or that we will do so on acceptable terms 

  

summary of historical results of operations 

although the operating environment has deteriorated since september 2008 total revenues increased 62 to 65 billion from total revenues of 61 billion for 2007 primarily due to a 52 increase in capacity and a 10 increase in gross yields net yields increased by approximately 05 compared to 2007 the increase in net yields was primarily due to an increase in ticket prices partially offset by a decrease in onboard and other revenues the increase in total revenues was partially offset by an increase in expenses primarily due to the increase in fuel and to a lesser extent payroll and related expenses in addition we recorded a onetime litigation gain of approximately 176 million related to the settlement of our pending case against pentair water treatment oh company formerly known as essef corporation as a result our net income was 5737 million or 268 per share on a diluted basis for 2008 compared to 6034 million or 282 per share on a diluted basis for 2007

outlook 

on january 29 2009 we announced the following guidance for the full year and first quarter of 2009 

full year 2009 

we expected net yields to decrease in the range of 9 to 13 compared to 2008 

we expected net cruise costs per apcd to decrease in the range of 7 to 9 compared to 2008 excluding fuel we expected net cruise costs per apcd to decrease in the range of 5 to 7 compared to 2008 

we do not forecast fuel prices and our cost calculation for fuel is based on current “atthepump” prices net of any hedging impacts if fuel prices for the full year 2009 remain at the level of january 29 2009 fuel expenses for the full year 2009 would be approximately 5800 million for the full year 2009 our fuel expense is approximately 47 hedged assuming our fuel prices correlate with the movement in the price of wti a 10 change in the wti price per barrel would result in a change in our fuel costs of approximately 460 million for the full year 2009 after taking into account existing hedges 

we expected a 67 increase in capacity in 2009 primarily driven by a full year of celebrity solstice  which entered service in november 2008 a full year of independence of the sea s which entered service in may 2008 the addition of celebrity equinox  which will enter service during the third quarter of 2009 and the addition of oasis of the seas which will enter service in the fourth quarter of 2009 

depreciation and amortization expenses were expected to be in the range of 5430 million to 5630 million and interest expense was expected to be in the range of 3200 million to 3400 million 

based on the expectations contained in this outlook section and assuming that fuel prices remain at the level of the january 29 2009 “atthepump” prices we expected full year 2009 earnings per share to be around 140 

our outlook has remained essentially unchanged since our announcement on january 29 2009 

first quarter 2009 

as announced on january 29 2009 we expected net yields will decrease in the range of 14 to 16 compared to 2008 

we expected net cruise costs per apcd to decrease in the range of 4 to 6 compared to 2008 excluding fuel we expected net cruise costs per apcd to decrease in the range of 5 to 7 compared to 2008 

we do not forecast fuel prices and our cost calculation for fuel is based on current “atthepump” prices net of any hedging impacts if fuel prices for the first quarter of 2009 remain at the level of january 29 2009 fuel expenses for the first quarter of 2009 would be approximately 1650 million for the first quarter of 2009 our fuel expense is approximately 58 hedged assuming our fuel prices correlate with the movement in the price of wti a 10 change in the wti price per barrel would result in a change in our fuel costs of approximately 80 million for the first quarter of 2009 after taking into account existing hedges 

we expected a 69 increase in capacity primarily driven by the addition of independence of the seas  which entered service in may 2008 the addition of celebrity solstice  which entered service in november 2008 and the addition of ocean dream  which entered service in march 2008 

depreciation and amortization expenses were expected to be in the range of 1350 million to 1400 million and interest expense was expected to be in the range of 770 million to 810 million 

based on the expectations contained in this outlook section and assuming that fuel prices remain at the level of the january 29 2009 “atthepump” prices we expected a first quarter 2009 loss per share in the range of 030 to 035 

  

our outlook has remained essentially unchanged since our announcement on january 29 2009 

year ended december 31 2008 compared to year ended december 31 2007 

revenues 

total revenues for 2008 increased 3834 million or 62 to 65 billion from 61 billion in 2007 approximately 3197 million of this increase is attributable to an increase in capacity of 52 the increase in capacity is primarily due to the addition of independence of the seas  which entered service in may 2008 a full year of liberty of the seas which entered service in may 2007 the addition of ocean dream  which entered service in march 2008 and the addition of celebrity solstice  which entered service in november 2008 the remaining increase of 637 million is due primarily to an increase in ticket prices partially offset by a decrease in onboard and other revenues the decrease in onboard and other revenues is due primarily to a decrease in spending on a per passenger basis 

onboard and other revenues included concession revenues of 2308 million in 2008 compared to 2393 million for the same period in 2007 the decrease in concession revenues was primarily due to a decrease in spending on a per passenger basis partially offset by the increase in capacity mentioned above

total cruise operating expenses for 2008 increased 4220 million or 106 to 44 billion from 40 billion for 2007 approximately 2070 million of this increase is attributable to the 52 increase in capacity the remaining increase of 2150 million was primarily driven by increases in fuel expenses and to a lesser extent payroll and related expenses fuel expenses which are net of the financial impact of fuel swap agreements increased 300 per metric ton in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily as a result of increasing fuel prices as a percentage of total revenues fuel expenses were 111 and 89 in 2008 and 2007 respectively the increase in payroll and related expenses was associated with benefits and higher staffing levels 

marketing selling and administrative expenses 

marketing selling and administrative expenses for 2008 decreased 65 million or 08 to 7765 million from 7830 million for 2007 the decrease was primarily due to the cost savings initiative announced during the third quarter to reduce spending along with a change in the employee forfeiture rate assumption related to our stockbased employee compensation plans that resulted in a benefit of approximately 82 million in the second quarter of 2008 as part of the cost savings initiative we eliminated approximately 400 shoreside positions during the third quarter of 2008 the decrease due to the cost savings initiative was partially offset by termination benefits of 90 million related to the same initiative and increases in headcount and other costs associated with personnel during the first six months of 2008 

depreciation and amortization expenses 

depreciation and amortization expenses for 2008 increased 373 million or 77 to 5204 million from 4831 million for the same period in 2007 this increase is primarily due to the addition of independence of the seas which entered service in may 2008 a full year of liberty of the seas  which entered service in may 2007 and the addition of ocean dream  which entered service in march 2008 

other income expense 

interest expense net of interest capitalized decreased to 3273 million in 2008 from 3338 million in 2007 gross interest expense decreased to 3717 million in 2008 from 3737 million in 2007 the decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates partially offset by a higher average debt level interest capitalized increased to 444 million in 2008 from 399 million in 2007 primarily due to a higher average level of investment in ships under construction 

other income increased to 549 million in 2008 from 158 million in 2007 the increase was due to 230 million in foreign currency exchange gains in 2008 as compared to 67 million in foreign currency exchange losses in 2007 for a net change of 297 

  

million when comparing these periods the increase was also due to a 176 million settlement received in the case against pentair water treatment oh company formerly known as essef corporation these increases were partially offset by a gain of 185 million in 2007 related to certain derivatives instruments associated with our ship construction firm commitments denominated in euros that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment which did not recur in 2008 

net yields 

net yields increased 05 in 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 primarily due to increases in ticket prices as mentioned above occupancy in 2008 was 1045 compared to 1057 in 2007 

net cruise costs 

net cruise costs increased 91 in 2008 compared to 2007 due to the 52 increase in capacity mentioned above and a 37 increase in net cruise costs per apcd the increase in net cruise costs per apcd was primarily driven by increases in fuel expenses and to a lesser extent payroll and related expenses related to shipboard employees these increases were partially offset by the decrease in marketing selling and administrative expenses as mentioned above fuel expenses represented 43 percentage points of the overall increase in net cruise costs per apcd 

restructuring initiatives 

on july 21 2008 we announced a cost savings initiative expected to save approximately 1250 million of general and administrative expenses annually this initiative was a response to the reduction in our profitability as part of this initiative we eliminated approximately 400 shoreside positions in addition we discontinued some noncore operations including the scholar ship the elimination of the shoreside positions and the discontinuation of noncore operations were concluded by the end of the third quarter of 2008 

as a result of this initiative we incurred charges all of which were cash charges of 143 million or 007 per share in 2008 comprised of 90 million in termination benefits and 53 million in contract termination costs expenses related to termination benefits were included in marketing selling and administrative expenses and contract termination costs were included in other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations as of december 31 2008 we paid approximately 69 million of the termination benefits and all of the contract termination costs we anticipate paying the remaining termination benefits during 2009 

year ended december 31 2007 compared to year ended december 31 2006 

revenues 

total revenues for 2007 increased 9196 million or 176 to 61 billion from 52 billion in 2006 approximately 6453 million of this increase is attributable to an increase in capacity of 123 the increase in capacity is primarily due to the addition of pullmantur’s fleet the addition of liberty of the seas  which entered service in may 2007 and a full year of freedom of the seas  this increase was partially offset by the revitalization of majesty of the seas during the first quarter of 2007 which was out of service for 28 days and an increase in the number of days ships were in drydock during 2007 as compared to 2006 the remaining increase of 2743 million is due to the addition of pullmantur’s tour business and to a lesser extent an increase in ticket prices this increase was partially offset by a decrease in onboard revenues primarily due to an expanded cruise season in certain markets and itinerary changes for certain ships where passengers spend less onboard our ships 

onboard and other revenues included concession revenues of 2393 million in 2007 compared to 2345 million in 2006 the increase in concession revenues was primarily due to the increase in capacity mentioned above 

  

cruise operating expenses 

total cruise operating expenses for 2007 increased 7321 million or 225 to 40 billion from 32 billion in 2006 approximately 4010 million of this increase is attributable to the 123 increase in capacity the remaining increase of 3311 million was primarily driven by the addition of pullmantur’s tour business which adds costs without corresponding capacity 

marketing selling and administrative expenses 

marketing selling and administrative expenses for 2007 increased 119 to 7830 million from 6999 million for 2007 the increase was primarily due to the addition of pullmantur and other increases in headcount and other costs associated with personnel 

depreciation and amortization expenses 

depreciation and amortization expenses for 2007 increased 615 million or 146 to 4831 million from 4216 million for 2006 this increase is primarily due to the addition of the pullmantur fleet and the addition of liberty of the seas  which entered service in may 2007 the increase was also due to the incremental depreciation as a result of the addition of freedom of the seas  which entered service in june 2006 shoreside additions and ship improvements 

other income expense 

interest expense net of interest capitalized increased to 3338 million in 2007 from 2679 million in 2006 gross interest expense increased to 3737 million in 2007 from 2957 million in 2006 the increase was primarily due to a higher average debt level interest capitalized increased to 399 million in 2007 from 278 million in 2006 primarily due to a higher average level of investment in ships under construction these amounts are recorded in interest expense net of interest capitalized 

other income decreased to 158 million in 2007 from 281 million in 2006 the decrease was primarily due to a 360 million gain on the settlement of a lawsuit in 2006 that did not recur in 2007 partially offset by a gain of 231 million related to certain derivative instruments associated with our ship construction firm commitments denominated in euros that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment

liquidity and capital resources 

sources and uses of cash 

cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity net cash provided by operating activities decreased 1974 million to 11 billion in 2008 compared to 13 billion in 2007 this decrease was primarily a result of a 1185 million decrease in cash received from customer deposits the decrease in customer deposits is a result of a compression in the booking window forward bookings lagging behind the prior year and cruises being purchased for lower ticket prices compared to the prior year the decrease in customer deposits was also attributable to a lesser extent to a decrease in the value of foreign denominated customer deposits due to the strengthening of the united states dollar during 2008 as compared to 2007 

net cash used in investing activities increased to 20 billion in 2008 from 12 billion in 2007 the increase was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures which were 22 billion in 2008 compared to 13 billion in 2007 capital expenditures were primarily related to the delivery of independence of the seas and celebrity solstice in 2008 as compared to liberty of the seas and the purchase of pacific star in 2007 these expenditures were partially offset by settlements of approximately 2698 million and 594 million on our foreign currency forward contracts in 2008 and 2007 respectively along with proceeds from the sale of our investment in island cruises of 514 million in 2008 

net cash provided by financing activities was 11 billion in 2008 compared to 366 million for the same period in 2007 the change was primarily due to a decrease in repayments of debt of approximately 8183 million and an increase in debt proceeds of approximately 2884 million in 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 during 2008 we received 5300 million through an unsecured term loan due through 2015 to purchase independence of the seas and 5191 million through an unsecured term loan due through 2020 to purchase celebrity solstice we also borrowed approximately 12 billion under our unsecured revolving credit facility of which we repaid approximately 5950 million we made debt repayments on various loan facilities and capital leases including a payment of approximately 1500 million to retire our 675 senior notes due march 2008 during 2008 we received 38 million in connection with the exercise of common stock options and paid cash dividends pertaining to the fourth quarter of 2007 and the first second and third quarters of 2008 on our common stock of 1280 million net debttocapital increased to 493 as of december 31 2008 compared to 447 as of december 31 2007 similarly our debttocapital ratio increased to 508 in 2008 from 457 in 2007 

interest capitalized during 2008 increased to 444 million from 399 million for the same period in 2007 due to a higher average level of investment in ships under construction 

future capital commitments 

our future capital commitments consist primarily of new ship orders as of december 31 2008 we had two ships of a new oasisclass designated for royal caribbean international and four solsticeclass ships designated for celebrity cruises  on order for an aggregate additional capacity of approximately 22200 berths the aggregate cost of the six ships is approximately 65 billion of which we have deposited 5401 million as of december 31 2008 approximately 139 of the aggregate cost of ships was exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate at december 31 2008 

as of december 31 2008 we anticipated overall capital expenditures including the six ships on order will be approximately 21 billion for 2009 22 billion for 2010 10 billion for 2011 and 10 billion for 2012 

  

contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2008 our contractual obligations were as follows in thousands 

 

  

     as a normal part of our business depending on market conditions pricing and our overall growth strategy we continuously consider opportunities to enter into contracts for the building of additional ships we may also consider the sale of ships or the purchase of existing ships we continuously consider potential acquisitions and strategic alliances if any of these were to occur they would be financed through the incurrence of additional indebtedness the issuance of additional shares of equity securities or through cash flows from operations 

under the brilliance of the seas operating lease we have agreed to indemnify the lessor to the extent its aftertax return is negatively impacted by unfavorable changes in corporate tax rates capital allowance deductions and certain unfavorable determinations which may be made by united kingdom tax authorities these indemnifications could result in an increase in our lease payments we are unable to estimate the maximum potential increase in our lease payments due to the various circumstances timing or a combination of events that could trigger such indemnifications we have been advised by the lessor that the united kingdom tax authorities are disputing the lessor’s accounting treatment of the lease and that the parties are in discussions on the matter if the characterization of the lease is ultimately determined to be incorrect we could be required to indemnify the lessor under certain circumstances the lessor has advised us that they believe their characterization of the lease is correct based on the foregoing and our review of available information we do not believe an indemnification is probable however if the lessor loses its dispute and we are required to indemnify the lessor we cannot at this time predict the impact that such an occurrence would have on our financial condition and results of operations 

some of the contracts that we enter into include indemnification provisions that obligate us to make payments to the counterparty if certain events occur these contingencies generally relate to changes in taxes increased lender capital costs and other similar costs the indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms and are entered into in the normal course of business there are no stated or notional amounts included in the indemnification clauses and we are not able to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments if any under these indemnification clauses we have not been required to make any payments under such indemnification clauses in the past and under current circumstances we do not believe an indemnification obligation is probable 

other than the items described above we are not party to any other offbalance sheet arrangements including guarantee contracts retained or contingent interest certain derivative instruments and variable interest entities that either have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial position 

  

funding sources 

we have significant contractual obligations of which the capital expenditures associated with our ship purchases and our debt maturities represent our largest funding needs we have 26 billion in contractual obligations due in 2009 of which approximately 20 billion relates to the acquisition of the celebrity equinox and oasis of the seas along with progress payments on other ship purchases in addition we have 108 billion in contractual obligations due beyond 2009 of which debt maturities and ship purchase obligations represent 65 billion and 34 billion respectively we have historically relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations drawdowns under our available credit facilities and the incurrence of additional debt to fund these obligations 

as of december 31 2008 our liquidity was 10 billion consisting of approximately 4029 million in cash and cash equivalents and 6250 million available under our unsecured revolving credit facility in addition we had a working capital deficit of 17 billion as of december 31 2008 as compared to our working capital deficit of 13 billion as of december 31 2007 our december 31 2008 deficit included 9685 million of customer deposits received on sales of cruises collected in advance of sailing and initially recorded as customer deposit liabilities on our balance sheet compared to 11 billion at december 31 2007 substantially all customer deposits represent deferred revenue rather than an actual current cash liability we generate substantial cash flows from operations and our business model has historically allowed us to maintain this working capital deficit and still meet our operating investing and financing needs we expect that we will continue to have working capital deficits in the future 

we have four solsticeclass vessels under construction in germany all of which have committed bank financing arrangements and include financing guarantees from hermes euler hermes kreditrersicherungs ag the export credit agency of the german government for 95 of the financed amount the terms of the financing guarantees and bank commitments are similar to those established for the celebrity solstice and are executable at our option during 2008 we signed a credit agreement for our fifth solsticeclass ship and have elected our option to finance celebrity equinox  we must elect to use the remaining commitments within six months of the relevant ship delivery and they are each subject to customary funding conditions 

we also have two oasisclass vessels under construction in finland oasis of the seas is scheduled for delivery in the fourth quarter of 2009 and allure of the seas is scheduled for delivery in late 2010 we have commitments for financing guarantees from finnvera the export credit agency of finland for 80 of the financed amount we must elect to use these commitments within five months of the ship delivery and they are each subject to customary funding conditions we are working with the relevant export credit agencies and various financial institutions to obtain committed financing for oasis of the seas  this includes exploring opportunities to increase the guarantee level and obtain partial funding support from the relevant export credit agencies although we believe that we will secure committed financing for these ships before their delivery dates there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so or that we will do so on acceptable terms 

the current worldwide economic downturn has adversely impacted our cash flows from operations in addition the turmoil in the credit and capital markets may make it more difficult for us to secure new financing or to raise additional capital or to do so on acceptable terms during 2008 our credit rating was lowered from bbb with a negative outlook to bb with a negative outlook by standard and poor’s in january 2009 standard and poor’s placed our credit rating on credit watch with negative implications in addition our credit rating was lowered from ba1 with a stable outlook to ba2 with a negative outlook by moody’s there is no assurance that our credit ratings will not be lowered further the lowering of our credit ratings may increase our cost of financing and can make it more difficult for us to access the credit and capital markets 

in response to the current environment and in light of our funding needs we have increased our focus on preserving cash and improving our liquidity we have discontinued our dividends curtailed our nonshipbuild capital expenditures currently do not have plans to place further newbuild orders and are working with various financial institutions to secure financing for our oasisclass ships in addition we may elect to fund our contractual obligations through other means if current conditions in the capital markets improve while we anticipate that our cash flows from operations our current available credit facilities our current financing arrangements and those that we expect to obtain will be adequate to meet our capital expenditures and debt repayments over the next twelvemonth period there can be no assurance that this will be the case 

  

if any person other than a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates our two principal shareholders acquires ownership of more than 30 of our common stock and our two principal shareholders in the aggregate own less of our common stock than such person and do not collectively have the right to elect or to designate for election at least a majority of the board of directors we may be obligated to prepay indebtedness outstanding under the majority of our credit facilities which we may be unable to replace on similar terms if this were to occur it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity and operations 

debt covenants 

our financing agreements contain covenants that require us among other things to maintain minimum net worth and fixed coverage ratio and limit our net debttocapital ratio our minimum net worth and maximum net debttocapital calculations exclude the impact of accumulated other comprehensive income loss on total shareholders’ equity the fixed coverage ratio is calculated by dividing net cash from operations by the sum of dividend payments plus scheduled principal debt payments in excess of any new financings we are currently in compliance with all debt covenants the specific covenants and related definitions can be found in the applicable debt agreements the majority of which have been previously filed with the securities and exchange commission as of december 31 2008 our net worth was 71 billion compared with a minimum requirement of 51 billion our fixed coverage ratio was 837x compared with a minimum requirement of 125x and our netdebttocapital ratio was 481 compared to a maximum requirement of 625 

dividends 

during fiscal year 2008 we paid out dividends totaling 1280 million 

in november 2008 our board of directors discontinued our quarterly dividend commencing with the fourth quarter of 2008 this decision is intended to enhance our liquidity during this period of heightened economic and financial market uncertainty

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend financial instruments and other 

general 

we are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices we manage these risks through a combination of our normal operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments pursuant to our hedging practices and policies the financial impacts of these hedging instruments are primarily offset by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures being hedged we achieve this by closely matching the amount term and conditions of the derivative instrument with the underlying risk being hedged we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes we monitor our derivative positions using techniques including market valuations and sensitivity analyses see note 15 fair value measurements to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

the recent turmoil in the credit and capital markets has increased the volatility associated with interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices however we are taking steps to mitigate these risks 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our longterm debt obligations and our operating lease for brilliance of the seas  at december 31 2008 approximately 43 of our longterm debt was effectively fixed and approximately 57 was floating we enter into interest rate swap agreements to modify our exposure to interest rate movements and to manage our interest expense and rent expense 

market risk associated with our longterm fixed rate debt is the potential increase in fair value resulting from a decrease in interest rates at december 31 2008 our interest rate swap agreements effectively changed 3500 million of fixed rate debt with a fixed rate of 725 to liborbased floating rate debt and €10 billion of fixed rate debt with a fixed rate of 5625 to euriborbased floating rate debt we have cross currency swap agreements that effectively change €3000 million of the €10 billion floating euriborbased debt to floating liborbased debt see foreign currency exchange rate risk for further information the estimated fair value of our longterm fixed rate debt at december 31 2008 was 32 billion using quoted market prices where available or using the present value of expected future cash flows the fair value of our associated interest rate swap agreements was estimated to be an asset of 1655 million as of december 31 2008 based on the present value of expected future cash flows a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates at december 31 2008 would increase the fair value of our longterm fixed rate debt by approximately 121 million net of an increase in the fair value of the associated interest rate swap agreements 

market risk associated with our longterm floating rate debt is the potential increase in interest expense from an increase in interest rates a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase our 2009 interest expense by approximately 247 million assuming no change in exchange rates 

market risk associated with our operating lease for brilliance of the seas is the potential increase in rent expense from an increase in sterling libor rates as of january 2008 we have effectively changed 50 of the operating lease obligation from a floating rate to a fixed rate obligation with a weightedaverage rate of 476 through rate fixings with the lessor a hypothetical one percentage point increase in sterling libor rates would increase our 2009 rent expense by approximately 14 million based on the exchange rate at december 31 2008 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to our ship construction firm commitments denominated in euros we enter into eurodenominated forward contracts to manage this risk the estimated fair value of such eurodenominated forward contracts at december 31 2008 was a net unrealized loss of approximately 669 million based on the present value of expected future cash flows at december 31 2008 approximately 139 of the aggregate cost of the ships was exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate a hypothetical 10 strengthening of the euro as of december 31 2008 assuming no changes in comparative interest rates would result in a 5885 million increase in the united states dollar cost of the foreign currency denominated ship construction contracts this increase would be largely offset by an increase in the fair value of our eurodenominated forward contracts 

  

as discussed above we have cross currency swap agreements that effectively change €300 million of floating euriborbased debt to 389 million of floating liborbased debt at december 31 2008 see interest rate risk for further information the estimated fair value of these cross currency swap agreements at december 31 2008 was an asset of approximately 444 million based on the present value of expected future cash flows a hypothetical 10 strengthening of the euro as of december 31 2008 assuming no changes in comparative interest rates would result in an increase in the fair value of the €300 million of floating euriborbased debt by 428 million offset by an increase in the fair value of the cross currency swap agreements of 437 million 

also we consider our investments in foreign subsidiaries to be denominated in relatively stable currencies and of a longterm nature we partially address the exposure of our investments in foreign subsidiaries by denominating a portion of our debt in our subsidiaries’ functional currencies generally euros specifically we have assigned debt of approximately €3930 million or approximately 5491 million as a hedge of our net investment in pullmantur and accordingly have included approximately 232 million of foreigncurrency transaction gains in the foreign currency translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss at december 31 2008 a hypothetical 10 increase or decrease in the december 31 2008 foreign currency exchange rate would increase or decrease the fair value of our assigned debt by 549 million which would be offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the united states dollar value of our net investment 

fuel price risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates to the consumption of fuel on our ships fuel cost net of the financial impact of fuel swap agreements as a percentage of our total revenues was approximately 111 in 2008 89 in 2007 and 92 in 2006 we use a range of instruments including fuel swap agreements to mitigate the financial impact of fluctuations in fuel prices as of december 31 2008 we had fuel swap agreements to pay fixed prices for fuel with an aggregate notional amount of approximately 3672 million maturing through 2010 the estimated fair value of these contracts at december 31 2008 was an unrealized loss of 1913 million we estimate that a hypothetical 10 increase in our weightedaverage fuel price from that experienced during the year ended december 31 2008 would increase our 2009 fuel cost by approximately 767 million this increase would be partially offset by an increase in the fair value of our fuel swap agreements maturing in 2009 of approximately 289 million

industry 

 

cruising continues to represent a small but growing sector of the overall vacation market cruise lines compete with other vacation alternatives such as landbased resort hotels and sightseeing destinations for consumers’ leisure time demand for such activities is influenced by geopolitical and general economic conditions industry data indicates that a significant portion of cruise passengers carried are firsttime cruisers we believe this presents an opportunity for growth and a potential for increased market share through the expansion of our fleet

north america represents the primary source of our cruise passengers and has experienced a compound annual growth rate of approximately 85 since 1970 from 2003 to 2007 north america has experienced a compound annual growth rate in cruise passengers of approximately 60 we estimate that north america was served by 119 ships with approximately 173000 berths at the beginning of 2003 and by 148 ships with approximately 248000 berths by the end of 2007 there are approximately 25 ships with an estimated 71000 berths that are expected to be placed in service in the north american cruise market between 2008 and 2011

segment reporting 

 

we operate four cruise brands royal caribbean international celebrity cruises pullmantur cruises and azamara cruises and launched a new brand cdf croisières de france which will commence operations in may 2008 the brands have been aggregated as a single reportable segment based on the similarity of their economic characteristics as well as products and services provided for financial information see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2007 we employed approximately 4461 fulltime and 607 parttime employees worldwide in our shoreside operations we also employed approximately 41475 shipboard employees as of december 31 2007 approximately 80 of our shipboard employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements we believe that our relationship with our employees is good 

 

insurance 

 

we maintain insurance on the hull and machinery of our ships which includes additional coverage for disbursements earnings and increased value which are maintained in amounts related to the value of each ship the coverage for each of the hull policies is maintained with syndicates of insurance underwriters from the british scandinavian french united states and other international insurance markets 

 

we maintain liability protection and indemnity insurance for each of our ships through either assuranceforeningen gard the united kingdom mutual steam ship assurance association bermuda limited steamship mutual underwriting association bermuda limited or assuranceforeningen skuld 

we maintain war risk insurance for our ships including terrorist risk insurance on each ship through a norwegian war risk insurance organization this coverage includes coverage for physical damage to the ship which is not covered under the hull policies as a result of war exclusion clauses in such hull policies we also maintain protection and indemnity war risk coverage for risks that would be excluded by the rules of the indemnity insurance organizations subject to certain limitations consistent with most marine war risk policies under the terms of our war risk insurance coverage underwriters can give seven days notice to us that the policy will be canceled and reinstated at higher premium rates 

we also maintain a form of business interruption insurance for our ships with our insurance underwriters in the event that a ship is unable to operate during scheduled cruise periods due to loss or damage to the ship arising from certain covered events that last more than a specified period of time we also maintain insurance coverage for certain events which would result in a delayed delivery of our contracted new ships which we normally place starting approximately two years prior to the scheduled delivery dates 

insurance coverage for shoreside property shipboard inventory and general liability risks are maintained with insurance underwriters in the united states and the united kingdom we have decided not to carry business interruption insurance for shoreside operations based on our evaluation of the risks involved and our protective measures already in place as compared to the premium expense 

all insurance coverage is subject to certain limitations exclusions and deductible levels in addition in certain circumstances we coinsure a portion of these risks premiums charged by insurance carriers including carriers in the maritime insurance industry increase or decrease from time to time and tend to be cyclical in nature these cycles are impacted both by our own loss experience and by losses incurred in direct and reinsurance markets we historically have been able to obtain insurance coverage in amounts and at premiums we have deemed to be commercially acceptable no assurance can be given that affordable and secure insurance markets will be available to us in the future particularly for war risk insurance 

the athens convention relating to the carriage of passengers and their luggage by sea 1974 and the 1976 protocol to the athens convention are generally applicable to passenger ships the united states has not ratified the athens convention however with limited exceptions the 1976 athens convention protocol may be contractually enforced with respect to those of our cruises that do not call at a united states port the international maritime organization diplomatic conference agreed upon a new protocol to the athens 

 

 

convention on november 1 2002 the 2002 protocol which is not yet in force substantially increases the level of compulsory insurance which must be maintained by passenger ship operators no assurance can be given as to if or when the 2002 protocol will come into force if in force no assurance can be given that affordable and secure insurance markets will be available to provide the level of coverage required under the 2002 protocol 

 

trademarks 

 

we own a number of registered trademarks related to the royal caribbean international celebrity cruises pullmantur cruises and cdf croisières de france cruise brands and have filed applications to register trademarks related to the azamara cruises brand the registered trademarks include the name “royal caribbean” and its crown and anchor logo the name “celebrity cruises” and its “x” logo the names “pullmantur cruises” and “pullmantur” the name “cdf croisières de france” and the names of various cruise ships we believe trademarks related to the royal caribbean international celebrity cruises and pullmantur cruises brands are widely recognized throughout the world and have considerable value we also believe trademarks related to our new brands azamara cruises and cdf croisières de france will be widely recognized throughout the world and will have considerable value 

 

regulation 

 

our ships are regulated by various international national state and local laws regulations and treaties in force in the jurisdictions in which they operate in addition our ships are registered in the bahamas malta or in the case of celebrity xpedition  ecuador each ship is subject to regulations issued by its country of registry including regulations issued pursuant to international treaties governing the safety of the ship and its passengers each country of registry conducts periodic inspections to verify compliance with these regulations ships operating out of united states ports are subject to inspection by the united states coast guard for compliance with international treaties and by the united states public health service for sanitary conditions our ships are also subject to similar inspections pursuant to the laws and regulations of various other countries our ships visit 

our ships are required to comply with international safety standards defined in the safety of life at sea convention the safety of life at sea convention standards are revised from time to time and the most recent modifications are being phased in through 2010 we do not anticipate that we will be required to make any material expenditures in order to comply with these rules 

 

we are required to obtain certificates from the united states federal maritime commission relating to our ability to satisfy liability in cases of nonperformance of obligations to passengers as well as casualty and personal injury pursuant to the united states federal maritime commission regulations we arrange through our insurers for the provision of guarantees aggregating 450 million for our shipoperating companies as a condition to obtaining the required certificates the united states federal maritime commission has proposed various revisions to the financial responsibility regulations which could require us to significantly increase the amount of our bonds and accordingly increase our costs of compliance 

we are also required by the united kingdom and other jurisdictions to establish our financial responsibility for any liability resulting from the nonperformance of our obligations to passengers from these jurisdictions in the united kingdom we are currently required by the united kingdom passenger shipping association and united kingdom civil aviation authority to provide performance bonds totaling approximately £554 million the united kingdom law has recently been changed effective april 1 2008 such that we will no longer be required by the united kingdom civil aviation authority to provide such performance bonds the impact of this change is that the total value of our performance bonds provided in the united kingdom will be reduced to approximately £344 million as of that date beginning april 1 2008 and thereafter we will be required to pay to the united kingdom civil aviation authority a nonrefundable tax of £1 per passenger this change will not have a material impact on our 2008 results of operations 

we are subject to various united states and international laws and regulations relating to environmental protection under such laws and regulations we are prohibited from among other things discharging certain materials such as petrochemicals and plastics into the waterways we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations from time to time environmental and other regulators consider more stringent regulations which may affect our operations and increase our compliance costs we believe that the impact of cruise ships on the global environment will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world and accordingly this will likely subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 

 

 

our ships are subject to the united states passenger vessel services act “pvsa” which restricts us coastwise trading by foreignflagged cruise ships in november 2007 the us customs and border protection “cbp” proposed an interpretive rule to the pvsa which would require that all roundtrip us cruises by foreign flag vessels spend at least 48 hours in each foreign port of the cruise and that the time spent in foreign ports must be more than 50 of the time spent in all us ports on the cruise we believe that the cbp issued the proposed rule to protect norwegian cruise lines operations in hawaii by making it more difficult for foreignflagged ships to conduct cruises going to hawaii however if the rule is adopted as proposed it could have an impact on other nonhawaii itineraries such as seattlebased alaska and some caribbean cruises which may no longer qualify under the pvsa if this were to occur it could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

we are required to obtain certificates from the united states coast guard relating to our ability to satisfy liability in cases of water pollution pursuant to united states coast guard regulations we arrange through our insurers for the provision of guarantees aggregating 3180 million as a condition to obtaining the required certificates 

we believe that we are in material compliance with all the regulations applicable to our ships and that we have all licenses necessary to conduct our business health safety security and financial responsibility issues are and we believe will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant government authorities in the united states and internationally from time to time various regulatory and legislative changes may be proposed that could impact our operations and would likely subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 

 

taxation of the company 

 

united states federal income tax 

 

the following discussion of the application of the united states federal income tax laws to us and our subsidiaries is based on the current provisions of the united states internal revenue code treasury department regulations administrative rulings and court decisions all of the foregoing is subject to change and any such change could affect the accuracy of this discussion 

 

application of section 883 of the internal revenue code 

 

we and our subsidiary celebrity cruises inc the operator of celebrity cruises and azamara cruises are foreign corporations engaged in a trade or business in the united states and our shipowning subsidiaries are foreign corporations that in many cases depending upon the itineraries of their ships receive income from sources within the united states under section 883 of the internal revenue code certain foreign corporations are not subject to united states income or branch profits tax on united states source income derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships including income from the leasing of such ships 

a foreign corporation will qualify for the benefits of section 883 if in relevant part 1 the foreign country in which the foreign corporation is organized grants an equivalent exemption to corporations organized in the united states and 2a more than 50 of the value of the corporation’s capital stock is owned directly or indirectly by individuals who are residents of a foreign country that grants such an equivalent exemption to corporations organized in the united states or b the stock of the corporation or the direct or indirect corporate parent thereof is “primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market” in the united states or another qualifying country such as norway in the opinion of our united states tax counsel drinker biddle  reath llp based on the representations and assumptions set forth in that opinion we celebrity cruises inc and our shipowning subsidiaries qualify for the benefits of section 883 because we and each of those subsidiaries are incorporated in liberia or malta which are qualifying countries and our common stock is primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market in the united states or norway if in the future liberia no longer qualifies as an equivalent exemption jurisdiction or royal caribbean failed to qualify as a publicly traded corporation it and all of its shipowning or operating subsidiaries that rely on section 883 for tax exemption on qualifying income would be subject to united states federal income tax on their united states source shipping income and income from activities incidental thereto 

 

 

we believe that most of our income and the income of our shipowning subsidiaries is derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships and therefore is exempt from taxation under section 883 in 2005 final regulations became effective under section 883 which among other things narrow somewhat the scope of activities that are considered by the internal revenue service to be incidental to the international operation of ships the activities listed in the regulations as not being incidental to the international operation of ships include income from the sale of air and land transportation shore excursions and pre and post cruise tours to the extent the income from these activities is earned from sources within the united states that income will be subject to united states taxation but the determination of the precise amount of such united states source income involves some uncertainties 

under certain circumstances changes in the identity residence or holdings of our direct or indirect shareholders could cause our common stock not to be “regularly traded on an established securities market” within the meaning of the regulations under section 883 to substantially reduce any such risk in may 2000 our articles of incorporation were amended to prohibit any person other than our two existing largest shareholders from owning directly or constructively as determined for purposes of section 883c3 of the internal revenue code and the regulations promulgated under it more than 49 of the relevant class or classes of our shares under liberian law this amendment may not be enforceable with respect to shares of common stock that were voted against the amendment or that were recorded as abstaining from the vote 

 

also it should be noted that section 883 has been the subject of legislative modifications in past years that have had the effect of limiting its availability to certain taxpayers and there can be no assurance that future legislation will not preclude us from obtaining the benefits of section 883 

 

taxation in the absence of an exemption under section 883 of the internal revenue code 

 

if we celebrity cruises inc or our shipowning subsidiaries were to fail to meet the requirements of section 883 of the internal revenue code or if the provision was repealed then as explained below such companies would be subject to united states income taxation on a portion of their income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships 

because we and celebrity cruises inc conduct a trade or business in the united states we and celebrity cruises inc would be taxable at regular corporate rates on our separate company taxable income ie without regard to the income of our shipowning subsidiaries from united states sources which includes 100 of income if any from transportation that begins and ends in the united states not including possessions of the united states 50 of income from transportation that either begins or ends in the united states and no income from transportation that neither begins nor ends in the united states the legislative history of the transportation income source rules suggests that a cruise that begins and ends in a united states port but that calls on more than one foreign port will derive united states source income only from the first and last legs of such cruise this conclusion is not free from doubt however because there are no regulations or other internal revenue service interpretations of the above rules in addition if any of our earnings and profits effectively connected with our united states trade or business were withdrawn or were deemed to have been withdrawn from our united states trade or business those withdrawn amounts would be subject to a “branch profits” tax at the rate of 30 the amount of such earnings and profits would be equal to the aforesaid united states source income with certain generally minor adjustments less income taxes we and celebrity cruises inc would also be potentially subject to tax on portions of certain interest paid by us at rates of up to 30 

if section 883 were not available to our shipowning subsidiaries each such subsidiary would be subject to a special 4 tax on its united states source gross transportation income if any each year because it does not have a fixed place of business in the united states and its income is derived from the leasing of a ship such united states source gross transportation income may be determined under any reasonable method including ratios of days traveling directly to or from united states ports to total days traveling or of the lessee’s united states source gross income from the ship as determined under the source rules discussed in the preceding paragraph and subject to the assumptions and qualifications set forth therein to the lessee’s total gross income from the ship 

maltese income tax 

 

our pullmantur ship owneroperator subsidiaries qualify as licensed shipping organizations in malta no maltese income tax is charged on the income derived from shipping activities of a licensed shipping organization instead a licensed shipping organization is liable to pay a tonnage tax based on the net tonnage of 

 

 

the ship or ships registered under the relevant provisions of the merchant shipping act a company qualifies as a shipping organization if it engages in qualifying activities and it obtains a license from the registrargeneral to enable it to carry on such activities qualifying activities include but are not limited to the ownership operation under charter or otherwise administration and management of a ship or ships registered as a maltese ship in terms of the merchant shipping act and the carrying on of all ancillary financial security and commercial activities in connection therewith 

 

our maltese operations that do not qualify as licensed shipping organizations which are not considered significant remain subject to normal maltese corporate income tax 

 

united kingdom income tax 

 

the brilliance of the seas is operated by a company that is strategically and commercially managed in the united kingdom which has elected to be subject to the united kingdom tonnage tax regime “uk tonnage tax” companies subject to uk tonnage tax pay a corporate tax on a notional profit determined with reference to the net tonnage of qualifying vessels normal united kingdom corporate income tax is not chargeable on the relevant shipping profits of a qualifying uk tonnage tax company the requirements for a company to qualify for the uk tonnage tax regime include being subject to united kingdom corporate income tax operating qualifying ships which are strategically and commercially managed in the united kingdom and fulfilling a seafarer training requirement 

 

relevant shipping profits include income from the operation of qualifying ships and from shipping related activities our united kingdom income from nonshipping activities which do not qualify under the uk tonnage tax regime and which are not considered significant remain subject to united kingdom corporate income tax however her majesty’s revenue  customs hmrc have announced its intention to make changes to the tonnage tax legislation in the finance act of 2008 that include among other things amendments to the types of activities that qualify for the tonnage tax regime we do not expect the impact of these changes to be material to our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2008 

 

state taxation 

 

we celebrity cruises inc and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various us state income taxes which are generally imposed on each state’s portion of the united states source income subject to federal income taxes additionally the state of alaska passed ballot initiative 2 which became effective in 2007 and which among other things subjects commercial passenger vessel income to alaska corporate state income taxes and also imposes a 33 tax on income from onboard gambling activities this did not have a material impact to our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2007 

 

other taxation 

 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to income tax in the united states or other jurisdictions on income that does not qualify for exemption under section 883 or tonnage tax regimes the tax on such income was not material to our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2007

 item 1a risk factors 

 

the risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k are important factors among others that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historical results it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently this list should not be considered a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a note regarding forwardlooking statements 

 

we may lose business to competitors throughout the vacation market  

 

we operate in the vacation market and cruising is one of many alternatives for people choosing a vacation we therefore risk losing business not only to other cruise lines but also to other vacation operators which provide other leisure options including hotels resorts and package holidays and tours 

 

we face significant competition from other cruise lines both on the basis of cruise pricing and also in terms of the nature of ships and services we offer to passengers our principal competitors within the cruise vacation industry include carnival corporation  plc which owns among others carnival cruise lines princess cruises costa cruises holland america line po cruises cunard line and aida cruises star cruises ncl corporation ltd which owns among others norwegian cruise line mediterranean shipping company which owns msc cruises disney cruise line and oceania cruises 

 

 

in the event that we do not compete effectively with other vacation alternatives and cruise companies our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

 

overcapacity within the cruise vacation industry a reduction in demand or geopolitical and economic uncertainties could have a negative impact on revenues result in impairment of assets and may adversely affect our results of operations  

 

cruising capacity has grown in recent years and we expect it to increase further as the major cruise vacation companies introduce new ships demand for cruises has been and is expected to continue to be dependent on the strength of the economies in the countries in which we market our products the public’s attitude towards the safety of travel and the geopolitical climate economic or political changes may reduce demand for cruise vacations and may lead to reduced occupancy andor price discounting for instance the current weakening of the us economy and the tighter credit markets could have an adverse effect on vacationers’ discretionary income and consumer confidence which could result in a lower demand for cruises lower cruise prices and lower onboard revenues all of which would adversely affect our revenues in turn these results could have a negative impact on revenues result in impairment of assets and may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 

fears of terrorist attacks war and other hostilities and the spread of contagious diseases could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

 

events such as terrorist attacks war and other hostilities and the resulting political instability travel restrictions the spread of contagious diseases and concerns over safety health and security aspects of traveling have had and could have in the future a significant adverse impact on demand and pricing in the travel and vacation industry these events could also impact our ability to source qualified crew from throughout the world at competitive costs and therefore increase our shipboard employee costs 

 

incidents or adverse publicity concerning the cruise vacation industry or unusual weather conditions could affect our reputation and harm our future sales and results of operations  

the operation of cruise ships involves the risk of accidents illnesses and other incidents which may bring into question passenger safety health security and vacation satisfaction and thereby adversely affect future industry performance incidents involving cruise ships adverse media publicity concerning the cruise vacation industry or unusual weather patterns or natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes could impact demand and consequently have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

environmental health and safety financial responsibility and other maritime regulations could affect operations and increase operating costs  

 

the united states and various state and foreign government or regulatory agencies have enacted or are considering new environmental regulations or policies that could adversely impact the cruise vacation industry some environmental groups have lobbied for more stringent regulation of cruise ships and have generated negative publicity about the cruise vacation industry and its environmental impact in addition we are subject to various international national state and local laws regulations and treaties that govern among other things safety standards applicable to our ships health and sanitary standards applicable to our passengers security standards on board our ships and at the shipport interface areas and financial responsibilities to our passengers these issues are and we believe will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world this could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise ships that would subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 

in november 2007 the us customs and border protection “cbp” proposed an interpretive rule to the united states passenger vessel services act “pvsa” which would require that all roundtrip us cruises by foreign flag vessels spend at least 48 hours in each foreign port of the cruise and that the time spent in foreign ports must be more than 50 of the time spent in all us ports on the cruise we believe that the cbp issued the proposed rule to protect norwegian cruise lines operations in hawaii by making it more difficult for foreignflagged ships to conduct cruises going to hawaii however if the rule is adopted as proposed it could 

 

be construed to apply to other nonhawaii itineraries such as seattlebased alaska and some caribbean cruises which may no longer qualify under the pvsa if this was to occur it could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be able to obtain financing on terms that are favorable or consistent with our expectations  

 

to fund our capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments we rely on a combination of cash flows provided by operations drawdowns under our available credit facilities the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the sales of equity or debt securities in private or public securities markets our credit ratings impact our ability to obtain financing in financial markets and the terms of the financing any lowering of our credit ratings may have adverse consequences on our ability to access the financial markets andor on our cost of financings in addition interest rates and our ability to obtain financing are dependent on many economic and political factors beyond our control accordingly we cannot be sure that our cash flows from operations and additional financings will be available in accordance with our expectations 

 

conducting business internationally may result in increased costs and other risks  

 

we operate our business internationally and plan to continue to develop our international presence operating internationally exposes us to a number of risks examples include political risks and risk of increases in duties and taxes as well as changes in laws and policies affecting cruising vacation or maritime businesses or governing the operations of foreignbased companies additional risks include currency fluctuations interest rate movements imposition of trade barriers and restrictions on repatriation of earnings if we are unable to address these risks adequately our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we have ship construction contracts which are denominated in euros while we have entered into eurodenominated forward contracts to manage a portion of the currency risk associated with these ship construction contracts we are exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate for the portion of the ship construction contracts that has not been hedged if the shipyard is unable to perform under the related ship construction contract any foreign currency hedges that were entered into to manage the currency risk would need to be terminated termination of these contracts could result in a significant loss 

 

ship construction delays or mechanical faults may result in cancellation of cruises or unscheduled drydocks and repairs and thus adversely affect our results of operations  

 

we depend on shipyards to construct and deliver our cruise ships on a timely basis and in good working order the sophisticated nature of building a ship involves risks delays or mechanical faults in ship construction have in the past and may in the future result in delays or cancellation of cruises or necessitate unscheduled drydocks and repairs of ships we have for example experienced mechanical problems with the pod propulsion units on certain ships and there can be no assurance that we will not experience such problems in the future delays or cancellations of cruise ships may also adversely impact our ability to maintain our contractual minimum commitments to our ports these events and any related adverse publicity could result in lost revenue increased operating expenses or both and thus adversely affect our results of operations 

 

shipyard financial difficulties or insolvencies shortages in available shipbuilding facilities and component parts due to strong demand for shipbuilding services within the industry and industry consolidations may cause delivery delays or price increases that could adversely affect our results of operations 

 

conditions in the shipyard industry over which we have no control can affect our financial results for example we regularly introduce new ships to our fleet and regularly repair and refurbish our existing fleet the timely delivery of new ships and our ability to repair and refurbish our fleet can be adversely affected by factors such as shipyard financial difficulties shortages in shipbuilding component parts and capacity constraints at qualified shipyard repair facilities delivery delays and cancelled deliveries can adversely affect our results of operations as can any constraints on our ability to repair and maintain our ships on a timely basis in addition the cruise shipyard industry is undergoing consolidation which could result in stronger bargaining power on the part of the shipyards and thus higher prices for our ships 

 

 

aker yards oy the shipyard that is building independence of the seas and our two project genesis class ships announced a lowering of its projected profits and delays in the construction of its vessels we have engaged in discussions with aker yards oy to assess the impact of this situation on the ships they are building for us based on such discussions we do not expect that this situation will have a material impact on our results of operations however in the event that the financial situation of aker yards oy deteriorates further it could have a material impact on the delivery and costs associated with our project genesis class ships and our future results of operations 

our operating costs and taxes could increase due to market forces and economic or political factors beyond our control 

 

our operating costs including fuel food payroll insurance and security costs are subject to increases due to market forces and economic or political instability or other factors beyond our control increases in these operating costs could adversely affect our profitability in addition united states state and local authorities as well as foreign authorities periodically consider increases in taxes the implementation of these and other taxes could also cause an increase in our costs 

the office of the attorney general for the state of florida is conducting a review of our temporary fuel supplement that we implemented in the fourth quarter of 2007 on our royal caribbean international celebrity cruises and azamara cruises brands we are cooperating with the attorney general’s office in connection with this review and investigation at this time we are unable to determine the impact of this item on our 2008 consolidated financial statements 

unavailability of ports of call may adversely affect our results of operations  

 

we believe that port destinations are a major reason why passengers choose to go on a particular cruise or on a cruise vacation the availability of ports is affected by a number of factors including but not limited to existing capacity constraints security concerns adverse weather conditions and natural disasters financial limitations on port development exclusivity arrangements that ports may have with our competitors local governmental regulations and local community concerns about port development and other adverse impacts on their communities from additional tourists any limitations on the availability of our ports of call or on the availability of shore excursion and other service providers at such ports could adversely affect our results of operations 

 

price increases for commercial airline service for our passengers or major changes or reduction in commercial airline service could undermine our ability to provide reasonably priced vacation packages to our guests 

 

many of our guests depend on scheduled commercial airline services to transport them to or from the ports where our cruises embark or disembark increases in the price of airfare would increase the overall price of the cruise vacation to our guests which may adversely impact demand for our cruises in addition changes in the availability of commercial airline services could adversely affect our ability to fly our passengers to or from our cruise ships which could adversely affect our results of operations 

 

a change in our tax status under the united states internal revenue code or other jurisdictions may have adverse effects on our income  

 

we and a number of our subsidiaries are foreign corporations that derive income from a united states trade or business andor from sources within the united states drinker biddle  reath llp our united states tax counsel has delivered to us an opinion based on certain representations and assumptions set forth in it to the effect that this income to the extent derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships is exempt from united states income tax pursuant to section 883 of the internal revenue code we believe that most of our income including that of our subsidiaries is derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships 

in 2005 final regulations under section 883 became effective which narrowed somewhat the scope of activities that are considered by the internal revenue service to be incidental to the international operation of ships to the extent the income from nonincidental activities is earned from sources within the united states that income will be subject to united states taxation but the determination of the precise amount of such united states source income involves some uncertainties 

 

 

  it should also be noted that the provisions of section 883 are subject to change at any time by legislation moreover changes could occur in the future with respect to the identity residence or holdings of our direct or indirect shareholders that could affect our eligibility for the section 883 exemption accordingly there can be no assurance that we will continue to be exempt from united states income tax on united states source shipping income in the future if we were not entitled to the benefit of section 883 we and our subsidiaries would be subject to united states taxation on a portion of the income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships which would reduce our net income see taxation of the company above for a discussion of such taxation in the absence of an exemption under section 883 

 

finally changes in the income tax laws affecting our operations in malta the united kingdom or elsewhere could result in higher income taxes being charged against our operations resulting in lower net income 

 

we are controlled by principal shareholders that have the power to determine our policies management and actions requiring shareholder approval  

as of february 12 2008 a wilhelmsen as a norwegian corporation indirectly owned by members of the wilhelmsen family of norway owned approximately 201 of our common stock and cruise associates a bahamian general partnership indirectly owned by various trusts primarily for the benefit of certain members of the pritzker family and a trust primarily for the benefit of certain members of the ofer family owned approximately 156 of our common stock a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates have the power to determine among other things 

 

• our policies and the policies of our subsidiaries 

 

• the persons who will be our directors and officers and 

 

• actions requiring shareholder approval 

 

a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates are parties to a shareholders’ agreement the agreement provides that our board of directors will consist of the following persons 

 

• four nominees of a wilhelmsen as 

 

• four nominees of cruise associates and 

 

• our chief executive officer 

 

during the term of the shareholders’ agreement certain corporate actions require the approval of at least one director nominated by a wilhelmsen as and one director nominated by cruise associates our principal shareholders are not prohibited from engaging in a business that may compete with our business subject to certain exceptions if any person other than a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates our two principal shareholders acquires ownership of more than 30 of our common stock and our two principal shareholders in the aggregate own less of our common stock than such person and do not collectively have the right to elect or to designate for election at least a majority of the board of directors we may be obligated to prepay indebtedness outstanding under the majority of our credit facilities which we may be unable to replace on similar terms if this were to occur it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity and operations 

the holders of our common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their equity interest as a result of the sale of currently restricted shares of our common stock into the public market  

 

a substantial number of shares of our common stock were either issued by us in private transactions not involving a public offering or are held by our affiliates and therefore the sale of these securities is subject to restrictions under the securities act of 1933 “securities act” these shares include the 201 shares of our common stock held by a wilhelmsen as and the 156 held by cruise associates no predictions can be made as to the effect if any that market sales of such shares or the availability of such shares for future market sales will have on the market price of our common stock prevailing from time to time sales of substantial amounts of our common stock or the perceptions that such sales could occur could materially adversely affect the prevailing market price for our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through an offering of equity securities each of a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates has the right pursuant to a registration rights agreement to require us subject to certain qualifications to effect the registration under the securities act of all or part of their shares of common stock which would allow these shares to be sold into the public market 

 

 

we are not a united states corporation and our shareholders may be subject to the uncertainties of a foreign legal system in protecting their interests  

 

our corporate affairs are governed by our restated articles of incorporation and bylaws and by the business corporation act of liberia the provisions of the business corporation act of liberia resemble provisions of the corporation laws of a number of states in the united states however while most states have a fairly well developed body of case law interpreting their respective corporate statutes there are very few judicial cases in liberia interpreting the business corporation act of liberia for example the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under liberian law are not as clearly established as the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in certain united states jurisdictions thus our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests with respect to actions by management directors or controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a united states jurisdiction 

 

litigation enforcement actions fines or penalties could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations andor damage our reputation 

our business is subject to various united states and international laws and regulations that could lead to enforcement actions fines civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims and damages in addition improper conduct by our employees or agents could damage our reputation andor lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties including substantial monetary fines in certain circumstances it may not be economical to defend against such matters andor a legal strategy my not ultimately result in us prevailing in a matter such events could lead to an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations

in january 2006 a purported class action lawsuit was filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york alleging that we infringed rights in copyrighted works and other intellectual property by presenting performances on our cruise ships without securing the necessary licenses the suit seeks payment of damages disgorgement of profits and a permanent injunction against future infringement in april 2006 we filed a motion to sever and transfer the case to the united states district court for the southern district of florida the motion is pending we are not able at this time to estimate the impact of this proceeding 

 

we have a lawsuit pending in the circuit court for miamidade county florida against rolls royce coproducer of the mermaid podpropulsion system on millenniumclass ships for the recurring mermaid pod failures alstom power conversion the other coproducer of the podpropulsion system settled out of this suit in january 2006 for 380 million the 380 million settlement resulted in a gain of 360 million net of reimbursements to insurance companies which we recorded within other income in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31 2006 we are not able at this time to estimate the outcome of the rolls royce proceeding 

celebrity cruises has been awarded damages in connection with its pending case in new york federal court against essef corp for claims stemming from a 1994 outbreak of legionnaires’ disease on one of celebrity cruises’ ships the award reflects the culmination of two jury trials held in june 2006 and june 2007 respectively as most recently modified by the trial judge in january 2008 judgment has not yet been entered and when entered the judgment is subject to appeal the award would result in a net payment to celebrity cruises after costs and payment to insurers of approximately 150 million we are not able at this time to estimate the outcome of this proceeding and as of december 31 2007 no amount of this award has been recognized in our consolidated financial statements 

in july 2006 a purported class action lawsuit was filed in the united states district court for the central district of california alleging that we failed to timely pay crew wages and failed to pay proper crew overtime the suit seeks payment of damages including penalty wages under the us seaman’s wage act and equitable relief damages under the california unfair competition law in december 2006 the district court granted our motion to dismiss the claim and held that it should be arbitrated pursuant to the arbitration provision in royal caribbean’s collective bargaining agreement in january 2007 the plaintiffs appealed the order to the united states ninth circuit court of appeals we are not able at this time to estimate the impact of this proceeding on us 

 

the miami district office of the us equal employment opportunity commission “eeoc” has alleged that certain of our shipboard employment practices do not comply with us employment laws in june 2007 the eeoc proposed payment of monetary sanctions and certain remedial actions we are reviewing the matter with the eeoc and no legal proceedings have been initiated we do not believe that this matter will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

 

the office of the attorney general for the state of florida is conducting a review of our fuel supplement that we implemented in the fourth quarter of 2007 on our royal caribbean international celebrity cruises and azamara cruise brands in addition we have been informed that the same office is conducting an investigation to determine whether there is or has been a violation of state or federal antitrust laws in connection with the setting by us and other cruise line operators of our respective fuel supplements we are cooperating with the attorney general’s office in connection with this review and investigation we are not able at this time to estimate the impact of this review and investigation on us 

in february 2008 a purported class action lawsuit was filed in the united states district court for the southern district of florida the lawsuit alleges among other things that we other cruise lines and a trade association violated federal antitrust laws or state deceptive and unfair trade practices laws by conspiring to fix the prices of the fuel supplements announced by the various cruise lines or misleading consumers as to the relationship between each cruise line’s fuel costs and the fuel supplements it is charging its customers we are not able at this time to estimate the impact of this proceeding on us 

we are routinely involved in other claims typical within the cruise vacation industry the majority of these claims are covered by insurance we believe the outcome of such claims net of expected insurance recoveries will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations

critical accounting policies 

 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america see note 1 general and note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  certain of our accounting policies are deemed “critical” as they require management’s highest degree of judgment estimates and assumptions we have discussed these accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors we believe our most critical accounting policies are as follows 

 

ship accounting 

 

our ships represent our most significant assets and are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation depreciation of ships is generally computed net of a 15 projected residual value using the straightline method over estimated service lives of primarily 30 years improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized as additions to the ship and depreciated over the improvements’ estimated useful lives the estimated cost and accumulated depreciation of replaced or refurbished ship components are written off and any resulting losses are recognized in cruise operating expenses repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred we use the deferral method to account for drydocking costs under the deferral method drydocking costs incurred are deferred and charged to expense on a straightline basis over the period to the next scheduled drydock deferred drydock costs consist of the costs to drydock the vessel and other costs incurred in connection with the drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessel’s class certification see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

our service life and residual value estimates take into consideration the impact of anticipated technological changes longterm cruise and vacation market conditions and historical useful lives of similarlybuilt ships in addition we take into consideration our estimates of the average useful lives of the ships’ major component systems such as hull superstructure main electric engines and cabins given the very large and complex nature of our ships our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain we do not have cost segregation studies performed to specifically componentize our ship systems therefore we estimate the costs of component systems based principally on general and technical information known about major ship component systems and their lives and our knowledge of the cruise vacation industry we do not identify and track depreciation by ship component systems but instead utilize these estimates to determine the net cost basis of assets replaced or refurbished 

we believe we have made reasonable estimates for ship accounting purposes however should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimates of ship service lives or projected residual values depreciation expense could be materially higher or lower if circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making determinations as to whether ship improvements should be capitalized the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance costs could increase partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense if we had reduced our estimated average 30year ship service life by one year depreciation expense for 2007 would have increased by approximately 250 million if our ships were estimated to have no residual value depreciation expense for 2007 would have increased by approximately 985 million 

valuation of longlived assets goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

 

we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash flows if these estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference between the asset’s estimated fair value and its carrying value 

 

the determination of fair value is based on quoted market prices in active markets if available such markets are often not available for used cruise ships accordingly we also base fair value on independent appraisals sales price negotiations and projected future cash flows discounted at a rate determined by management to be commensurate with the business risk the estimation of fair value utilizing discounted forecasted cash flows includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of revenues operating costs marketing selling and administrative expenses interest rates ship additions and retirements cruise vacation industry competition and general economic and business conditions among other factors 

 

 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are reviewed annually or when events or circumstances dictate more frequently the impairment review for goodwill consists of a two step process of first determining the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it to the carrying value of the net assets allocated to the reporting unit if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value no further analysis or writedown of goodwill is required if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the net assets the implied fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all the underlying assets and liabilities including both recognized and unrecognized tangible and intangible assets based on their fair value if necessary goodwill is then written down to its implied fair value the indefinitelife intangible asset impairment review consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinitelife intangible asset with its carrying amount if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess if the fair value exceeds its carrying amount the indefinitelife intangible asset is not considered impaired 

the fair value of a reporting unit and an indefinitelife intangible asset is based on quoted market prices if available quoted market prices are often not available for individual reporting units and for indefinitelife intangible assets accordingly we base the fair value of a reporting unit and an indefinitelife intangible asset on an expected present value technique which is often the best technique available to estimate fair value the expected present value technique for a reporting unit and an indefinitelife intangible asset consists of estimating expected future cash flows discounted using a rate commensurate with the business risk the estimation of fair value utilizing discounted expected future cash flows includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of expected revenues operating costs marketing selling and administrative expenses interest rates ship additions and retirements as well as assumptions regarding the cruise vacation industry competition and general economic and business conditions among other factors 

 

we believe we have made reasonable estimates and judgments in determining whether our longlived assets and intangible assets have been impaired however if there is a material change in the assumptions used in our determination of fair values or if there is a material change in the conditions or circumstances influencing fair value we could be required to recognize a material impairment charge 

 

contingencies — litigation 

 

on an ongoing basis we assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss if any can be made in assessing probable losses we take into consideration estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries if any we accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recoveries it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made 

 

terminology 

our revenues are seasonal based on demand for cruises demand is strongest for cruises during the north american summer months and holidays our revenues consist of the following items 

passenger ticket revenues consist of revenue recognized from the sale of passenger tickets and the sale of air transportation to and from our ships 

onboard and other revenues consist primarily of revenues from the sale of goods andor services onboard our ships not included in passenger ticket prices cancellation fees sales of vacation protection insurance pre and postcruise tours pullmantur cruises’ landbased tours and hotel and air packages also included are revenues we receive from independent third party concessionaires that pay us a percentage of their revenues in exchange for the right to provide selected goods andor services onboard our ships 

 

our cruise operating expenses consist of the following 

 

commissions transportation and other expenses consist of those costs directly associated with passenger ticket revenues including travel agent commissions air and other transportation expenses port costs that vary with passenger head counts and related credit card fees 

onboard and other expenses consist of the direct costs associated with onboard and other revenues these costs include the cost of products sold onboard our ships vacation protection insurance premiums costs associated with pre and postcruise tours and related credit card fees these costs also include minimal costs associated with concession revenues as the costs are mostly incurred by third party concessionaires 

payroll and related expenses consist of costs for shipboard personnel 

food expenses include food costs for both passengers and crew 

fuel expenses include fuel and related delivery and storage costs including the financial impact of fuel swap agreements 

other operating expenses consist primarily of operating costs such as repairs and maintenance port costs that do not vary with passenger head counts vessel operating lease costs costs associated with pullmantur cruises’ landbased tours vessel related insurance and entertainment 

we do not allocate payroll and related costs food costs fuel costs or other operating costs to the expense categories attributable to passenger ticket revenues or onboard and other revenues since they are incurred to provide the total cruise vacation experience 

nongaap financial measures 

 

available passenger cruise days “apcd” are our measurement of capacity and represent double occupancy per cabin multiplied by the number of cruise days for the period 

gross cruise costs represent the sum of total cruise operating expenses plus marketing selling and administrative expenses 

gross yields represent total revenues per apcd 

net cruise costs represent gross cruise costs excluding commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses each of which is described below under the overview heading in measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income we believe changes in net cruise costs to be the most relevant indicator of our performance a reconciliation of historical gross cruise costs to net cruise costs is provided below under summary of historical results of operations  we have not provided a quantitative reconciliation of projected gross cruise costs to projected net cruise costs due to the significant uncertainty in projecting the costs deducted to arrive at this measure accordingly we do not believe that reconciling information for such projected figures would be meaningful 

net debttocapital is a ratio which represents total longterm debt including current portion of longterm debt less cash and cash equivalents “net debt” divided by the sum of net debt and total shareholders equity we believe net debt and net debttocapital along with total longterm debt and shareholders equity are useful measures of our capital structure a reconciliation of historical debttocapital to net debttocapital is provided below under summary of historical results of operations 

net revenues represent total revenues less commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses each of which is described under the overview heading 

net yields represent net revenues per apcd we utilize net revenues and net yields to manage our business on a daytoday basis as we believe that it is the most relevant measure of our pricing performance because it reflects the cruise revenues earned by us net of our most significant variable costs which are commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses a reconciliation of historical 

 

 

gross yields to net yields is provided below under summary of historical results of operations  we have not provided a quantitative reconciliation of projected gross yields to projected net yields due to the significant uncertainty in projecting the costs deducted to arrive at this measure accordingly we do not believe that reconciling information for such projected figures would be meaningful 

occupancy in accordance with cruise vacation industry practice is calculated by dividing passenger cruise days by apcd a percentage in excess of 100 indicates that three or more passengers occupied some cabins 

passenger cruise days represent the number of passengers carried for the period multiplied by the number of days of their respective cruises 

executive overview 

 

over the past five years we have experienced higher passenger ticket prices and onboard revenues while maintaining strong occupancies as a result net yields have grown from 14663 in 2003 to 18364 in 2007 the industry’s focus has shifted so that a larger portion of the revenue growth has come from markets outside of north america we have responded to this shift by redeploying some of our ships to certain international markets such as europe latin america and asia as well as focusing on the continued development of our international passenger sourcing as a result our passenger ticket revenues generated by sales originating outside of north america has increased from approximately 19 in 2003 to 30 in 2007 due to the recent recovery in north american bookings and continued strengthening internationally we expect to see further yield improvements in 2008 in spite of the current weakening of the us economy and the tighter credit markets these current economic conditions however could eventually have an adverse effect on vacationers’ discretionary income and consumer confidence which could result in a lower demand for cruises lower cruise prices and lower onboard revenues in the future 

 

from 2003 through 2007 the cruise industry has been adversely impacted directly and indirectly by substantial increases in fuel prices in 2003 fuel cost per metric ton was 204 whereas in 2007 our fuel cost per metric ton was 455 an increase of 123 if our fuel cost per metric ton in 2007 had remained at 2003s level our fuel expenses would have been approximately 300 million lower in 2007 in addition fuel and other factors have caused cost increases elsewhere including transportation food products and other commodities we have been able to partially mitigate this increase in these costs with our hedging program and energy saving initiatives also we implemented a temporary fuel supplement in 2008 however we believe this fuel supplement will be partially offset by reductions in ticket prices we believe higher and volatile fuel prices are a factor that will continue to impact our results of operations for the foreseeable future despite these pressures we continue to focus on cost savings initiatives and expect to limit increases in our net cruise costs on an apcd basis excluding fuel to 1 to 2 in 2008 

the company expects to continue the expansion of its international passenger sourcing and the development and growth of its innovative fleet of ships as of december 31 2007 we had signed agreements with two shipyards providing for the construction of seven additional cruise ships these new ships are expected to continue to help us maintain our current position within the worldwide cruise industry the yearoveryear percentage increase in our capacity for fiscal 2008 2009 2010 and 2011 is currently planned to be 51 93 114 and 64 respectively 

 

summary of historical results of operations 

 

total revenues increased 176 to 61 billion from total revenues of 52 billion in 2006 primarily due to a 123 increase in capacity and a 47 increase in gross yields net yields increased by approximately 33 compared to the same period in 2006 the increase in net yields was primarily due to the addition of pullmantur’s tour business which provides additional revenues without corresponding capacity and to a lesser extent a positive pricing environment the increase in total revenues was offset by an increase in expenses primarily due to the increase in capacity and the acquisition of pullmantur as well as an increase in interest expense as a result our net income was 6034 million or 282 per share on a fully diluted basis in 2007 compared to 6339 million or 294 per share on a fully diluted basis in 2006

outlook 

 

  on january 30 2008 we announced the following guidance for the full year and first quarter of 2008 

full year 2008 

 

  we announced that bookings have been better than expected given the current economic conditions we expected net yields to increase approximately 4 compared to 2007 

we expected net cruise costs per apcd to increase approximately 2 compared to 2007 excluding fuel we expected net cruise costs per apcd to increase in the range of 1 to 2 compared to 2007 

 

we do not forecast fuel prices and our cost outlook for fuel is based on current “atthepump” prices including any hedge impacts if fuel prices for the full year 2008 remain at the level of january 30 2008 fuel expenses for the full year 2008 would be approximately 5950 million or 484 per metric ton for the full year 2008 our fuel expense is 45 hedged and a 10 change in the market price of fuel would result in a change in fuel costs of approximately 350 million for the full year 2008 after taking into account existing hedges 

we expected a 51 increase in capacity in 2008 primarily driven by the addition of independence of the seas  which will enter service in may 2008 a full year of liberty of the sea s the addition of pacific star  which will enter service during the first quarter of 2008 and the addition of celebrity solstice which will enter service in december 2008 

depreciation and amortization expenses were expected to be in the range of 5250 million to 5450 million and interest expense was expected to be in the range of 3400 million to 3600 million 

based on the expectations contained in this outlook section and assuming that fuel prices remain at the level of the january 30 2008 “atthepump” prices we expected full year 2008 earnings per share to be in the range of 320 to 340 

first quarter 2008 

 

  as announced on january 30 2008 we expected net yields will increase approximately 7 compared to 2007 

we expected net cruise costs per apcd to increase approximately 1 compared to 2007 excluding fuel we expected net cruise costs per apcd to decrease in the range of 1 to 2 compared to 2007 

we do not forecast fuel prices and our cost outlook for fuel is based on current “atthepump” prices including any hedge impacts if fuel prices for the first quarter of 2008 remain at the level of january 30 2008 fuel expenses for the first quarter of 2008 would be approximately 1450 million or 492 per metric ton for the first quarter of 2008 our fuel expense is 52 hedged and a 10 change in the market price of fuel would result in a change in fuel costs of approximately 80 million for the first quarter of 2008 after taking into account existing hedges 

we expected an 88 increase in capacity primarily driven by the addition of liberty of the seas  which entered service in may 2007 

depreciation and amortization expenses were expected to be in the range of 1230 million to 1280 million and interest expense was expected to be in the range of 820 million to 870 million 

based on the expectations contained in this outlook section and assuming that fuel prices remain at the level of the january 30 2008 “atthepump” prices we expected first quarter 2008 earnings per share to be in the range of 030 to 035 

 

 

update to outlook 

 

since our january 30 2008 announcement we have evaluated major changes in our operating environment including booking trends fuel prices the impact of our fuel supplement and other factors based on our evaluation of these factors our outlook for the year remains substantially unchanged and we continue to expect full year 2008 earnings per share to be in the range of 320 to 340 mainly due to a shift in the timing of certain expenses we now believe first quarter earnings per share will be in the range of 025 to 030 

 

year ended december 31 2007 compared to year ended december 31 2006 

 

revenues 

 

net revenues increased 161 in 2007 compared to 2006 due to a 123 increase in capacity and a 33 increase in net yields the increase in capacity was primarily attributed to the addition of pullmantur cruises’ fleet the addition of liberty of the seas  which entered service in may 2007 and a full year of freedom of the seas  this increase was partially offset by the revitalization of majesty of the seas during the first quarter of 2007 which was out of service for 28 days and an increase in the number of days ships were in drydock during 2007 as compared to 2006 the increase in net yields was primarily due to the addition of pullmantur’s tour business which provides additional revenues without corresponding capacity and to a lesser extent an increase in ticket prices on a per passenger basis this increase was partially offset by a decrease in onboard revenues primarily due to an expanded cruise season in certain markets and itinerary changes for certain ships where guests spend less onboard our ships occupancy in 2007 was 1057 compared to 1065 in 2006 gross yields increased 47 in 2007 compared to 2006 which was a larger percentage increase than net yields primarily due to increases in commissions transportation other expenses and onboard and other expenses the increase in commissions transportation and other expenses was primarily due to pullmantur cruise’s higher commission expenses this increase was also due to increases in these direct costs as a result of an expanded cruise season in certain markets and itinerary changes for certain ships the increase in onboard and other expenses was primarily due to increases in shore excursions and landtour packages sold to our guests as a result of an expanded cruise season in certain markets and itinerary changes for certain ships as well as the acquisition of pullmantur 

onboard and other revenues included concession revenues of 2393 million and 2345 million in 2007 and 2006 respectively the increase in concession revenues was primarily due to the increase in capacity mentioned above 

expenses 

 

net cruise costs increased 198 in 2007 compared to 2006 due to a 123 increase in capacity mentioned above and a 66 increase in net cruise costs per apcd the increase in net cruise costs per apcd was primarily due to increases in other operating expenses other operating expenses increased primarily due to the addition of pullmantur’s tour business which adds costs without corresponding capacity gross cruise costs increased 206 in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to the same reasons discussed above for net cruise costs 

depreciation and amortization expenses increased 146 in 2007 compared to 2006 the increase was primarily due to the addition of the pullmantur fleet and the addition of liberty of the seas  which entered service in may 2007 the increase was also due to the incremental depreciation as a result of the addition of freedom of the seas  which entered service in june 2006  shore side additions and ship improvements 

 

other income expense 

 

interest expense net of interest capitalized increased to 3338 million in 2007 from 2679 million in 2006 gross interest expense increased to 3737 million in 2007 from 2957 million in 2006 the increase was primarily due to a higher average debt level interest capitalized increased to 399 million in 2007 from 278 million in 2006 primarily due to a higher average level of investment in ships under construction these amounts are recorded in interest expense net of interest capitalized 

 

 

other income decreased to 158 million in 2007 from 281 million in 2006 the decrease was primarily due to a 360 million gain on the settlement of a lawsuit in 2006 that did not recur in 2007 partially offset by a gain of 231 million related to certain derivative instruments associated with our ship construction firm commitments denominated in euros that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment 

year ended december 31 2006 compared to year ended december 31 2005 

 

revenues 

 

net revenues increased 65 in 2006 compared to 2005 due to a 34 increase in net yields and a 30 increase in capacity the increase in net yields was primarily due to higher cruise ticket prices onboard spending and revenue associated with the charter of horizon to island cruises our joint venture with tui travel higher cruise ticket prices were primarily attributable to a strong demand environment the increase in capacity was primarily attributed to the addition of freedom of the seas in 2006 and the lengthening of enchantment of the seas in 2005 this increase was partially offset by the charter of horizon to island cruises occupancy in 2006 was 1065 compared to 1066 in 2005 gross yields increased 35 in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to the same reasons discussed above for net yields 

onboard and other revenues included concession revenues of 2345 million and 2230 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively the increase in concession revenues was primarily due to the increase in capacity mentioned above and higher amounts spent per passenger onboard 

expenses 

 

net cruise costs increased 97 in 2006 compared to 2005 due to a 64 increase in net cruise costs per apcd and the 30 increase in capacity mentioned above approximately 40 percentage points of the increase in net cruise costs per apcd were attributed to increases in fuel expenses total fuel expenses net of the financial impact of fuel swap agreements increased 282 per metric ton in 2006 as compared to an increase of 460 per metric ton in 2005 as a percentage of total revenues fuel expenses were 92 and 75 in 2006 and 2005 respectively the remaining 24 percentage points of the increase in net cruise costs per apcd were primarily attributed to increases in marketing selling and administrative expenses associated with personnel costs gross cruise costs increased 88 in 2006 compared to 2005 which was a lower percentage increase than net cruise costs primarily due to lower trip insurance expenses a result of lower trip insurance premiums and lower commission expenses as a result of an increase in direct business 

depreciation and amortization expenses increased 49 in 2006 compared to 2005 the increase was primarily due to the addition of freedom of the seas ship improvements and shore side additions 

 

other income expense 

 

gross interest expense increased to 2957 million in 2006 from 2874 million in 2005 the increase was primarily attributable to higher interest rates partially offset by lower average debt levels interest capitalized increased to 278 million in 2006 from 177 million in 2005 primarily due to a higher average level of investment in ships under construction 

during 2006 we partially settled a pending lawsuit against rolls royce and alstom power conversion coproducers of the mermaid podpropulsion system on millenniumclass ships for the recurring mermaid pod failures under the terms of the partial settlement we received 380 million from alstom and released them from the suit which remains pending against rolls royce the 380 million settlement resulted in a gain of 360 million net of reimbursements to insurance companies 

in july 2005 tui travel redeemed in full its 675 convertible preferred shares we received 3481 million in cash resulting in a net gain of 442 million primarily due to foreign exchange 

dividend income decreased approximately 142 million for 2006 compared to 2005 due to the redemption of our tui travel investment in the third quarter of 2005 

 

 

cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 

in the third quarter of 2005 we changed our method of accounting for drydocking costs from the accrual in advance to the deferral method see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  the change resulted in a onetime gain of 525 million or 022 per share on a diluted basis to recognize the cumulative effect of the change on prior years which we reflected as part of our results in 2005 other than this onetime gain the change did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

sources and uses of cash 

 

cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity net cash provided by operating activities was 13 billion in 2007 and 9485 million in 2006 the increase was primarily a result of an increase in customer deposits of 1847 million and an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of 1502 million the increase in customer deposits was primarily due to incremental deposits received for our recently acquired and soon to be delivered ships  this increase was also due to higher ticket prices and the timing of scheduled drydocks as compared to 2006 the increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities was due to the timing of payments of interest and other shortterm liabilities the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was also due to 1212 million in payments of accreted interest on the lyons repurchase in 2006 that did not recur in 2007 

net cash used in investing activities decreased to 12 billion in 2007 from 18 billion in 2006 the decrease was primarily due to 5533 million related to the purchase of pullmantur net of cash acquired during 2006 that did not recur in 2007 the decrease was also due to the purchase of 1000 million of notes from tui travel during 2006 which were repaid in 2007 the decrease was partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures which were 13 billion in 2007 compared to 12 billion in 2006 capital expenditures were primarily related to the purchase of pacific star  the deliveries of liberty of the seas in 2007 and freedom of the seas in 2006 as well as progress payments for ships under construction in both years 

net cash provided by financing activities was 366 million in 2007 compared to 8797 million in 2006 the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from debt issuances of 9989 million and an increase in repayments of debt of 200 million the decrease was also partially offset by 1646 million of treasury stock purchased during 2006 that did not recur in 2007 during 2007 we received net proceeds of €9909 million or 13 billion from a bond offering consisting of €10 billion or 13 billion of 5625 senior unsecured notes due 2014 in addition we received 5890 million through an unsecured term loan due through 2014 to purchase liberty of the seas and drew 500 million on our unsecured revolving credit facility during 2007 we made debt repayments on various loan facilities and capital leases including a payment of 9065 million to retire the €7010 million outstanding balance on our unsecured bridge loan facility in addition we made 4650 million in payments towards our unsecured revolving credit facility a payment of 2000 million to retire our 7 unsecured senior notes due 2007 and a payment of 612 million to repay term loans secured by two celebrity ships during 2007 and 2006 we received 196 million and 230 million respectively in connection with the exercise of common stock options and we paid cash dividends on our common stock of 983 million and 1245 million respectively net debttocapital decreased to 447 in 2007 compared to 466 in 2006 similarly our debttocapital ratio decreased to 457 in 2007 from 471 in 2006 

interest capitalized during 2007 increased to 399 million from 278 million in 2006 primarily due to a higher average level of investment in ships under construction 

 

future capital commitments 

 

our future capital commitments consist primarily of new ship orders as of december 31 2007 we had one freedomclass ship and two ships of a new project genesis class designated for royal caribbean international and four solsticeclass ships designated for celebrity cruises  on order for an aggregate additional capacity of approximately 25800 berths the aggregate cost of the seven ships is approximately 70 billion of which we have deposited 4996 million as of december 31 2007 approximately 77 of the aggregate cost of ships was exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate at december 31 2007 see note 13 fair value of financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

 

 

as of december 31 2007 we anticipated overall capital expenditures including the seven ships on order will be approximately 19 billion for 2008 20 billion for 2009 22 billion for 2010 and 10 billion for 2011 

recently we reached an agreement with meyer werft to build a fifth solsticeclass ship for celebrity cruises subject to certain conditions for an additional capacity of approximately 2850 berths expected to enter service in the fourth quarter of 2012 based on current exchange rates we estimate the allin cost of this ship will be approximately 320000 per berth this amount is not included in the anticipated overall capital expenditures reflected above 

contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

as of december 31 2007 our contractual obligations were as follows in thousands 

  

as a normal part of our business depending on market conditions pricing and our overall growth strategy we continuously consider opportunities to enter into contracts for the building of additional ships we may also consider the sale of ships we continuously consider potential acquisitions and strategic alliances if any of these were to occur they would be financed through the incurrence of additional indebtedness the issuance of additional shares of equity securities or through cash flows from operations 

under the brilliance of the seas operating lease we have agreed to indemnify the lessor to the extent its aftertax return is negatively impacted by unfavorable changes in corporate tax rates capital allowance deductions and certain unfavorable determinations which may be made by united kingdom tax authorities these indemnifications could result in an increase in our lease payments we are unable to estimate the maximum potential increase in our lease payments due to the various circumstances timing or a combination of events that could trigger such indemnifications under current circumstances we do not believe an indemnification in any material amount is probable 

 

some of the contracts that we enter into include indemnification provisions that obligate us to make payments to the counterparty if certain events occur these contingencies generally relate to changes in taxes increased lender capital costs and other similar costs the indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms and are entered into in the normal course of business there are no stated or notional amounts included in the indemnification clauses and we are not able to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments if any under these indemnification clauses we have not been required to make any payments under such indemnification clauses in the past and under current circumstances we do not believe an indemnification in any material amount is probable 

 

other than the items described above we are not party to any other offbalance sheet arrangements including guarantee contracts retained or contingent interest certain derivative instruments and variable interest entities that either have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial position 

 

funding sources 

 

as of december 31 2007 our liquidity was 14 billion consisting of approximately 02 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 12 billion available under our unsecured revolving credit facility see note 6 longterm debt to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  we have contractual obligations of approximately 20 billion due during the twelvemonth period ending december 31 2008 we anticipate these contractual obligations could be funded through a combination of cash 

 

 

flows from operations drawdowns under our available unsecured revolving credit facility the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the sales of equity or debt securities in private or public securities markets although we believe our existing unsecured revolving credit facility cash flows from operations our ability to obtain new borrowings andor raise new capital or a combination of these sources will be sufficient to fund operations debt payment requirements capital expenditures and other commitments over the next twelvemonth period there can be no assurances that these sources of cash will be available in accordance with our expectations 

 

our financing agreements contain covenants that require us among other things to maintain minimum net worth fixed charge coverage ratio and limit our net debttocapital ratio we were in compliance with all covenants as of december 31 2007 

 

if any person other than a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates our two principal shareholders acquires ownership of more than 30 of our common stock and our two principal shareholders in the aggregate own less of our common stock than such person and do not collectively have the right to elect or to designate for election at least a majority of the board of directors we may be obligated to prepay indebtedness outstanding under the majority of our credit facilities which we may be unable to replace on similar terms if this were to occur it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity and operations 

 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

financial instruments and other 

 

general 

 

we are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices we manage these risks through a combination of our normal operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments pursuant to our hedging practices and policies the financial impacts of these hedging instruments are primarily offset by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures being hedged we achieve this by closely matching the amount term and conditions of the derivative instrument with the underlying risk being hedged we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes we monitor our derivative positions using techniques including market valuations and sensitivity analyses see note 13 fair value of financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

 

interest rate risk 

 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our longterm debt obligations and our operating lease for brilliance of the seas  at december 31 2007 58 of our longterm debt was effectively fixed and 42 was floating we enter into interest rate swap agreements to modify our exposure to interest rate movements and to manage our interest expense and rent expense 

 

market risk associated with our longterm fixed rate debt is the potential increase in fair value resulting from a decrease in interest rates at december 31 2007 our interest rate swap agreements effectively changed 3500 million of fixed rate debt with a weightedaverage fixed rate of 725 to liborbased floating rate debt and €10 billion of fixed rate debt with a weightedaverage fixed rate of 5625 to euriborbased floating rate debt we have cross currency swap agreements that effectively change €3000 million of the €10 billion floating euriborbased debt to floating liborbased debt see foreign currency exchange rate risk for further information the estimated fair value of our longterm fixed rate debt at december 31 2007 was 50 billion using quoted market prices where available or using the present value of expected future cash flows the fair value of our associated interest rate swap agreements was estimated to be an asset of 234 million as of december 31 2007 based on the present value of expected future cash flows a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates at december 31 2007 would increase the fair value of our longterm fixed rate debt by approximately 995 million net of an increase in the fair value of the associated interest rate swap agreements 

market risk associated with our longterm floating rate debt is the potential increase in interest expense from an increase in interest rates a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase our 2008 interest expense by approximately 193 million assuming no change in exchange rates 

 

market risk associated with our operating lease for brilliance of the seas is the potential increase in rent expense from an increase in sterling libor rates as of january 2008 we have effectively changed 50 of the operating lease obligation from a floating rate to a fixed rate obligation with a weightedaverage rate of 476 through rate fixings with the lessor a hypothetical one percentage point increase in sterling libor rates would increase our 2008 rent expense by approximately 22 million based on the exchange rate at december 31 2007 

 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

 

our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to our ship construction firm commitments denominated in euros we enter into eurodenominated forward contracts to manage this risk the estimated fair value of such eurodenominated forward contracts at december 31 2007 was a net unrealized gain of approximately 4137 million based on the present value of expected future cash flows at december 31 2007 approximately 77 of the aggregate cost of the ships was exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate a hypothetical 10 strengthening of the euro as of december 31 2007 assuming no changes in comparative interest rates would result in a 6203 million increase in the united states dollar cost of the foreign currency denominated ship construction contracts this increase would be largely offset by an increase in the fair value of our eurodenominated forward contracts 

 

 

as discussed above we have cross currency swap agreements that effectively change €3000 million of floating euriborbased debt to 3891 million of floating liborbased debt at december 31 2007 see interest rate risk for further information the estimated fair value of these cross currency swap agreements at december 31 2007 was an asset of approximately 540 million based on the present value of expected future cash flows a hypothetical 10 strengthening of the euro as of december 31 2007 assuming no changes in comparative interest rates would result in an increase in the fair value of the €3000 million of floating euriborbased debt by 438 million offset by an increase in the fair value of the cross currency swap agreements of 447 million 

also we consider our investments in foreign subsidiaries to be denominated in relatively stable currencies and of a longterm nature we partially address the exposure of our investments in foreign subsidiaries by denominating a portion of our debt in our subsidiaries’ functional currencies generally euros specifically we have assigned debt of approximately €4660 million or approximately 6799 million as a hedge of our net investment in pullmantur and accordingly have included approximately 640 million of foreigncurrency transaction losses in the foreign currency translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss at december 31 2007 a hypothetical 10 increase or decrease in the december 31 2007 foreign currency exchange rate would increase or decrease the fair value of our assigned debt by 680 million which would be offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the us dollar value of our net investment 

 

fuel price risk 

 

our exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates to the consumption of fuel on our ships fuel cost net of the financial impact of fuel swap agreements as a percentage of our total revenues was approximately 89 in 2007 92 in 2006 and 75 in 2005 we use fuel swap agreements to mitigate the financial impact of fluctuations in fuel prices as of december 31 2007 we had fuel swap agreements to pay fixed prices for fuel with an aggregate notional amount of approximately 2239 million maturing through 2009 the estimated fair value of these contracts at december 31 2007 was an unrealized gain of 686 million we estimate that a hypothetical 10 increase in our weightedaverage fuel price from that experienced during the year ended december 31 2007 would increase our 2008 fuel cost by approximately 574 million this increase would be partially offset by an increase in the fair value of our fuel swap agreements maturing in 2008 of approximately 208 million

industry 

since 1970 cruising has been one of the fastest growing sectors of the vacation market as the number of north american passengers has grown to an estimated 108 million in 2006 from 05 million in 1970 a compound annual growth rate of approximately 9 however from 2002 to 2006 a significant amount of growth was experienced resulting in a compound annual growth rate of approximately 12 we have sought to capitalize on the increasing popularity of cruises through an extensive fleet expansion program 

  

according to our estimates the north american cruise market was served by an estimated 112 cruise ships with approximately 156987 berths at the beginning of 2002 we estimate that this capacity increased to approximately 229486 berths on approximately 140 ships by the end of 2006 the increase in capacity over the last five years is net of approximately 24 ships with approximately 33584 berths that have either been retired or moved out of the north american market there are approximately 24 cruise ships with an estimated 68360 berths that are expected be placed in service between 2007 and 2010 

  

the following table details the growth in the north american cruise market of both passengers and estimated weightedaverage berths over the past five years 

  

  

    

cruise lines compete for consumers’ disposable leisure time spending with other vacation alternatives such as landbased resort hotels and sightseeing destinations demand for such activities is influenced by geopolitical and general economic conditions we believe that cruise passengers currently represent only a small share of the vacation market and that a significant portion of cruise passengers carried are firsttime cruisers 

  

our ships operate worldwide and have itineraries that call on destinations in alaska asia australia the bahamas bermuda california canada the caribbean europe the galapagos islands hawaii mexico new england new zealand the panama canal and south america 

  

we compete with a number of cruise lines however our principal competitors are carnival corporation  plc which owns among others carnival cruise lines princess cruises holland america line costa cruises po cruises and cunard line star cruises which owns among others star cruises and norwegian cruise line mediterranean shipping company which owns msc cruises and disney cruise line

our ships are regulated by various international national state and local laws regulations and treaties in force in the jurisdictions in which they operate in addition our ships are registered in the bahamas malta or in the case of celebrity xpedition  ecuador each ship is subject to regulations issued by its country of registry including regulations issued pursuant to international treaties governing the safety of the ship and its passengers each country of registry conducts periodic inspections to verify compliance with these regulations ships operating out of united states ports are subject to inspection by the united states coast guard for compliance with international treaties and by the united states public health service for sanitary conditions our ships are also subject to similar inspections pursuant to the laws and regulations of various other countries our ships visit 

  

our ships are required to comply with international safety standards defined in the safety of life at sea convention the safety of life at sea convention standards are revised from time to time and the most recent modifications are being phased in through 2010 we do not anticipate that we will be required to make any material expenditures in order to comply with these rules 

  

we are required to obtain certificates from the united states federal maritime commission relating to our ability to satisfy liability in cases of nonperformance of obligations to passengers as well as casualty and personal injury pursuant to the united states federal maritime commission regulations we arrange through our insurers for the provision of guarantees aggregating 450 million for our shipoperating companies as a condition to obtaining the required certificates the united states federal maritime commission has proposed various revisions to the financial responsibility regulations which could require us to significantly increase the amount of our bonds and accordingly increase our costs of compliance 

  

we are also required by the united kingdom and other jurisdictions to establish our financial responsibility for any liability resulting from the nonperformance of our obligations to passengers from these jurisdictions in the united kingdom we are currently required by the united kingdom passenger shipping association and united kingdom civil aviation authority to provide performance bonds totaling approximately £443 million 

  

we are subject to various united states and international laws and regulations relating to environmental protection under such laws and regulations we are prohibited from among other things discharging certain materials such as petrochemicals and plastics into the waterways we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations from time to time environmental and other regulators consider more stringent regulations which may affect our operations and increase our compliance costs we believe that the impact of cruise ships on the global environment will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world and accordingly this will likely subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 

  

we are required to obtain certificates from the united states coast guard relating to our ability to satisfy liability in cases of water pollution pursuant to united states coast guard regulations we arrange through our insurers for the provision of guarantees aggregating 3180 million as a condition to obtaining the required certificates 

  

we believe that we are in material compliance with all the regulations applicable to our ships and that we have all licenses necessary to conduct our business health safety security and financial responsibility issues are and we believe will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant government authorities in the united states and internationally from time to time various regulatory and legislative changes may be proposed that could impact our operations and would likely subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 

  

  

  

  

  

taxation of the company 

  

united states federal income tax 

  

the following discussion of the application of the united states federal income tax laws to us and our subsidiaries is based on the current provisions of the united states internal revenue code treasury department regulations administrative rulings and court decisions all of the foregoing is subject to change and any such change could affect the accuracy of this discussion 

  

application of section 883 of the internal revenue code 

  

we and our subsidiary celebrity cruises inc the operator of celebrity cruises are foreign corporations engaged in a trade or business in the united states and our shipowning subsidiaries are foreign corporations that in many cases depending upon the itineraries of their ships receive income from sources within the united states under section 883 of the internal revenue code certain foreign corporations are not subject to united states income or branch profits tax on united states source income derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships including income from the leasing of such ships 

  

a foreign corporation will qualify for the benefits of section 883 if in relevant part 1 the foreign country in which the foreign corporation is organized grants an equivalent exemption to corporations organized in the united states and 2a more than 50 of the value of the corporation’s capital stock is owned directly or indirectly by individuals who are residents of a foreign country that grants such an equivalent exemption to corporations organized in the united states or b the stock of the corporation or the direct or indirect corporate parent thereof is “primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market” in the united states or another qualifying country such as norway in the opinion of our united states tax counsel drinker biddle  reath llp based on the representations and assumptions set forth in that opinion we celebrity cruises inc and our shipowning subsidiaries qualify for the benefits of section 883 because we and each of those subsidiaries are incorporated in liberia or malta which are qualifying countries and our common stock is primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market in the united states or norway 

  

we believe that most of our income and the income of our shipowning subsidiaries is derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships and therefore is exempt from taxation under section 883 in 2005 final regulations became effective under section 883 which among other things narrow somewhat the scope of activities that are considered by the internal revenue service to be incidental to the international operation of ships the activities listed in the regulations as not being incidental to the international operation of ships include income from the sale of air and land transportation shore excursions and pre and post cruise tours to the extent the income from these activities is earned from sources within the united states that income will be subject to united states taxation but the determination of the precise amount of such united states source income involves some uncertainties the tax impact of these new regulations reduced our net income for the year ended december 31 2006 by approximately 63 million and we anticipate tax impacts in subsequent years on an ongoing basis 

  

under certain circumstances changes in the identity residence or holdings of our direct or indirect shareholders could cause our common stock not to be “regularly traded on an established securities market” within the meaning of the regulations under section 883 to substantially reduce any such risk in may 2000 our articles of incorporation were amended to prohibit any person other than our two existing largest shareholders from owning directly or constructively as determined for purposes of section 883c3 of the internal revenue code and the regulations promulgated under it more than 49 of the relevant class or classes of our shares under liberian law this amendment may not be enforceable with respect to shares of common stock that were voted against the amendment or that were recorded as abstaining from the vote 

  

also it should be noted that section 883 has been the subject of legislative modifications in past years that have had the effect of limiting its availability to certain taxpayers and there can be no assurance that future legislation will not preclude us from obtaining the benefits of section 883 at this time however there is no known limiting legislation pending before the united states congress 

  

  

  

  

taxation in the absence of an exemption under section 883 of the internal revenue code 

  

if we celebrity cruises inc or our shipowning subsidiaries were to fail to meet the requirements of section 883 of the internal revenue code or if the provision was repealed then as explained below such companies would be subject to united states income taxation on a portion of their income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships 

  

because we and celebrity cruises inc conduct a trade or business in the united states we and celebrity cruises inc would be taxable at regular corporate rates on our separate company taxable income ie without regard to the income of our shipowning subsidiaries from united states sources which includes 100 of income if any from transportation that begins and ends in the united states not including possessions of the united states 50 of income from transportation that either begins or ends in the united states and no income from transportation that neither begins nor ends in the united states the legislative history of the transportation income source rules suggests that a cruise that begins and ends in a united states port but that calls on more than one foreign port will derive united states source income only from the first and last legs of such cruise this conclusion is not free from doubt however because there are no regulations or other internal revenue service interpretations of the above rules in addition if any of our earnings and profits effectively connected with our united states trade or business were withdrawn or were deemed to have been withdrawn from our united states trade or business those withdrawn amounts would be subject to a “branch profits” tax at the rate of 30 the amount of such earnings and profits would be equal to the aforesaid united states source income with certain generally minor adjustments less income taxes we and celebrity cruises inc would also be potentially subject to tax on portions of certain interest paid by us at rates of up to 30 

  

if section 883 were not available to our shipowning subsidiaries each such subsidiary would be subject to a special 4 tax on its united states source gross transportation income if any each year because it does not have a fixed place of business in the united states and its income is derived from the leasing of a ship such united states source gross transportation income may be determined under any reasonable method including ratios of days traveling directly to or from united states ports to total days traveling or of the lessee’s united states source gross income from the ship as determined under the source rules discussed in the preceding paragraph and subject to the assumptions and qualifications set forth therein to the lessee’s total gross income from the ship 

  

maltese income tax 

  

the pullmantur shipowning subsidiaries qualify as licensed shipping organizations in malta no maltese income tax is charged on the income derived from shipping activities of a licensed shipping organization instead a licensed shipping organization is liable to pay a tonnage tax based on the net tonnage of the ship or ships registered under the relevant provisions of the merchant shipping act a company qualifies as a shipping organization if it engages in qualifying activities and it obtains a license from the registrargeneral to enable it to carry on such activities qualifying activities include but are not limited to the ownership operation under charter or otherwise administration and management of a ship or ships registered as a maltese ship in terms of the merchant shipping act and the carrying on of all ancillary financial security and commercial activities in connection therewith 

  

our maltese operations that do not qualify as licensed shipping organizations which are not considered significant remain subject to normal maltese corporate income tax 

  

united kingdom income tax 

  

the brilliance of the seas is operated by a company that is strategically and commercially managed in the united kingdom which has elected to be subject to the united kingdom tonnage tax regime “uk tonnage tax” companies subject to uk tonnage tax pay a corporate tax on a notional profit determined with reference to the net tonnage of qualifying vessels normal united kingdom corporate income tax is not chargeable on the relevant shipping profits of a qualifying uk tonnage tax company the requirements for a company to qualify for the uk tonnage tax regime include being subject to united kingdom corporate income tax operating qualifying ships which are strategically and commercially managed in the united kingdom and fulfilling a seafarer training requirement 

  

  

  

relevant shipping profits include income from the operation of qualifying ships and from shipping related activities our united kingdom income from nonshipping activities which do not qualify under the uk tonnage tax regime and which are not considered significant remain subject to united kingdom corporate income tax

 item 1a risk factors 

  

the risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k are important factors among others that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historical results it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently this list should not be considered a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a note regarding forwardlooking statements 

  

we may lose business to competitors throughout the vacation market  

  

we operate in the vacation market and cruising is one of many alternatives for people choosing a vacation we therefore risk losing business not only to other cruise lines but also to other vacation operators which provide other leisure options including hotels resorts and package holidays and tours 

  

we face significant competition from other cruise lines both on the basis of cruise pricing and also in terms of the nature of ships and services we offer to cruise passengers our principal competitors within the cruise vacation industry include carnival corporation  plc which owns among others carnival cruise lines princess cruises holland america line costa cruises po cruises and cunard line star cruises which owns among others star cruises and norwegian cruise line mediterranean shipping company which owns msc cruises and disney cruise line 

  

in the event that we do not compete effectively with other vacation alternatives and cruise companies our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

  

overcapacity within the cruise vacation industry a reduction in demand or geopolitical and economic uncertainties could have a negative impact on revenues result in impairment of assets and may adversely affect profitability  

  

cruising capacity has grown in recent years and we expect it to increase further as the major cruise vacation companies introduce new ships demand for cruises has been and is expected to continue to be dependent on the strength of the economies in the countries in which we market our products the public’s attitude towards the safety of travel and the geopolitical climate economic or political changes may reduce demand for cruise vacations and may lead to reduced occupancy andor price discounting which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and could result in impairment of our asset values 

  

fears of terrorist attacks war and other hostilities and the spread of contagious diseases could have a negative impact on our profitability 

  

events such as terrorist attacks war and other hostilities the spread of contagious diseases and the resulting political instability travel restrictions and concerns over safety health and security aspects of traveling have had and could have in the future a significant adverse impact on demand and pricing in the travel and vacation industry these events could also impact our ability to source qualified crew from throughout the world at competitive costs and therefore increase our shipboard employee costs 

  

incidents or adverse publicity concerning the cruise vacation industry or unusual weather conditions could affect our reputation and harm our future sales and profitability  

  

the operation of cruise ships involves the risk of accidents illnesses and other incidents which may bring into question passenger safety health security and vacation satisfaction and thereby adversely affect future industry performance incidents involving cruise ships adverse media publicity concerning the cruise vacation industry or unusual weather patterns or natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes could impact demand and consequently have an adverse impact on our profitability 

  

  

  

environmental health and safety financial responsibility and other maritime regulations could affect operations and increase operating costs  

  

the united states and various state and foreign government or regulatory agencies have enacted or are considering new environmental regulations or policies that could adversely impact the cruise vacation industry some environmental groups have lobbied for more stringent regulation of cruise ships and have generated negative publicity about the cruise vacation industry and its environmental impact in addition we are subject to various international national state and local laws regulations and treaties that govern among other things safety standards applicable to our ships health and sanitary standards applicable to our passengers security standards on board our ships and at the shipport interface areas and financial responsibilities to our passengers these issues are and we believe will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world this could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise ships that would subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 

  

we may not be able to obtain financing on terms that are favorable or consistent with our expectations  

  

to fund our capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments we rely on a combination of cash flows provided by operations drawdowns under our available credit facility the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the sales of equity or debt securities in private or public securities markets our credit ratings impact our ability to obtain financing in financial markets and the terms of the financing any lowering of our credit ratings may have adverse consequences on our ability to access the financial markets andor on our cost of financings in addition interest rates and our ability to obtain financing are dependent on many economic and political factors beyond our control accordingly we cannot be sure that our cash flows from operations and additional financings will be available in accordance with our expectations 

  

conducting business internationally may result in increased costs and other risks  

  

we operate our business internationally and plan to continue to develop our international presence operating internationally exposes us to a number of risks examples include political risks and risk of increases in duties and taxes as well as changes in laws and policies affecting cruising vacation or maritime businesses or governing the operations of foreignbased companies additional risks include currency fluctuations interest rate movements imposition of trade barriers and restrictions on repatriation of earnings if we are unable to address these risks adequately our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

  

we have ship construction contracts which are denominated in euros while we have entered into eurodenominated forward contracts to manage a portion of the currency risk associated with these ship construction contracts we are exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate for the portion of the ship construction contracts that has not been hedged if the shipyard is unable to perform under the related ship construction contract any foreign currency hedges that were entered into to manage the currency risk would need to be terminated termination of these contracts could result in a significant loss 

  

ship construction delays or mechanical faults may result in cancellation of cruises and unscheduled drydocks and repairs  

  

we depend on shipyards to construct and deliver our cruise ships on a timely basis and in good working order the sophisticated nature of building a ship involves risks delays or mechanical faults in ship construction have in the past and may in the future result in delays or cancellation of cruises or necessitate unscheduled drydocks and repairs of ships shipyard insolvency and other industrial actions could also delay or indefinitely postpone the timely delivery of new ships we have experienced mechanical problems with the pod propulsion units on certain ships and there can be no assurance that we will not experience such problems in the future these events together with any related adverse publicity could to the extent they are not covered by contractual provisions or insurances adversely affect our financial results 

  

our operating costs and taxes could increase due to market forces and economic or political factors beyond our control 

  

our operating costs including fuel food payroll insurance and security costs are subject to increases due to market forces and economic or political instability or other factors beyond our control increases in these operating costs could adversely affect our profitability in addition united states state and local authorities as well as foreign authorities periodically consider increases in taxes the implementation of these and other taxes could also cause an increase in our costs 

  

  

  

unavailability of ports of call may adversely affect our profits  

  

we believe that port destinations are a major reason why passengers choose to go on a particular cruise or on a cruise vacation the availability of ports is affected by a number of factors including but not limited to existing capacity constraints security concerns adverse weather conditions and natural disasters financial limitations on port development local governmental regulations and local community concerns about port development and other adverse impacts on their communities from additional tourists any limitations on the availability of our ports of call could adversely affect our profits 

  

a change in our tax status under the united states internal revenue code may have adverse effects on our income  

  

we and a number of our subsidiaries are foreign corporations that derive income from a united states trade or business andor from sources within the united states drinker biddle  reath llp our united states tax counsel has delivered to us an opinion based on certain representations and assumptions set forth in it to the effect that this income to the extent derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships is exempt from united states income tax pursuant to section 883 of the internal revenue code we believe that most of our income including that of our subsidiaries is derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships 

  

in 2005 final regulations under section 883 became effective which narrowed somewhat the scope of activities that are considered by the internal revenue service to be incidental to the international operation of ships to the extent the income from nonincidental activities is earned from sources within the united states that income will be subject to united states taxation but the determination of the precise amount of such untied states source income involves some uncertainties the tax impact of these new regulations reduced our net income for the year ended december 31 2006 by approximately 63 million and we anticipate tax impacts in subsequent years on an ongoing basis 

  

it should also be noted that the provisions of section 883 are subject to change at any time by legislation moreover changes could occur in the future with respect to the identity residence or holdings of our direct or indirect shareholders that could affect our eligibility for the section 883 exemption accordingly there can be no assurance that we will continue to be exempt from united states income tax on united states source shipping income in the future if we were not entitled to the benefit of section 883 we and our subsidiaries would be subject to united states taxation on a portion of the income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships which would reduce our net income see taxation of the company above for a discussion of such taxation in the absence of an exemption under section 883 

  

finally changes in the income tax laws affecting our cruise business in malta the united kingdom or elsewhere could result in higher income taxes being charged against our cruise operations resulting in lower net income 

  

  

  

we are controlled by principal shareholders that have the power to determine our policies management and actions requiring shareholder approval  

  

as of february 7 2007 a wilhelmsen as a norwegian corporation indirectly owned by members of the wilhelmsen family of norway owned approximately 202 of our common stock and cruise associates a bahamian general partnership indirectly owned by various trusts primarily for the benefit of certain members of the pritzker family and various trusts primarily for the benefit of certain members of the ofer family owned approximately 157 of our common stock a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates have the power to determine among other things 

  

• our policies and the policies of our subsidiaries 

  

• the persons who will be our directors and officers and 

  

• actions requiring shareholder approval 

  

a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates are parties to a shareholders’ agreement the agreement provides that our board of directors will consist of the following persons 

  

• four nominees of a wilhelmsen as 

  

• four nominees of cruise associates and 

  

• our chief executive officer 

  

during the term of the shareholders’ agreement certain corporate actions require the approval of at least one director nominated by a wilhelmsen as and one director nominated by cruise associates our principal shareholders are not prohibited from engaging in a business that may compete with our business subject to certain exceptions if any person other than a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates our two principal shareholders acquires ownership of more than 30 of our common stock and our two principal shareholders in the aggregate own less of our common stock than such person and do not collectively have the right to elect or to designate for election at least a majority of the board of directors we may be obligated to prepay indebtedness outstanding under the majority of our credit facilities which we may be unable to replace on similar terms if this were to occur it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity and operations 

  

the holders of our common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their equity interest as a result of the sale of currently restricted shares of our common stock into the public market  

  

a substantial number of shares of our common stock were either issued by us in private transactions not involving a public offering or are held by our affiliates and therefore the sale of these securities is subject to restrictions under the securities act of 1933 “securities act” these shares include the 202 shares of our common stock held by a wilhelmsen as and the 157 held by cruise associates no predictions can be made as to the effect if any that market sales of such shares or the availability of such shares for future market sales will have on the market price of our common stock prevailing from time to time sales of substantial amounts of our common stock or the perceptions that such sales could occur could materially adversely affect the prevailing market price for our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through an offering of equity securities each of a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates has the right pursuant to a registration rights agreement to require us subject to certain qualifications to effect the registration under the securities act of all or part of their shares of common stock which would allow these shares to be sold into the public market 

  

we are not a united states corporation and our shareholders may be subject to the uncertainties of a foreign legal system in protecting their interests  

  

our corporate affairs are governed by our restated articles of incorporation and bylaws and by the business corporation act of liberia the provisions of the business corporation act of liberia resemble provisions of the corporation laws of a number of states in the united states however while most states have a fairly well developed body 

  

  

  

of case law interpreting their respective corporate statutes there are very few judicial cases in liberia interpreting the business corporation act of liberia for example the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under liberian law are not as clearly established as the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in certain united states jurisdictions thus our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests with respect to actions by management directors or controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a united states jurisdiction

critical accounting policies 

  

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states see note 1 general and note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  certain of our accounting policies are deemed “critical” as they require management’s highest degree of judgment estimates and assumptions we have discussed these accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors we believe our most critical accounting policies are as follows 

ship accounting 

  

our ships represent our most significant assets and are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization depreciation of ships is generally computed net of a 15 projected residual value using the straightline method over estimated service lives of primarily 30 years improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized as additions to the ship and depreciated over the improvements’ estimated useful lives the estimated cost and accumulated depreciation of refurbished or replaced ship components are written off and any resulting losses are recognized in cruise operating expenses repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred we use the deferral method to account for drydocking costs under the deferral method drydocking costs incurred are deferred and charged to expense on a straightline basis over the period to the next scheduled drydock see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

our service life and residual value estimates take into consideration the impact of anticipated technological changes longterm cruise and vacation market conditions and historical useful lives of similarlybuilt ships in addition we take into consideration our estimates of the average useful lives of the ships’ major component systems such as hull superstructure main electric engines and cabins given the very large and complex nature of our ships our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain we do not have cost segregation studies performed to specifically componentize our ship systems therefore we estimate the costs of component systems based principally on general and technical information known about major ship component systems and their lives and our knowledge of the cruise vacation industry we do not identify and track depreciation by ship component systems but instead utilize these estimates to determine the net cost basis of assets replaced or refurbished 

we believe we have made reasonable estimates for ship accounting purposes however should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimates of ship service lives or projected residual values depreciation expense could be materially higher or lower if circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making determinations as to whether ship improvements should be capitalized the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance costs could increase partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense if we had reduced our estimated average 30year ship service life by one year depreciation expense for 2006 would have increased by approximately 274 million if our ships were estimated to have no residual value depreciation expense for 2006 would have increased by approximately 939 million 

  

valuation of longlived assets and goodwill 

  

we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash flows if these estimated future cash flows were less than the carrying value of the asset an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference between the asset’s estimated fair value and its carrying value 

the determination of fair value is based on quoted market prices in active markets if available such markets are often not available for used cruise ships accordingly we also base fair value on independent appraisals sales price negotiations and projected future cash flows discounted at a rate determined by management to be commensurate with our business risk the estimation of fair value utilizing discounted forecasted cash flows includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of revenues operating costs marketing selling and administrative expenses interest rates ship additions and retirements cruise vacation industry competition and general economic and business conditions among other factors 

  

  

  

goodwill and other intangible assets are reviewed annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be fully recoverable the impairment review consists of comparing the fair value of our reporting units with their carrying value including the intangible asset if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value it may be an indication of possible impairment of assets in this case we would compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value of the intangible asset if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference between the carrying value of the intangible asset and the fair value of the reporting unit we use a present value of future cash flows approach to determine the fair value of our reporting units 

we believe we have made reasonable estimates and judgments in determining whether our longlived assets and intangible assets have been impaired however if there is a material change in the assumptions used in our determination of fair values or if there is a material change in the conditions or circumstances influencing fair value we could be required to recognize a material impairment charge 

contingencies — litigation 

  

on an ongoing basis we assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss if any can be made in assessing probable losses we take into consideration estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries if any we accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recoveries it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made 

  

terminology and nongaap financial measures 

  

available passenger cruise days “apcd” are our measurement of capacity and represent double occupancy per cabin multiplied by the number of cruise days for the period 

  

gross cruise costs represent the sum of total cruise operating expenses plus marketing selling and administrative expenses 

  

gross yields represent total revenues per apcd 

  

net cruise costs represent gross cruise costs excluding commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses each of which is described below under the overview heading in measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income we believe changes in net cruise costs to be the most relevant indicator of our performance a reconciliation of historical gross cruise costs to net cruise costs is provided below under summary of historical results of operations  we have not provided a quantitative reconciliation of projected gross cruise costs to projected net cruise costs due to the significant uncertainty in projecting the costs deducted to arrive at this measure accordingly we do not believe that reconciling information for such projected figures would be meaningful 

  

net debttocapital is a ratio which represents total longterm debt including current portion of longterm debt less cash and cash equivalents “net debt” divided by the sum of net debt and shareholders equity capital we believe net debt and net debttocapital along with total longterm debt and shareholders equity are useful measures of our capital structure a reconciliation of historical debttocapital to net debttocapital is provided below under summary of historical results of operations  

  

net yields represent gross yields less commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses each of which is described below under the overview heading per apcd we utilize net yields to manage 

  

  

  

  

our business on a daytoday basis and believe that it is the most relevant measure of our pricing performance because it reflects the cruise revenues earned by us net of our most significant variable costs a reconciliation of historical gross yields to net yields is provided below under summary of historical results of operations  we have not provided a quantitative reconciliation of projected gross yields to projected net yields due to the significant uncertainty in projecting the costs deducted to arrive at this measure accordingly we do not believe that reconciling information for such projected figures would be meaningful 

  

occupancy in accordance with cruise vacation industry practice is calculated by dividing passenger cruise days by apcd a percentage in excess of 100 indicates that three or more passengers occupied some cabins 

  

passenger cruise days represent the number of passengers carried for the period multiplied by the number of days of their respective cruises 

  

overview 

  

our revenues consist of the following items 

  

passenger ticket revenues consist of revenue recognized from the sale of passenger tickets and the sale of air transportation to our ships 

  

onboard and other revenues consist primarily of revenues from the sale of goods andor services onboard our ships not included in passenger ticket prices cancellation fees sales of vacation protection insurance and pre and post cruise hotel and air packages also included are revenues we receive from independent third party concessionaires that pay us a percentage of their revenues in exchange for the right to provide selected goods andor services onboard our ships 

  

our cruise operating expenses consist of the following items 

  

commissions transportation and other expenses consist of those costs directly associated with passenger ticket revenues including travel agent commissions air and other transportation expenses port costs that vary with passenger head counts and related credit card fees 

  

onboard and other expenses consist of the direct costs associated with onboard and other revenues these costs include the cost of products sold onboard our ships vacation protection insurance premiums costs associated with pre and post tours and related credit card fees concession revenues have minimal costs associated with them as the costs related to these activities are incurred by the concessionaires 

  

payroll and related expenses consist of costs for shipboard personnel 

  

food expenses include food costs for both passengers and crew 

  

fuel expenses include fuel costs net of the financial impact of fuel swap agreements and fuel delivery costs 

  

other operating expenses consist of operating costs such as repairs and maintenance port costs that do not vary with passenger head counts insurance entertainment and all other operating costs 

  

we do not allocate payroll and related costs food costs fuel costs or other operating costs to the expense categories attributable to passenger ticket revenues or onboard and other revenues since they are incurred to provide the total cruise vacation experience 

  

summary of historical results of operations 

  

we achieved a 34  increase in net yields in 2006 as compared to 2005 marking the third consecutive year of positive yield growth this increase is primarily due to a favorable pricing environment driven by a positive demand for our products in contrast increases in fuel costs represented a challenge for us again in 2006 although price and consumption related initiatives partially mitigated the increase in fuel costs fuel expenses on an apcd basis increased 267 in 2006 as compared to 2005 as a result income before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in 2006 decreased to 6339 million or 294 per share on a fully diluted basis compared to 6635 million or 303 per share on a fully diluted basis in 2005

total revenues for 2005 increased 76 to 49 billion from total revenues of 46 billion in 2004 the increase in total revenues was primarily as a result of increases in ticket prices during 2005 net yields increased 74 and net cruise costs per apcd increased 63 compared to 2004 gross cruise costs increased 65 in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily as a result of increases in fuel expenses 

  

our revenues are seasonal based on demand for cruises demand is strongest for cruises during the summer months and holidays

outlook 

  

full year 2007 

  

on february 5 2007 we announced that bookings continued to be solid while pricing appeared to be leveling off from the appreciation experienced over the last few years we expected net yields to increase in a range around 3 as compared to 2006 we expected pullmantur’s cruise brand to account for one percentage point of this change and that its noncruise operations would contribute an additional percentage point 

  

net cruise costs per apcd were expected to increase in a range around 3 as compared to 2006 pullmantur’s cruise brand was expected to decrease net cruise costs per apcd by approximately one percentage point pullmantur’s noncruise operations were expected to increase our costs approximately four percentage points as a result of not having the benefit of additional apcds 

  

our “atthepump” fuel price was 361 per metric ton we are currently 45 hedged for 2007 and estimate that a 10 change in the market price of fuel would result in a 24 million change in fuel costs after taking into account existing hedges 

  

we expected a 122 increase in capacity driven by the acquisition of pullmantur the april delivery of liberty of the seas and a full year of service from freedom of the seas 

  

depreciation and amortization was expected to be in the range of 4800 to 5000 million and interest expense was expected to be in the range of 3350 to 3550 million in 2007 

  

based on the expectations contained in this outlook section and assuming that fuel prices remain at the level mentioned herein we expected full year 2007 earnings per share to be in the range of 305 to 320 

  

our outlook has remained unchanged since our announcement on february 5 2007 

  

first quarter 2007 

  

as announced on february 5 2007 we expected net yields to decrease in a range around 3 in the first quarter of 2007 compared to the first quarter of 2006 we expected pullmantur’s cruise brand will account for two percentage points of the change and that its noncruise operations will contribute an additional percentage point 

  

net cruise costs per apcd was expected to increase in the range of 4 to 5 compared to the first quarter of 2006 we estimated that approximately half of this increase will be driven by pullmantur’s overall operations with its cruise brand having a positive impact of approximately one percentage point 

  

our “atthepump” fuel price was 361 per metric ton and has not changed significantly since our announcement for the first quarter our fuel expense is 60 hedged we estimate that a 10 change in the market price of fuel would result in a 40 million impact on our first quarter results 

  

based on the expectations contained in this outlook section and assuming that fuel prices remain at the level mentioned herein we expected first quarter 2007 earnings per share to be in the range of 003 to 008 

  

our outlook has remained unchanged since our announcement on february 5 2007 

  

year ended december 31 2006 compared to year ended december 31 2005 

  

revenues 

  

net revenues increased 65 in 2006 compared to 2005 due to a 34 increase in net yields and a 30 increase in capacity the increase in net yields was primarily due to higher cruise ticket prices onboard spending and revenue associated with the charter of horizon to island cruises our joint venture with first choice higher cruise ticket prices were primarily attributable to a strong demand environment the increase in capacity was primarily attributed to the addition of freedom of the seas in 2006 and the lengthening of enchantment of the seas in 2005 this increase was partially offset by the charter of horizon to island cruises occupancy in 2006 was 1065 compared to 1066 in 2005 gross yields increased 35 in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to the same reasons discussed above for net yields 

  

  

  

onboard and other revenues included concession revenues of 2345 million and 2230 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively the increase in concession revenues was primarily due to the increase in capacity mentioned above and higher amounts spent per passenger onboard 

  

expenses 

  

net cruise costs increased 97 in 2006 compared to 2005 due to a 64 increase in net cruise costs per apcd and the 30 increase in capacity mentioned above approximately 40 percentage points of the increase in net cruise costs per apcd were attributed to increases in fuel expenses total fuel expenses net of the financial impact of fuel swap agreements increased 282 per metric ton in 2006 as compared to an increase of 460 per metric ton in 2005 as a percentage of total revenues fuel expenses were 92 and 75 in 2006 and 2005 respectively the remaining 24 percentage points of the increase in net cruise costs per apcd were primarily attributed to increases in marketing selling and administrative expenses associated with personnel costs gross cruise costs increased 88 in 2006 compared to 2005 which was a lower percentage increase than net cruise costs primarily due to lower trip insurance expenses a result of lower trip insurance premiums and lower commission expenses as a result of an increase in direct business 

depreciation and amortization expenses increased 49 in 2006 compared to 2005 the increase was primarily due to the addition of freedom of the seas ship improvements and shore side additions 

  

other income expense 

  

gross interest expense increased to 2957 million in 2006 from 2874 million in 2005 the increase was primarily attributable to higher interest rates partially offset by lower average debt levels interest capitalized increased to 278 million in 2006 from 177 million in 2005 primarily due to a higher average level of investment in ships under construction 

  

during 2006 we partially settled a pending lawsuit against rolls royce and alstom power conversion coproducers of the mermaid podpropulsion system on millenniumclass ships for the recurring mermaid pod failures under the terms of the partial settlement we received 380 million from alstom and released them from the suit which remains pending against rolls royce the 380 million settlement resulted in a gain of 360 million net of reimbursements to insurance companies 

  

in july 2005 first choice redeemed in full its 675 convertible preferred shares we received 3481 million in cash resulting in a net gain of 442 million primarily due to foreign exchange 

  

dividend income decreased approximately 142 million for 2006 compared to 2005 due to the redemption of our first choice investment in the third quarter of 2005 

  

cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 

  

in the third quarter of 2005 we changed our method of accounting for drydocking costs from the accrual in advance to the deferral method see note 2  summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  the change resulted in a onetime gain of 525 million or 022 per share on a diluted basis to recognize the cumulative effect of the change on prior years which we reflected as part of our results in 2005 other than this onetime gain the change did not have a material impact on our consolidated statement of operations 

  

  

  

year ended december 31 2005 compared to year ended december 31 2004 

  

revenues 

  

net revenues increased 88 in 2005 compared to 2004 due to a 74 increase in net yields and to a lesser extent a 14 increase in capacity the increase in net yields was primarily due to higher cruise ticket prices and onboard spending higher cruise ticket prices were primarily attributable to a strong demand environment and a decrease in capacity growth within the industry the increase in capacity was primarily attributed to the addition of jewel of the seas in 2004 partially offset by enchantment of the seas  which was out of service for 53 days due to its lengthening in addition capacity in 2004 was negatively impacted by the cancellation of certain sailings primarily due to hurricanes and unscheduled drydocks occupancy in 2005 was 1066 compared to 1057 in 2004 gross yields increased 62 in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to the same reasons discussed above for net yields 

  

onboard and other revenues included concession revenues of 2230 million and 1963 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively the increase in concession revenues was primarily due to higher amounts spent per passenger onboard and the increase in capacity mentioned above 

  

expenses 

  

net cruise costs increased 78 in 2005 compared to 2004 due to a 63 increase in net cruise costs per apcd and the 14 increase in capacity mentioned above approximately 49 percentage points of the increase in net cruise costs per apcd was attributed to increases in fuel expenses total fuel expenses net of the financial impact of fuel swap agreements increased 460 per metric ton in 2005 as compared to an increase of 275 in 2004 as a percentage of total revenues fuel expenses were 75 and 55 in 2005 and 2004 respectively the remaining 14 percentage points of the increase in net cruise costs per apcd were primarily attributed to increases in personnel costs associated with benefits in addition net cruise costs in 2004 included approximately 113 million in costs related to the impact of hurricanes gross cruise costs increased 65 in 2005 compared to 2004 which was a lower percentage increase than net cruise costs primarily due to a lower proportion of passengers who purchased air transportation from us in 2005 

depreciation and amortization expenses increased 20 in 2005 compared to 2004 the increase was primarily due to the addition of jewel of the seas in 2004 as well as depreciation associated with other capital expenditures including the lengthening of enchantment of the seas in 2005 

  

other income expense 

  

gross interest expense decreased to 2874 million in 2005 from 3172 million in 2004 the decrease was primarily attributable to lower average debt level partially offset by higher interest rates interest capitalized increased to 177 million in 2005 from 72 million in 2004 due to a higher average level of investment in ships under construction 

  

in july 2005 first choice redeemed in full its 675 convertible preferred shares we received 3481 million in cash resulting in a net gain of 442 million primarily due to foreign exchange 

  

cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 

  

in the third quarter of 2005 we changed our method of accounting for drydocking costs from the accrual in advance to the deferral method see note 2  summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  the change resulted in a onetime gain of 525 million or 022 per share on a diluted basis to recognize the cumulative effect of the change on prior years which we reflected as part of our results in 2005 other than this onetime gain the change did not have a material impact on our consolidated statement of operations 

  

  

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

sources and uses of cash 

  

cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity net cash provided by operating activities was 9485 million in 2006 and 11 billion in each of 2005 and 2004 this decrease was primarily a result of the payment of approximately 1212 million of accreted interest in connection with the repurchase of our lyons a decrease in accounts payable of approximately 259 million and an increase in trade and other receivables of approximately 195 million as compared to 2005 

  

net cash used in investing activities increased to 18 billion in 2006 from 890 million in 2005 and 6325 million in 2004 the increase was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures which were approximately 12 billion for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to approximately 4299 million in 2005 and 6301 million in 2004 capital expenditures were primarily related to ships under construction including the delivery of freedom of the seas in 2006 the lengthening of enchantment of the seas in 2005 and the delivery of jewel of the seas in 2004 as well as progress payments for ships under construction in all years the increase in net cash used in investing activities was also driven by the purchase of pullmantur which resulted in a cash outlay of approximately 5589 million 

  

net cash provided by financing activities was 8797 million in 2006 compared to net cash used in financing activities of 15 billion in 2005 and 1460 million in 2004 the increase in 2006 was primarily due to net proceeds from debt issuances of approximately 29 billion including net proceeds of approximately 8905 million from a public offering consisting of 5500 million of 70 senior unsecured notes due 2013 and 3500 million of 725 senior unsecured notes due 2016 in addition in connection with the financing of freedom of the seas  we entered into and drew in full a 5700 million unsecured term loan with an interest rate of 377 due through 2013 we also obtained a €7500 million or approximately 9605 million unsecured shortterm bridge loan to finance the acquisition of pullmantur on which we drew €7010 million or approximately 9251 million net cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by payments on various term loans senior notes revolving credit facilities and capital leases totaling approximately 18 billion in 2006 compared to 16 billion and 3614 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively debt repayments in 2006 included approximately 5296 million toward unsecured debt 4094 million in connection with the repurchase of our lyons 3459 million of debt repaid in connection with the acquisition of pullmantur 2600 million towards our 10 billion revolving credit facility and 2374 million towards loans secured by certain celebrity ships we also purchased 46 million shares of our common stock in 2006 from an investment bank at a price of 3599 per share as part of an asr transaction total consideration paid to repurchase such shares including commissions and other fees was approximately 1646 million the forward sale agreement matured in 2006 during the term of the forward sale agreement the investment bank purchased shares of our common stock in the open market to settle its obligation related to the shares borrowed from third parties and sold to us the shares were recorded in shareholders’ equity as a component of treasury stock see note 7 shareholders’ equity  also in 2006 we drew 5700 million on our revolving credit facility in 2005 we drew 2000 million on unsecured variable rate term loans due 2010 and 1900 million on our revolving credit facility in 2004 we drew 2250 million on an unsecured variable rate term loan due 2006 through 2012 during 2006 2005 and 2004 we received 230 million 220 million and 983 million respectively in connection with the exercise of common stock options and we paid cash dividends on our common stock of 1245 million 1188 million and 1045 million respectively in 2006 we called for redemption all of our outstanding zero coupon convertible notes due may 18 2021 most holders of the notes elected to convert them into shares of our common stock rather than redeem them for cash resulting in the issuance of approximately 41 million shares during the redemption period net debttocapital increased to 466 in 2006 compared to 420 in 2005 similarly our debttocapital ratio increased to 471 in 2006 from 428 in 2005 

  

interest capitalized during 2006 increased to 278 million from 177 million in 2005 primarily due to a higher average level of investment in ships under construction and to a lesser extent higher interest rates 

  

future capital commitments 

  

our future capital commitments consist primarily of new ship orders as of december 31 2006 we had two freedomclass ships and one ship of a new class designated for royal caribbean international and three solsticeclass ships designated for celebrity cruises  on order for an aggregate additional capacity of approximately 21150 berths 

  

  

  

the aggregate cost of the six ships is approximately 53 billion of which we have deposited 4384 million as of december 31 2006 approximately 11 of the aggregate cost of ships was exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate at december 31 2006 see note 11 financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

  

as of december 31 2006 we anticipated overall capital expenditures including the six ships on order will be approximately 13 billion for 2007 18 billion for 2008 20 billion for 2009 and 10 billion for 2010 

  

we have an option to purchase an additional ship for royal caribbean international exercisable through march 2007 for an additional capacity of approximately 5400 berths if ordered the optional ship will be delivered in the third quarter of 2010 

  

contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

as of december 31 2006 our contractual obligations were as follows in thousands  

  

       

under the brilliance of the seas operating lease we have agreed to indemnify the lessor to the extent its aftertax return is negatively impacted by unfavorable changes in corporate tax rates and capital allowance deductions these indemnifications could result in an increase in our lease payments we are unable to estimate the maximum potential increase in such lease payments due to the various circumstances timing or combination of events that could trigger such indemnifications under current circumstances we do not believe an indemnification in any material amount is probable 

  

some of the contracts that we enter into include indemnification provisions that obligate us to make payments to the counterparty if certain events occur these contingencies generally relate to changes in taxes increased lender capital costs and other similar costs the indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms and are entered into in the normal course of business there are no stated or notional amounts included in the indemnification clauses and we are not able to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments if any under these indemnification clauses we have not been required to make any payments under such indemnification clauses in the past and under current circumstances we do not believe an indemnification in any material amount is probable 

  

as a normal part of our business depending on market conditions pricing and our overall growth strategy we continuously consider opportunities to enter into contracts for the building of additional ships we may also consider the sale of ships we continuously consider potential acquisitions and strategic alliances if any of these were to occur they would be financed through the incurrence of additional indebtedness the issuance of additional shares of equity securities or through cash flows from operations

as of december 31 2006 our liquidity was 07 billion consisting of approximately 01 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 06 billion available under our unsecured revolving credit facility see note 6 longterm debt to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  we have commitments of approximately 13 billion due during the twelvemonth period ending december 31 2007 these commitments will be funded through a combination of cash flows from operations drawdowns under our available unsecured revolving credit facility the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the sales of equity or debt securities in private or public securities markets although we believe our existing unsecured revolving credit facility cash flows from operations our ability to obtain new borrowings andor raise new capital or a combination of these sources will be sufficient to fund operations debt payment requirements capital expenditures and other commitments over the next twelvemonth period there can be no assurances that these sources of cash will be available in accordance with our expectations 

  

in january 2007 we received approximately €9909 million or approximately 13 billion of net proceeds from a €10 billion or approximately 13 billion bond offering a portion of the net proceeds were used to retire the €7500 million or approximately 9605 million shortterm unsecured bridge loan obtained to finance our acquisition of pullmantur on which we drew €7010 million or approximately 9251 million the remainder of the net proceeds approximately €2890 million or approximately 3748 million was used to repay a portion of the outstanding balance on our unsecured revolving credit facility see note 14 subsequent events  

  

our financing agreements contain covenants that require us among other things to maintain minimum net worth and fixed charge coverage ratio and limit our net debttocapital ratio we were in compliance with all covenants as of december 31 2006 

  

if any person other than a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates our two principal shareholders acquires ownership of more than 30 of our common stock and our two principal shareholders in the aggregate own less of our common stock than such person and do not collectively have the right to elect or to designate for election at least a majority of the board of directors we may be obligated to prepay indebtedness outstanding under the majority of our credit facilities which we may be unable to replace on similar terms if this were to occur it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity and operations 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

financial instruments and other 

  

general 

  

we are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices we manage these risks through a combination of our normal operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments pursuant to our hedging practices and policies the financial impacts of these hedging instruments are primarily offset by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures being hedged we achieve this by closely matching the amount term and conditions of the derivative instrument with the underlying risk being hedged we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes we monitor our derivative positions using techniques including market valuations and sensitivity analyses see note 11 financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

  

interest rate risk 

  

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our longterm debt obligations and our operating lease for brilliance of the seas  at december 31 2006 60 of our longterm debt was effectively fixed and 40 was floating we enter into interest rate swap agreements to modify our exposure to interest rate movements and to manage our interest expense and rent expense 

  

market risk associated with our longterm fixed rate debt is the potential increase in fair value resulting from a decrease in interest rates at december 31 2006 our interest rate swap agreements effectively changed 1750 million of fixed rate debt with a weightedaverage fixed rate of 811 to liborbased floating rate debt the estimated fair value of our longterm fixed rate debt at december 31 2006 was 34 billion using quoted market prices where available or using discounted cash flow analyses based on market rates available to us for similar debt with the same remaining maturities the fair value of our associated interest rate swap agreements was estimated to be 56 million as of december 31 2006 based on quoted market prices for similar or identical financial instruments to those we hold a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates at december 31 2006 would increase the fair value of our longterm fixed rate debt by approximately 1587 million net of an increase in the fair value of the associated interest rate swap agreements 

  

market risk associated with our longterm floating rate debt is the potential increase in interest expense from an increase in interest rates a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase our 2007 interest expense by approximately 121 million at december 31 2006 we have an interest rate swap agreement that effectively changes 250 million of liborbased floating rate debt to fixed rate debt of 440 

  

market risk associated with our operating lease for brilliance of the seas is the potential increase in rent expense from an increase in sterling libor rates as of january 2007 we have effectively changed 50 of the operating lease obligation from a floating rate to a fixed rate obligation with a weightedaverage rate of 476 through rate fixings with the lessor a hypothetical one percentage point increase in sterling libor rates would increase our 2007 rent expense by approximately 22 million based on the exchange rate at december 31 2006 

  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

  

our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to our firm commitments under ship construction contracts denominated in euros we enter into eurodenominated forward contracts to manage this risk the estimated fair value of such eurodenominated forward contracts at december 31 2006 was a net unrealized gain of approximately 1063 million based on quoted market prices for equivalent instruments with the same remaining maturities at december 31 2006 approximately 11 of the aggregate cost of the ships was exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate a hypothetical 10 strengthening of the euro as of december 31 2006 assuming no changes in comparative interest rates would result in a 4332 million increase in the united states dollar cost of the foreign currency denominated ship construction contracts this increase would be largely offset by an increase in the fair value of our eurodenominated forward contracts 

  

  

  

we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the united states dollar value of our foreign currency denominated forecasted transactions to manage this exposure we take advantage of natural offsets of our foreign currency revenues and expenses and enter into foreign currency forward contracts for a portion of the remaining exposure related to these forecasted transactions our principal net foreign currency exposure relates to the euro the british pound and the canadian dollar at december 31 2006 the estimated fair value of such contracts was an unrealized loss of approximately 21 million based on quoted market prices for equivalent instruments with the same remaining maturities a hypothetical 10 strengthening of the principal foreign currencies as of december 31 2006 assuming no changes in comparative interest rates would result in a 288 million increase in the united states dollar value of the 2007 foreign currency denominated forecasted transactions this increase would be offset by a decrease in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts maturing in 2007 of approximately 101 million 

  

also we consider our investments in foreign subsidiaries to be denominated in relatively stable currencies and of a longterm nature we partially address the exposure of our investments in foreign subsidiaries by denominating a portion of our debt in our subsidiaries’ functional currencies generally euros specifically we have assigned debt of approximately €4788 million or approximately 6318 million as a hedge of our net investment in pullmantur and accordingly have included approximately 187 million of foreigncurrency transaction losses in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income lossat december 31 2006 a hypothetical 10 increase or decrease in the december 31 2006 foreign currency exchange rate would increase or decrease the fair value of our debt by 632 million which would be offset by a decrease or increase of 632 million in the us dollar value of our net investment 

  

fuel price risk 

  

our exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates to the consumption of fuel on our ships fuel cost net of the financial impact of fuel swap agreements as a percentage of our total revenues was approximately 92 in 2006 75 in 2005 and 55 in 2004 historically we have used fuel swap agreements to mitigate the financial impact of fluctuations in fuel prices as of december 31 2006 we had fuel swap agreements to pay fixed prices for fuel with an aggregate notional amount of approximately 2053 million maturing through 2008 the estimated fair value of these contracts at december 31 2006 was an unrealized loss of 205 million we estimate that a hypothetical 10 increase in our weightedaverage fuel price from that experienced during the year ended december 31 2006 would increase our 2007 fuel cost by approximately 525 million this increase would be partially offset by an increase in the fair value of our fuel swap agreements maturing in 2007 of approximately 182 million

royal caribbean international serves the contemporary and premium segments of the cruise vacation industry the contemporary segment is served by cruises that are generally seven nights or shorter and feature a casual ambiance the premium segment is served by cruises that are generally seven to 14 nights and appeal to the more experienced passenger who is usually more affluent royal caribbean international operates 19 cruise ships with approximately 44350 berths offering various cruise itineraries that range from two to 18 nights 

  

royal caribbean international’s strategy is to attract an array of vacationing consumers in the contemporary segment by providing a wide variety of itineraries and cruise lengths with multiple innovative options for onboard dining entertainment and other onboard activities royal caribbean international offers a wide array of onboard activities services and amenities including swimming pools sun decks beauty salons exercise and spa facilities ice skating rinks inline skating basketball courts rock climbing walls bungee jumping trampolines miniature golf courses gaming facilities lounges bars las vegasstyle entertainment cinemas and “royal promenades” which are boulevards with shopping dining and entertainment venues additionally royal caribbean international offers a variety of shore excursions at each port of call we believe that the variety and quality of royal caribbean international’s product offerings represent excellent value to consumers especially to couples and families traveling with children because of the brand’s extensive product offerings we believe royal caribbean international is well positioned to attract new consumers to the cruise vacation industry and to continue to bring past passengers back for their next vacation while the brand is positioned at the upper end of the contemporary segment we believe that royal caribbean international’s quality enables it to attract consumers from the premium segment as well thereby achieving one of the broadest market coverages of any of the major brands in the cruise vacation industry 

  

celebrity cruises brand 

  

celebrity cruises primarily serves the premium segment of the cruise vacation industry celebrity cruises operates 9 cruise ships with approximately 15100 berths and charters one ship to island cruises our joint venture with first choice holidays plc “first choice” the brand offers various cruise itineraries that range from two to 16 nights

industry 

  

since 1970 cruising has been one of the fastest growing sectors of the vacation market as the number of north american passengers has grown to an estimated 97 million in 2005 from 05 million in 1970 a compound annual growth rate of approximately 9 this growth is consistent with the growth experienced in the last five years we have sought to capitalize on the increasing popularity of cruises through an extensive fleet expansion program 

  

according to our estimates the north american cruise market was served by an estimated 109 cruise ships with approximately 137450 at the beginning of 2001 we estimate that this capacity increased to approximately 218800 berths on 132 ships by the end of 2005 the increase in capacity over the last five years is net of approximately 35 ships with approximately 30850 berths that have either been retired or moved out of the north american market there are 24 cruise ships on order with an estimated 72250 berths which will be placed in service between 2006 and 2009 

  

the following table details the growth in the north american cruise market of both passengers and weightedaverage berths over the past five years 

  

  

    

cruise lines compete for consumers’ disposable leisure time spending with other vacation alternatives such as landbased resort hotels and sightseeing destinations demand for such activities is influenced by geopolitical and general economic conditions we believe that cruise passengers currently represent only a small share of the vacation market and that a significant portion of cruise passengers carried are firsttime cruisers 

  

our ships operate worldwide and have itineraries that call on destinations in alaska the bahamas bermuda california canada the caribbean europe the galapagos islands hawaii mexico new england the panama canal and south america 

  

we compete with a number of cruise lines however our principal competitors are carnival corporation  plc which owns among others carnival cruise lines princess cruises holland america line costa cruises po cruises and cunard line star cruises which owns among others star cruises and norwegian cruise line mediterranean shipping company which owns msc cruises and disney cruise line we compete principally on the basis of quality of ships quality of service variety of itineraries and price

our principal operating strategies are to

brand awareness 

  

we continue to broaden the recognition of both the royal caribbean international brand and the celebrity cruises brand among consumers royal caribbean international is an established brand in the contemporary and premium segments of the cruise vacation industry we believe we are positioning celebrity cruises brand as the best choice in the premium segment of the cruise vacation industry each brand has a distinct identity and marketing focus but utilizes shared infrastructure resources

fleet expansion 

  

based on the ships currently on order our capacity is expected to increase to approximately 81500 berths by december 31 2009 since our first fleet expansion program beginning in 1988 we have continued to increase our average ship size and number of available berths which has enabled us to achieve certain economies of scale larger ships allow us to carry more passengers without a corresponding increase in certain operating expenses 

  

royal caribbean international founded in 1968 royal caribbean international was the first cruise line to design cruise ships especially for warm water yearround cruising royal caribbean international operated a modern fleet in the 1970s and early 1980s establishing a reputation for high quality between 1988 and 1992 the brand tripled its capacity by embarking on its first major capital expansion program and taking delivery of three sovereignclass ships from 1995 through 1998 royal caribbean international completed its second capital expansion program by taking delivery of six visionclass ships ranging in size from approximately 1800 to 2000 berths during this same period royal caribbean international sold four of its older ships because their age and design were no longer consistent with its image and marketing strategy 

  

royal caribbean international began its third capital expansion program with orders for five voyagerclass ships and four radianceclass ships the voyagerclass ships were placed in service from 1999 through 2003 each ship is approximately 140000 gross tons with approximately 3100 berths this class of ships is designed to provide more diverse vacation options for families and for those seeking active sports and entertainment alternatives during their vacation experience each voyagerclass ship has a variety of unique features including the cruise vacation industry’s first horizontal atrium the “royal promenade” which is four decks tall longer than a football field and provides entertainment shopping and dining experiences recreational activities such as ice skating inline skating rock climbing miniature golf and full court basketball enhanced staterooms expanded dining venues and a variety of intimate spaces

segment reporting 

  

we operate two cruise brands royal caribbean international and celebrity cruises the brands have been aggregated as a single operating segment based on the similarity of their economic characteristics as well as products and services provided for financial information see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

  

employees 

  

as of december 31 2005 we employed approximately 3800 fulltime and 600 parttime employees worldwide in our shoreside operations we also employed approximately 35000 shipboard employees as of december 31 2005 approximately 780 of our shipboard employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements we believe that our relationship with our employees is good 

  

suppliers 

  

our largest purchases are for travel agency services fuel port facility utilization food airline transportation advertising hotel supplies and products related to passenger accommodations most of the supplies we require are available from numerous sources at competitive prices none of our suppliers provided goods or services in excess of 10 of our total revenues in 2005 

  

insurance 

  

we maintain insurance on the hull and machinery of our ships which includes additional coverage for disbursements earnings and increased value which are maintained in amounts related to the value of each ship the coverage for each of the hull policies is maintained with syndicates of insurance underwriters from the british scandinavian french united states and other international insurance markets 

  

we maintain liability protection and indemnity insurance on each of our ships through either assuranceforeningen gard or the united kingdom mutual steam ship assurance association bermuda limited 

  

  

  

  

  

we maintain war risk insurance including terrorist risk insurance on each ship through a norwegian war risk insurance organization in an amount equal to the total insured hull value this coverage includes coverage for physical damage to the ship which is not covered under the hull policies as a result of war exclusion clauses in such hull policies we also maintain protection and indemnity war risk coverage for risks that would be excluded by the rules of the indemnity insurance organizations subject to certain limitations consistent with most marine war risk policies under the terms of our war risk insurance coverage underwriters can give seven days notice to us that the policy will be canceled and reinstated at higher premium rates 

  

we also maintain a form of business interruption insurance with our insurance underwriters in the event that a ship is unable to operate during scheduled cruise periods due to loss or damage to the ship arising from certain covered events that last more than a specified period of time we also maintain insurance coverage for certain events which would result in a delayed delivery of our contracted new ships which we normally place starting approximately two years prior to the scheduled delivery dates 

  

insurance coverage for shoreside property onboard consumables and inventory and general liability risks are maintained with insurance underwriters in the united states and the united kingdom we have decided not to carry business interruption insurance for shoreside operations based on our evaluation of the risks involved and our protective measures already in place as compared to the premium expense 

  

all insurance coverage is subject to certain limitations exclusions and deductible levels in addition in certain circumstances we coinsure a portion of these risks premiums charged by insurance carriers including carriers in the maritime insurance industry increase or decrease from time to time and tend to be cyclical in nature these cycles are impacted both by our own loss experience and by losses incurred in direct and reinsurance markets we historically have been able to obtain insurance coverage in amounts and at premiums we have deemed to be commercially acceptable no assurance can be given that affordable and secure insurance markets will be available to us in the future particularly for war risk insurance 

  

the athens convention relating to the carriage of passengers and their luggage by sea 1974 and the 1976 protocol to the athens convention are generally applicable to passenger ships the united states has not ratified the athens convention however with limited exceptions the 1976 athens convention protocol may be contractually enforced with respect to those of our cruises that do not call at a united states port the international maritime organization diplomatic conference agreed upon a new protocol to the athens convention on november 1 2002 the 2002 protocol which is not yet in force substantially increases the level of compulsory insurance which must be maintained by passenger ship operators no assurance can be given as to if or when the 2002 protocol will come into force if in force no assurance can be given that affordable and secure insurance markets will be available to provide the level of coverage required under the 2002 protocol 

  

trademarks 

  

we own a number of registered trademarks related to the royal caribbean international and celebrity cruises brands including the name “royal caribbean” and its crown and anchor logo the name “celebrity cruises” and its “x” logo and the names of our cruise ships we believe such trademarks are widely recognized throughout the world and have considerable value 

  

regulation 

  

our ships are regulated by various international national state and local laws regulations and treaties in force in the jurisdictions in which they operate in addition all of our ships are registered in the bahamas with the exception of the celebrity xpedition  which is registered in ecuador each ship is subject to regulations issued by its country of registry including regulations issued pursuant to international treaties governing the safety of the ship and its passengers each country of registry conducts periodic inspections to verify compliance with these regulations ships operating out of united states ports are subject to inspection by the united states coast guard for compliance with international treaties and by the united states public health service for sanitary conditions our ships are also subject to similar inspections pursuant to the laws and regulations of various other countries our ships visit 

  

  

  

  

  

our ships are required to comply with international safety standards defined in the safety of life at sea convention the safety of life at sea convention standards are revised from time to time and the most recent modifications are being phased in through 2010 we do not anticipate that we will be required to make any material expenditures in order to comply with these rules 

  

we are required to obtain certificates from the united states federal maritime commission relating to our ability to meet liability in cases of nonperformance of obligations to passengers as well as casualty and personal injury pursuant to the united states federal maritime commission regulations we arrange through our insurers for the provision of guarantees aggregating 45 million for our shipoperating companies as a condition to obtaining the required certificates the united states federal maritime commission has proposed various revisions to the financial responsibility regulations which could require us to significantly increase the amount of our bonds and accordingly increase our costs of compliance 

  

we are also required by the united kingdom and other jurisdictions to establish our financial responsibility for any liability resulting from the nonperformance of our obligations to passengers from these jurisdictions in the united kingdom we are currently required by the united kingdom passenger shipping association and united kingdom civil aviation authority to provide performance bonds totaling approximately £370 million 

  

we are subject to various united states and international laws and regulations relating to environmental protection under such laws and regulations we are prohibited from among other things discharging certain materials such as petrochemicals and plastics into the waterways we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations from time to time environmental and other regulators consider more stringent regulations which may affect our operations and increase our compliance costs we believe that the impact of cruise ships on the global environment will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world and accordingly this will likely subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 

  

we are required to obtain certificates from the united states coast guard relating to our ability to satisfy liability in cases of water pollution pursuant to united states coast guard regulations we arrange through our insurers for the provision of guarantees aggregating 287 million as a condition to obtaining the required certificates 

  

we believe that we are in material compliance with all the regulations applicable to our ships and that we have all licenses necessary to conduct our business health safety security and financial responsibility issues are and we believe will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant government authorities in the united states and internationally from time to time various regulatory and legislative changes may be proposed that could impact our operations and would likely subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 

  

taxation of the company 

  

the following discussion of the application of the united states federal income tax laws to us and to our subsidiaries is based on the current provisions of the united states internal revenue code of 1986 as amended treasury department regulations administrative rulings and court decisions all of the foregoing is subject to change and any such change could affect the accuracy of this discussion 

  

application of section 883 of the internal revenue code 

  

we and our subsidiary celebrity cruises inc the operator of celebrity cruises are foreign corporations engaged in a trade or business in the united states and our shipowning subsidiaries are foreign corporations that in many cases depending upon the itineraries of their ships receive income from sources within the united states under section 883 of the internal revenue code certain foreign corporations are not subject to united states income or branch profits tax on united states source income derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships including income from the leasing of such ships 

a foreign corporation will qualify for the benefits of section 883 if in relevant part 1 the foreign country in which the foreign corporation is organized grants an equivalent exemption to corporations organized in the united states and 2a more than 50 of the value of the corporation’s capital stock is owned directly or indirectly by individuals who are residents of a foreign country that grants such an equivalent exemption to corporations organized in the united states or b the stock of the corporation or the direct or indirect corporate parent thereof is “primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market” in the united states or another qualifying country such as norway in the opinion of our 

  

  

  

  

united states tax counsel drinker biddle  reath llp based on the representations and assumptions set forth in that opinion we celebrity cruises inc and our shipowning subsidiaries qualify for the benefits of section 883 because we and each of those subsidiaries are incorporated in liberia which is a qualifying country and our common stock is primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market in the united states or norway 

  

we believe that most of our income and the income of our shipowning subsidiaries is derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships and therefore is exempt from taxation under section 883 in 2005 final regulations became effective under section 883 which among other things narrow somewhat the scope of activities that are considered by the internal revenue service to be incidental to the international operation of ships the activities listed in the regulations as not being incidental to the international operation of ships include income from the sale of air and land transportation shore excursions and pre and post cruise tours to the extent the income from these activities is earned from sources within the united states that income will be subject to united states taxation but the determination of the precise amount of such united states source income involves some uncertainties the tax impact of these new regulations reduced our net income for the year ended december 31 2005 by approximately 14 million and we anticipate tax impacts in subsequent years on an ongoing basis 

  

under certain circumstances changes in the identity residence or holdings of our direct or indirect shareholders could cause our common stock not to be “regularly traded on an established securities market” within the meaning of the regulations under section 883 to substantially reduce any such risk in may 2000 our articles of incorporation were amended to prohibit any person other than our two existing largest shareholders from owning as determined for purposes of section 883c3 of the internal revenue code and the regulations promulgated thereunder shares that give such person in the aggregate more than 49 of the relevant class or classes of our shares under liberian law this amendment may not be enforceable with respect to shares of common stock that were voted against the amendment or that were recorded as abstaining from the vote 

  

also it should be noted that section 883 has been the subject of legislative modifications in past years that have had the effect of limiting its availability to certain taxpayers and there can be no assurance that future legislation will not preclude us from obtaining the benefits of section 883 at this time however there is no known limiting legislation pending before the united states congress 

  

taxation in the absence of an exemption under section 883 of the internal revenue code 

  

if we celebrity cruises inc or our shipowning subsidiaries were to fail to meet the requirements of section 883 of the internal revenue code or if the provision was repealed then as explained below such companies would be subject to united states income taxation on a portion of their income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships 

  

because we and celebrity cruises inc conduct a trade or business in the united states we and celebrity cruises inc would be taxable at regular corporate rates on our separate company taxable income ie without regard to the income of our shipowning subsidiaries from united states sources which includes 100 of income if any from transportation that begins and ends in the united states not including possessions of the united states 50 of income from transportation that either begins or ends in the united states and no income from transportation that neither begins nor ends in the united states the legislative history of the transportation income source rules suggests that a cruise that begins and ends in a united states port but that calls on more than one foreign port will derive united states source income only from the first and last legs of such cruise this conclusion is not free from doubt however because there are no regulations or other internal revenue service interpretations of the above rules in addition if any of our earnings and profits effectively connected with our united states trade or business were withdrawn or were deemed to have been withdrawn from our united states trade or business those withdrawn amounts would be subject to a “branch profits” tax at the rate of 30 the amount of such earnings and profits would be equal to the aforesaid united states source income with certain generally minor adjustments less income taxes we and celebrity cruises inc would also be potentially subject to tax on portions of certain interest paid by us at rates of up to 30 

  

  

  

  

if section 883 was not available to our shipowning subsidiaries each such subsidiary would be subject to a special 4 tax on its united states source gross transportation income if any each year because it does not have a fixed place of business in the united states and its income is derived from the leasing of a ship such united states source gross transportation income may be determined under any reasonable method including ratios of days traveling directly to or from united states ports to total days traveling or of the lessee’s united states source gross income from the ship as determined under the source rules discussed in the preceding paragraph and subject to the assumptions and qualifications set forth therein to the lessee’s total gross income from the ship

 item 1a risk factors 

  

the risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k are important factors among others that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historic results it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently this list should not be considered a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a note regarding forwardlooking statements 

  

we may lose business to competitors throughout the vacation market  

  

we operate in the vacation market and cruising is one of many alternatives for people choosing a vacation we therefore risk losing business not only to other cruise lines but also to other vacation operators which provide other leisure options including hotels resorts and package holidays and tours 

  

we face significant competition from other cruise lines both on the basis of cruise pricing and also in terms of the nature of ships and services we offer to cruise passengers our principal competitors within the cruise vacation industry include carnival corporation  plc which owns among others carnival cruise lines princess cruises holland america line costa cruises po cruises and cunard line star cruises which owns among others star cruises and norwegian cruise line mediterranean shipping company which owns msc cruises and disney cruise line 

  

in the event that we do not compete effectively with other vacation alternatives and cruise companies our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

  

overcapacity within the cruise vacation industry a reduction in demand or geopolitical and economic uncertainties could have a negative impact on revenues result in impairment of assets and may adversely affect profitability  

  

cruising capacity has grown in recent years and we expect it to increase further as the major cruise vacation companies introduce new ships demand for cruises has been and is expected to continue to be dependent on the strength of the economies in the countries in which we market our products the public’s attitude towards the safety of travel and the geopolitical climate economic or political changes may reduce demand for cruise vacations and may lead to reduced occupancy andor price discounting which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and could result in impairment of our asset values 

  

fears of terrorist attacks war and other hostilities and the spread of contagious diseases could have a negative impact on our profitability  

  

events such as terrorist attacks war and other hostilities the spread of contagious diseases and the resulting political instability travel restrictions and concerns over safety health and security aspects of traveling have had and could have in the future a significant adverse impact on demand and pricing in the travel and vacation industry these events could also impact our ability to source qualified crew from throughout the world at competitive costs and therefore increase our shipboard employee costs 

  

incidents or adverse publicity concerning the cruise vacation industry or unusual weather conditions could affect our reputation and harm our future sales and profitability  

the operation of cruise ships involves the risk of accidents illnesses and other incidents which may bring into question passenger safety health security and vacation satisfaction and thereby adversely affect future industry performance incidents involving cruise ships adverse media publicity concerning the cruise vacation industry or unusual weather patterns or natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes could impact demand and consequently have an adverse impact on our profitability 

  

  

  

  

  

environmental health and safety financial responsibility and other maritime regulations could affect operations and increase operating costs  

  

the united states and various state and foreign government or regulatory agencies have enacted or are considering new environmental regulations or policies that could adversely impact the cruise vacation industry some environmental groups have lobbied for more stringent regulation of cruise ships and have generated negative publicity about the cruise vacation industry and its environmental impact in addition we are subject to various international national state and local laws regulations and treaties that govern among other things safety standards applicable to our ships health and sanitary standards applicable to our passengers security standards on board our ships and at the shipport interface areas and financial responsibilities to our passengers these issues are and we believe will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world this could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise ships that would subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 

in 2005 the united states issued a proposed western hemisphere travel initiative which would require united states citizens to have a passport or other accepted identity document to travel to or from certain countries or areas that were previously exempt such as canada mexico central and south america and the caribbean the proposal is currently expected to be implemented as of december 31 2006 for all united states citizens traveling to or from these destinations by air and sea and as of december 31 2007 for all travel by land border crossings many of our united states cruise passengers visiting these destinations currently do not have passports and it is therefore likely that these regulations will have a negative impact on our bookings when they are implemented 

  

we may not be able to obtain financing on terms that are favorable or consistent with our expectations  

  

to fund our capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments we rely on a combination of cash flows provided by operations drawdowns under our available credit facility the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the sales of equity or debt securities in private or public securities markets our credit ratings impact our ability to obtain financing in financial markets and the terms of the financing any lowering of our credit ratings may have adverse consequences on our ability to access the financial markets andor on our cost of financings in addition interest rates and our ability to obtain financing are dependent on many economic and political factors beyond our control accordingly we cannot be sure that our cash flows from operations and additional financings will be available in accordance with our expectations 

  

conducting business internationally may result in increased costs and other risks  

  

we operate our business internationally and plan to continue to develop our international presence operating internationally exposes us to a number of risks examples include political risks and risk of increases in duties and taxes as well as changes in laws and policies affecting cruising vacation or maritime businesses or governing the operations of foreignbased companies additional risks include currency fluctuations interest rate movements imposition of trade barriers and restrictions on repatriation of earnings if we are unable to address these risks adequately our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

  

we have ship construction contracts which are denominated in euros while we have entered into euro denominated forward contracts to manage a portion of the currency risk associated with these ship construction contracts we are exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate for the portion of the ship construction contracts that has not been hedged if the shipyard is unable to perform under the related ship construction contract any foreign currency hedges that were entered into to manage the currency risk would need to be terminated termination of these contracts could result in a significant loss 

ship construction delays or mechanical faults may result in cancellation of cruises and unscheduled drydocks and repairs  

  

  

  

  

  

we depend on shipyards to construct and deliver our cruise ships on a timely basis and in good working order the sophisticated nature of building a ship involves risks delays or mechanical faults in ship construction have in the past and may in the future result in delays or cancellation of cruises or necessitate unscheduled drydocks and repairs of ships shipyard insolvency and other industrial actions could also delay or indefinitely postpone the timely delivery of new ships we have experienced mechanical problems with the pod propulsion units on certain ships and there can be no assurance that we will not experience such problems in the future these events together with any related adverse publicity could to the extent they are not covered by contractual provisions or insurances adversely affect our financial results 

  

our operating costs and taxes could increase due to market forces and economic or political factors beyond our control 

  

our operating costs including fuel food payroll insurance and security costs are subject to increases due to market forces and economic or political instability or other factors beyond our control increases in these operating costs could adversely affect our profitability in addition united states state and local authorities as well as foreign authorities periodically consider increases in taxes for instance initiatives are currently pending in alaska which if adopted would impose taxes and other costs on us and our cruise passengers the implementation of these and other taxes could also cause an increase in our costs 

  

unavailability of ports of call may adversely affect our profits  

  

we believe that port destinations are a major reason why passengers choose to go on a particular cruise or on a cruise vacation the availability of ports is affected by a number of factors including but not limited to existing capacity constraints security concerns adverse weather conditions and natural disasters financial limitations on port development local governmental regulations and local community concerns about port development and other adverse impacts on their communities from additional tourists any limitations on the availability of our ports of call could adversely affect our profits 

  

a change in our tax status under the united states internal revenue code may have adverse effects on our income  

  

we and a number of our subsidiaries are foreign corporations that derive income from a united states trade or business andor from sources within the united states drinker biddle  reath llp our united states tax counsel has delivered to us an opinion based on certain representations and assumptions set forth in it to the effect that this income to the extent derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships is exempt from united states income tax pursuant to section 883 of the internal revenue code we believe that most of our income including that of our subsidiaries is derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships 

  

in 2005 final regulations under section 883 became effective which narrowed somewhat the scope of activities that are considered by the internal revenue service to be incidental to the international operation of ships to the extent the income from nonincidental activities is earned from sources within the united states that income will be subject to united states taxation but the determination of the precise amount of such untied states source income involves some uncertainties the tax impact of these new regulations reduced our net income for the year ended december 31 2005 by approximately 14 million and we anticipate tax impacts in subsequent years on an ongoing basis 

  

it should also be noted that the provisions of section 883 are subject to change at any time by legislation moreover changes could occur in the future with respect to the identity residence or holdings of our direct or indirect shareholders that could affect our eligibility for the section 883 exemption accordingly there can be no assurance that we will continue to be exempt from united states income tax on united states source shipping income in the future if we were not entitled to the benefit of section 883 we and our subsidiaries would be subject to united states taxation on a portion of the income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships which would reduce our net income see taxation of the company above for a discussion of such taxation in the absence of an exemption under section 883 

we are controlled by principal shareholders that have the power to determine our policies management and actions requiring shareholder approval  

  

  

  

  

  

as of february 10 2006 a wilhelmsen as a norwegian corporation indirectly owned by members of the wilhelmsen family of norway owned approximately 204 of our common stock and cruise associates a bahamian general partnership indirectly owned by various trusts primarily for the benefit of certain members of the pritzker family and various trusts primarily for the benefit of certain members of the ofer family owned approximately 158 of our common stock a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates have the power to determine among other things 

  

• our policies and the policies of our subsidiaries 

  

• the persons who will be our directors and officers and 

  

• actions requiring shareholder approval 

  

a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates are parties to a shareholders’ agreement the agreement provides that our board of directors will consist of the following persons 

  

• four nominees of a wilhelmsen as 

  

• four nominees of cruise associates and 

  

• our chief executive officer 

  

during the term of the shareholders’ agreement certain corporate actions require the approval of at least one director nominated by a wilhelmsen as and one director nominated by cruise associates our principal shareholders are not prohibited from engaging in a business that may compete with our business subject to certain exceptions if any person other than a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates our two principal shareholders acquires ownership of more than 30 of our common stock and our two principal shareholders in the aggregate own less of our common stock than such person and do not collectively have the right to elect or to designate for election at least a majority of the board of directors we may be obligated to prepay indebtedness outstanding under the majority of our credit facilities which we may be unable to replace on similar terms if this were to occur it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity and operations 

  

the holders of our common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their equity interest as a result of the sale of currently restricted shares of our common stock into the public market  

  

a substantial number of shares of our common stock were either issued by us in private transactions not involving a public offering or are held by our affiliates and therefore the sale of these securities is subject to restrictions under the securities act of 1933 “securities act” these shares include the 204 shares of our common stock held by a wilhelmsen as and the 158 held by cruise associates no predictions can be made as to the effect if any that market sales of such shares or the availability of such shares for future market sales will have on the market price of our common stock prevailing from time to time sales of substantial amounts of our common stock or the perceptions that such sales could occur could materially adversely affect the prevailing market price for our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through an offering of equity securities each of a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates has the right pursuant to a registration rights agreement to require us subject to certain qualifications to effect the registration under the securities act of all or part of their shares of common stock which would allow these shares to be sold into the public market 

  

we are not a united states corporation and our shareholders may be subject to the uncertainties of a foreign legal system in protecting their interests  

  

our corporate affairs are governed by our restated articles of incorporation and bylaws and by the business corporation act of liberia the provisions of the business corporation act of liberia resemble provisions of the corporation laws of a number of states in the united states however while most states have a fairly well developed body of case law interpreting their respective corporate statutes there are very few judicial cases in liberia interpreting the business corporation act of liberia for example the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under liberian law are not as clearly established as the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under statutes or judicial 

  

  

  

  

precedent in existence in certain united states jurisdictions thus our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests with respect to actions by management directors or controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a united states jurisdiction

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

in april 2005 a purported class action lawsuit was filed in the united states district court for the southern district of florida alleging that celebrity cruises improperly requires its cabin stewards to share guest gratuities with assistant cabin stewards the suit seeks payment of damages including penalty wages under 46 usc section 10113 of us law and interest we are not able at this time to estimate the impact of this proceeding on us however we believe that we have meritorious defenses and we intend to vigorously defend against this action 

  

in may 2005 a purported class action lawsuit was filed in the united states district court for the southern district of florida alleging that we improperly profit from shore excursions offered to our guests by third party shore excursion operators in violation of the florida deceptive and unfair trade practices act the suit sought payment of damages including the difference between what we collect from our guests for shore excursions and what we pay to the shore excursion operators in september 2005 the court granted our motion to dismiss the lawsuit 

  

in january 2006 a purported class action lawsuit was filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york alleging that we infringed rights in copyrighted works and other intellectual property by presenting performances on our cruise ships without securing the necessary licenses the suit seeks payment of damages disgorgement of profits and a permanent injunction against future infringement we are not able at this time to estimate the impact of this preceding on us 

  

we are routinely involved in other claims typical within the cruise vacation industry the majority of these claims is covered by insurance we believe the outcome of such claims net of expected insurance recoveries will not have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition results of operations or liquidity

critical accounting policies 

  

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states see note 1 general and note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  certain of our accounting policies are deemed “critical” as they require management’s highest degree of judgment estimates and assumptions we have discussed these accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors we believe our most critical accounting policies are as follows 

  

ship accounting 

  

our ships represent our most significant assets and are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization depreciation of ships which includes amortization of ships under capital leases is computed net of a 15 projected residual value using the straightline method over estimated service lives of primarily 30 years improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized as additions to the ship and depreciated over the improvements’ estimated useful lives the estimated cost and accumulated depreciation of refurbished or replaced ship components are writtenoff and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in cruise operating expenses repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred in the third quarter of 2005 we changed our method of accounting for drydocking costs from the accrual in advance to the deferral method under the accrual in advance method estimated drydocking costs are accrued evenly over the period to the next scheduled drydock under the deferral method drydocking costs incurred are deferred and charged to expense on a straightline basis over the period to the next scheduled drydock see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

  

our service life and residual value estimates take into consideration the impact of anticipated technological changes longterm cruise and vacation market conditions and historical useful lives of similarlybuilt ships in addition we take into consideration our estimates of the average useful lives of the ships’ major component systems such as hull superstructure main electric engines and cabins given the very large and complex nature of our ships our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain we do not have cost segregation studies performed to specifically componentize our ship systems therefore we estimate the costs of component systems based principally on general and technical information known about major ship component systems and their lives and our knowledge of the cruise vacation industry we do not identify and track depreciation by ship component systems but instead utilize these estimates to determine the net cost basis of assets replaced or refurbished 

  

we believe we have made reasonable estimates for ship accounting purposes however should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimates of ship service lives or projected residual values depreciation expense could be materially higher or lower if circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making determinations as to whether ship improvements should be capitalized the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance costs could increase partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense if we had reduced our estimated average 30year ship service life by one year depreciation expense for 2005 would have increased by approximately 17 million if our ships were estimated to have no residual value depreciation expense for 2005 would have increased by approximately 77 million 

  

valuation of longlived assets and goodwill 

  

we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash flows if these estimated future cash flows were less than the carrying value of the asset an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference between the asset’s estimated fair value and its carrying value 

  

the determination of fair value is based on quoted market prices in active markets if available such markets are often not available for used cruise ships accordingly we also base fair value on independent appraisals sales price negotiations and projected future cash flows discounted at a rate determined by management to be commensurate with our 

  

  

  

  

business risk the estimation of fair value utilizing discounted forecasted cash flows includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of revenues operating costs marketing selling and administrative expenses interest rates ship additions and retirements cruise vacation industry competition and general economic and business conditions among other factors 

  

goodwill is reviewed annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be fully recoverable the impairment review consists of comparing the fair value of goodwill to the carrying value if the carrying value exceeds the fair value an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value we use the market capitalization method in determining the fair value of our goodwill if under certain circumstances this method is not representative of fair value we use a present value of future cash flows approach 

  

we believe we have made reasonable estimates and judgments in determining whether our longlived assets and goodwill have been impaired however if there is a material change in the assumptions used in our determination of fair values or if there is a material change in the conditions or circumstances influencing fair value we could be required to recognize a material impairment charge 

  

contingencies — litigation 

  

on an ongoing basis we assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss if any can be made in assessing probable losses we take into consideration estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries if any we accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recoveries it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made 

  

terminology and nongaap financial measures 

  

available passenger cruise days “apcd” are our measurement of capacity and represent double occupancy per cabin multiplied by the number of cruise days for the period 

  

gross cruise costs represent the sum of total cruise operating expenses plus marketing selling and administrative expenses 

  

gross yields represent total revenues per apcd 

  

net cruise costs represent gross cruise costs excluding commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses each of which is described below under the overview heading in measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income we believe changes in net cruise costs to be the most relevant indicator of our performance a reconciliation of historical gross cruise costs to net cruise costs is provided below under summary of historical results of operations  we have not provided a quantitative reconciliation of projected gross cruise costs to projected net cruise costs due to the significant uncertainty in projecting the costs deducted to arrive at this measure accordingly we do not believe that reconciling information for such projected figures would be meaningful 

  

net yields represent gross yields less commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses each of which is described below under the overview heading per apcd we utilize net yields to manage our business on a daytoday basis and believe that it is the most relevant measure of our pricing performance because it reflects the cruise revenues earned by us net of our most significant variable costs a reconciliation of historical gross yields to net yields is provided below under summary of historical results of operations  we have not provided a quantitative reconciliation of projected gross yields to projected net yields due to the significant uncertainty in projecting the costs deducted to arrive at this measure accordingly we do not believe that reconciling information for such projected figures would be meaningful 

  

  

  

  

occupancy in accordance with cruise vacation industry practice is calculated by dividing passenger cruise days by apcd a percentage in excess of 100 indicates that three or more passengers occupied some cabins 

  

passenger cruise days represent the number of passengers carried for the period multiplied by the number of days of their respective cruises 

  

overview 

  

our revenues consist of the following 

  

passenger ticket revenues consist of revenue recognized from the sale of passenger tickets and the sale of air transportation to our ships 

  

onboard and other revenues consist primarily of revenues from the sale of goods andor services onboard our ships cancellation fees sales of vacation protection insurance and pre and post tours also included are revenues we receive from independent third party concessionaires that pay us a percentage of their revenues in exchange for the right to provide selected goods andor services onboard our ships 

  

our cruise operating expenses consist of the following 

  

commissions transportation and other expenses consist of those costs directly associated with passenger ticket revenues including travel agent commissions air and other transportation expenses port costs that vary with passenger head counts and related credit card fees 

  

onboard and other expenses consist of the direct costs associated with onboard and other revenues these costs include the cost of products sold onboard our ships vacation protection insurance premiums costs associated with pre and post tours and related credit card fees concession revenues have minimal costs associated with them as the costs related to these activities are incurred by the concessionaires 

  

payroll and related expenses consist of costs for shipboard personnel 

  

food expenses include food costs for both passengers and crew 

  

fuel expenses include fuel costs net of the financial impact of fuel swap agreements and fuel delivery costs 

  

other operating expenses consist of operating costs such as repairs and maintenance port costs that do not vary with passenger head counts insurance entertainment and all other operating costs 

  

we do not allocate payroll and related costs food costs fuel costs or other operating costs to the expense categories attributable to passenger ticket revenues or onboard and other revenues since they are incurred to provide the total cruise vacation experience 

  

summary of historical results of operations 

  

we have operated under an exceptionally strong demand environment over the past two years comparable to pre911 levels in addition the rate of capacity growth within the industry decreased significantly to approximately 45 in 2005 from approximately 132 in 2004 these trends contributed to a favorable pricing environment for our products and allowed us to achieve significant net yield increases in 2005 in contrast increasing fuel costs represented a significant challenge for us during 2005 record crude oil prices combined with refining capacity shortfalls helped to increase “at the pump” prices to record levels although price and consumption related initiatives partially mitigated these increases fuel costs on an apcd basis increased 44 during 2005 as compared to 2004 despite the significant increases in fuel costs we achieved the best financial performance in our history 

  

highlights for 2005 included 

  

   

  

  

  

in 2003 included in our results for 2005 is a net gain of 442 million primarily due to foreign exchange on the redemption of our investment in first choice holiday plc “first choice” 

  

   

   

   

   

   

total revenues for 2004 increased 204 to 46 billion from total revenues of 38 billion in 2003 the increase in total revenues was a result of a 103 increase in capacity along with increases in cruise ticket prices occupancy levels and onboard revenues as consumer sentiment towards leisure travel improved in 2004 during 2004 net yields increased 92 and net cruise costs per apcd increased 56 compared to 2003 gross cruise costs increased 177 in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily as a result of increases in capacity commission expense associated with higher cruise ticket prices and higher fuel prices in addition in 2004 we incurred costs of approximately 113 million related to the impact of hurricanes 

  

our revenues are seasonal based on demand for cruises demand is strongest for cruises during the summer months and holidays

outlook 

  

full year 2006 

  

bookings and pricing levels continue to be solid as a result we forecast net yields for the full year 2006 will increase in the range of 2 to 4 compared to 2005 as announced on february 2 2006 “atthepump” fuel price was 425 per metric ton which is 19 higher than the average price for 2005 of 358 per metric ton if fuel prices for the rest of the year remain at that level we estimate that our 2006 fuel costs net of hedging and fuel savings initiatives will increase approximately 90 million fuel prices have not changed significantly since our announcement on february 2 2006 

  

commencing with the first quarter of 2006 we will adopt the new stockbased compensation accounting standard and begin expensing stock options which is expected to increase 2006 full year expenses by 12 million 

  

based on the above we estimate that net cruise costs per apcd for 2006 will increase in the range of 3 to 5 as compared to the prior year higher fuel costs account for 30 to 40 percentage points of this increase additionally 2006 will be another year of minimal capacity increases capacity will grow more substantially in 2007 and beyond providing us with improved economies of scale to offset normal cost increases 

  

depreciation and amortization is expected to be in the range of 425 to 445 million and net interest expense is expected to be in the range of 245 to 265 million 

  

in january 2006 we partially settled a pending lawsuit against rolls royce and alstom power conversion “alstom” coproducers of the mermaid podpropulsion system on millenniumclass ships for the recurring mermaid pod failures under the terms of the partial settlement we received 380 million from alstom and released them from the suit which remains pending against rolls royce the 380 million settlement resulted in an estimated gain of 360 million net of estimated reimbursements to insurance companies which will be recorded in other income during the first quarter of 2006 

  

based upon the expectations and assumptions contained in this outlook section including the legal settlement with alstom of 016 per share we expect full year 2006 earnings per share to be in the range of 295 to 315 

  

first quarter 2006 

  

expectations for the first quarter of 2006 are somewhat different than the full year due to seasonal revenue patterns and the timing of certain expenses we expect net yields for the first quarter of 2006 will increase in the range of 1 to 2 compared to the first quarter of 2005 

  

  

  

  

we estimate that net cruise costs per apcd for the first quarter of 2006 will increase in the range of 12 to 13 compared to the same quarter in 2005 this increase is primarily due to the following 

  

     

based upon the expectations and assumptions contained in this outlook section including the legal settlement with alstom of 016 per share we expect first quarter 2006 earnings per share to be in the range of 045 to 050 

  

year ended december 31 2005 compared to year ended december 31 2004 

  

revenues 

  

net revenues increased 88 in 2005 compared to 2004 due to a 74 increase in net yields and to a lesser extent a 14 increase in capacity the increase in net yields was primarily due to higher cruise ticket prices and amounts spent per passenger onboard higher cruise ticket prices were primarily attributable to a strong demand environment and a decrease in capacity growth within the industry the increase in capacity was primarily attributed to the addition of jewel of the seas in 2004 partially offset by enchantment of the seas  which was out of service for 53 days due to its lengthening in addition capacity in 2004 was negatively impacted by the cancellation of certain sailings primarily due to hurricanes and unscheduled drydocks occupancy in 2005 was 1066 compared to 1057 in 2004 gross yields increased 62 in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to the same reasons discussed above for net yields 

  

onboard and other revenues included concession revenues of 2230 million and 1963 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively the increase in concession revenues was primarily due to higher amounts spent per passenger onboard and the increase in capacity mentioned above 

  

expenses 

  

net cruise costs increased 78 in 2005 compared to 2004 due to a 63 increase in net cruise costs per apcd and the 14 increase in capacity mentioned above approximately 49 percentage points of the increase in net cruise costs per apcd was attributed to increases in fuel costs total fuel costs net of the financial impact of fuel swap agreements increased 460 in 2005 as compared to an increase of 275 in 2004 as a percentage of total revenues fuel costs were 75 and 55 in 2005 and 2004 respectively the remaining 14 percentage points of the increase in net cruise costs per apcd was primarily attributed to increases in payroll costs associated with benefits in addition net cruise costs in 2004 included approximately 113 million in costs related to the impact of hurricanes gross cruise costs increased 65 in 2005 compared to 2004 which was a lower percentage increase than net cruise costs primarily due to a lower proportion of passengers who purchased air transportation from us in 2005 

  

depreciation and amortization expenses increased 20 in 2005 compared to 2004 the increase was primarily due to incremental depreciation associated with the addition of jewel of the seas in 2004 as well as depreciation associated with other capital expenditures including the lengthening of enchantment of the seas in 2005 

  

other income expense 

  

in july 2005 first choice redeemed in full its 675 convertible preferred shares we received 3481 million in cash resulting in a net gain of 442 million primarily due to foreign exchange 

  

gross interest expense decreased to 2874 million in 2005 from 3172 million in 2004 the decrease was primarily attributable to lower average debt level partially offset by higher interest rates interest capitalized increased to 177 million in 2005 from 72 million in 2004 due to a higher average level of investment in ships under construction 

  

  

  

  

cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 

  

in the third quarter of 2005 we changed our method of accounting for drydocking costs from the accrual in advance to the deferral method see note 2  summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  the change resulted in a onetime gain of 525 million or 022 per share on a diluted basis to recognize the cumulative effect of the change on prior years which we reflected as part of our results in 2005 other than this onetime gain the change did not have a material impact on our consolidated statement of operations 

  

year ended december 31 2004 compared to year ended december 31 2003 

  

revenues 

  

net revenues increased 204 in 2004 compared to 2003 the increase was due to a 103 increase in capacity and a 92 increase in net yields the increase in capacity was primarily associated with the full year effect of the additions of serenade of the seas and mariner of the seas in 2003 and delivery of jewel of the seas in 2004 the increase in capacity was partially offset by the cancellation of 54 days of sailings in 2004 due to hurricanes and unscheduled drydocks the increase in net yields was primarily due to higher cruise ticket prices occupancy levels and amounts spent per passenger onboard these increases were primarily attributable to improved consumer sentiment towards leisure travel in 2003 we experienced lower cruise ticket prices due to consumer apprehension towards travel prior to and during the war in iraq and economic uncertainty occupancy in 2004 was 1057 compared to 1032 in 2003 gross yields increased 91 in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to the same reasons discussed above for net yields 

  

onboard and other revenues included concession revenues of 1963 million and 1630 million in 2004 and 2003 respectively which increased in 2004 primarily due to the same reasons discussed above for net revenues 

  

expenses 

  

net cruise costs increased 165 in 2004 compared to 2003 the increase was due to the 103 increase in capacity mentioned above and a 56 increase in net cruise costs per apcd the increase in net cruise costs per apcd was primarily attributed to increases in fuel prices marketing selling and administrative expenses crew salaries and medical expenses port expenses and costs associated with hurricanes the weightedaverage fuel price net of the financial impact of fuel swap agreements for the year ended december 31 2004 increased 14 per metric ton from the year ended december 31 2003 as a percentage of total revenues fuel costs were 55 and 52 for 2004 and 2003 respectively the increase in marketing selling and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increases in general and administrative costs associated with the expansion of our reservations and sales force and additional information technology projects in addition advertising costs increased primarily due to an increase in television media spending and the launch of the cirque du soleil and celebrity xpeditions marketing campaigns for celebrity cruises the increase in port expenses was primarily attributed to itinerary changes in 2004 we incurred approximately 113 million in costs related to the impact of hurricanes in contrast other operating expenses in 2003 were reduced by approximately 58 million in connection with a litigation settlement gross cruise costs per apcd increased 67 in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to the same reasons discussed above for net cruise costs per apcd 

  

depreciation and amortization expenses increased 87 in 2004 compared to 2003 the increase was primarily due to incremental depreciation associated with the full year effect of the addition of mariner of the seas and serenade of the seas in 2003 and jewel of the seas in 2004 

  

other income expense 

  

gross interest expense increased to 3172 million in 2004 from 2843 million in 2003 the increase was primarily attributable to a higher average debt level and higher interest rates interest capitalized during 2004 decreased to 72 million from 159 million in 2003 due to a lower average level of investment in ships under construction 

  

  

  

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

sources and uses of cash 

  

cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity net cash provided by operating activities was 11 billion in each of 2005 and 2004 and 09 billion in 2003 net cash provided by operating activities was positively impacted in 2005 by an increase in income before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle compared to 2004 this increase was primarily offset by a lower rate of increase in customer deposits in 2005 relative to 2004 the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily due to an increase in net income 

  

net cash used in investing activities decreased to 890 million in 2005 from 6325 million in 2004 and 11 billion in 2003 the decrease in 2005 was primarily due to the receipt of 3481 million in connection with the redemption of our investment in first choice convertible preferred shares in addition our capital expenditures were approximately 4299 million for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to approximately 6301 million in 2004 and 10 billion in 2003 capital expenditures were primarily related to ships under construction and the lengthening of enchantment of the seas in 2005 the deliveries of jewel of the seas in 2004 and serenade of the seas and mariner of the seas in 2003 as well as progress payments for ships under construction in all years 

  

net cash used in financing activities increased to 15 billion in 2005 compared to 01 billion in 2004 and net cash provided by financing activities was 03 billion in 2003 the increase in 2005 was primarily due to payments made on various debt instruments and an accelerated share repurchase “asr” transaction we made payments on various term loans senior notes revolving credit facilities and capital leases totaling approximately 9319 million 3614 million and 4711 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively in addition in 2005 we paid 3358 million in connection with the exercise of purchase options on our capital lease obligations for legend of the seas and splendour of the seas and we prepaid a total of 2970 million on secured and unsecured term loans we also purchased 55 million shares of our common stock in 2005 from an investment bank at an initial price of 4540 per share as part of an asr transaction total consideration paid to repurchase such shares including commissions and other fees was approximately 2491 million see note 6 shareholders’ equity to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  in 2005 we drew 2000 million on unsecured variable rate term loans due 2010 and 1900 million on our revolving credit facility in 2004 we drew 2250 million on an unsecured variable rate term loan due 2006 through 2012 in 2003 we received net cash proceeds of 5905 million from the issuance of senior unsecured notes due through 2013 see note 5 longterm debt to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  and we drew 2400 million on our revolving credit facility during 2005 2004 and 2003 we received 220 million 983 million and 460 million respectively in connection with the exercise of common stock options and we paid quarterly cash dividends on our common stock of 1188 million 1045 million and 983 million respectively these events contributed to improve our net debttocapital percentage to 420 in 2005 from 515 in 2004 and 564 in 2003 

  

future capital commitments 

  

our future capital commitments consist primarily of new ship orders as of december 31 2005 we had three freedomclass ships designated for royal caribbean international and one solsticeclass ship celebrity solstice  on order for an additional capacity of approximately 13800 berths the aggregate cost of the ships is approximately 32 billion of which we have deposited 3114 million as of december 31 2005 see note 10 financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

  

as of december 31 2005 we anticipated overall capital expenditures including the four ships on order will be approximately 11 billion for 2006 11 billion for 2007 16 billion for 2008 and 03 billion for 2009 

  

in february 2006 we exercised an option to purchase an additional solsticeclass ship for celebrity cruises celebrity equinox  for an additional capacity of approximately 2850 berths with scheduled delivery in the third quarter of 2009 also in february 2006 we entered into an agreement with a shipyard to build a new class of ship for royal caribbean international subject to certain conditions for an additional capacity of approximately 5400 berths with scheduled delivery in the third quarter of 2009 including these two additional ships our anticipated overall capital 

  

  

  

  

expenditures at december 31 2005 will increase to approximately 12 billion for 2006 13 billion for 2007 18 billion for 2008 and 19 billion in 2009 we have an option to purchase an additional ship for royal caribbean international exercisable through midmarch 2007 for an additional capacity of approximately 5400 berths if ordered the optional ship will be delivered in the third quarter of 2010 see note 13 subsequent events to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

  

contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

as of december 31 2005 our contractual obligations were as follows in thousands  

  

          

under the brilliance of the seas operating lease we have agreed to indemnify the lessor to the extent its aftertax return is negatively impacted by unfavorable changes in corporate tax rates and capital allowance deductions these indemnifications could result in an increase in our lease payments we are unable to estimate the maximum potential increase in such lease payments due to the various circumstances timing or combination of events that could trigger such indemnifications under current circumstances we do not believe an indemnification is probable 

  

some of the contracts that we enter into include indemnification provisions that obligate us to make payments to the counterparty if certain events occur these contingencies generally relate to changes in taxes increased lender capital costs and other similar costs the indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms and are entered into in the normal course of business there are no stated or notional amounts included in the indemnification clauses and we are not able to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments if any under these indemnification clauses we have not been required to make any payments under such indemnification clauses in the past and under current circumstances we do not believe an indemnification in any material amount is probable 

  

as a normal part of our business depending on market conditions pricing and our overall growth strategy we continuously consider opportunities to enter into contracts for the building of additional ships we may also consider the sale of ships we continuously consider potential acquisitions and strategic alliances if any of these were to occur they would be financed through the incurrence of additional indebtedness the issuance of additional shares of equity securities or through cash flows from operations 

  

  

  

  

funding sources 

  

as of december 31 2005 our liquidity was 10 billion consisting of approximately 01 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 09 billion available under our unsecured revolving credit facility see note 5 longterm debt to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  we have commitments of approximately 15 billion due during the twelvemonth period ending december 31 2006 these commitments will be funded through a combination of cash flows from operations drawdowns under our available unsecured revolving credit facility the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the sales of equity or debt securities in private or public securities markets although we believe our existing unsecured revolving credit facility cash flows from operations our ability to obtain new borrowings andor raise new capital or a combination of these sources will be sufficient to fund operations debt payment requirements capital expenditures and other commitments over the next twelvemonth period there can be no assurances that these sources of cash will be available in accordance with our expectations 

  

our financing agreements contain covenants that require us among other things to maintain minimum net worth and fixed charge coverage ratio and limit our debt to capital ratio we were in compliance with all covenants as of december 31 2005 

  

if any person other than a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates our two principal shareholders acquires ownership of more than 30 of our common stock and our two principal shareholders in the aggregate own less of our common stock than such person and do not collectively have the right to elect or to designate for election at least a majority of the board of directors we may be obligated to prepay indebtedness outstanding under the majority of our credit facilities which we may be unable to replace on similar terms if this were to occur it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity and operations 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

financial instruments and other 

  

general 

  

we are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices we minimize these risks through a combination of our normal operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments pursuant to our hedging practices and policies the financial impacts of these hedging instruments are primarily offset by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures being hedged we achieve this by closely matching the amount term and conditions of the derivative instrument with the underlying risk being hedged we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes we monitor our derivative positions using techniques including market valuations and sensitivity analyses see note 10 financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

  

interest rate risk 

  

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our longterm debt obligations and our operating lease for brilliance of the seas  at december 31 2005 66 of our longterm debt was effectively fixed and 34 was floating we enter into interest rate swap agreements to modify our exposure to interest rate movements and to manage our interest expense and rent expense 

  

market risk associated with our longterm fixed rate debt is the potential increase in fair value resulting from a decrease in interest rates at december 31 2005 our interest rate swap agreements effectively changed 2688 million of fixed rate debt with a weightedaverage fixed rate of 78 to liborbased floating rate debt the estimated fair value of our longterm fixed rate debt at december 31 2005 excluding our liquid yield option ™ notes and zero coupon convertible notes was 24 billion using quoted market prices where available or using discounted cash flow analyses based on market rates available to us for similar debt with the same remaining maturities the fair value of our associated interest rate swap agreements was estimated to be 105 million as of december 31 2005 based on quoted market prices for similar or identical financial instruments to those we hold a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates at december 31 2005 would increase the fair value of our longterm fixed rate debt excluding our liquid yield 

  

  

  

  

option ™ notes and zero coupon convertible notes by approximately 1107 million net of an increase in the fair value of the associated interest rate swap agreements 

  

market risk associated with our longterm floating rate debt is the potential increase in interest expense from an increase in interest rates a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase our 2006 interest expense by approximately 76 million at december 31 2005 we have an interest rate swap agreement that effectively changes 25 million of liborbased floating rate debt to fixed rate debt of 4395 

  

market risk associated with our operating lease for brilliance of the seas is the potential increase in rent expense from an increase in sterling libor rates as of january 2006 we have effectively changed 69 of the operating lease obligation from a floating rate to a fixed rate obligation with a weightedaverage rate of 483 through a combination of interest rate swap agreements and rate fixings with the lessor a hypothetical one percentage point increase in sterling libor rates would increase our 2006 rent expense by approximately 13 million based on the exchange rate at december 31 2005 net of the effect of interest rate swaps 

  

convertible notes 

  

the estimated fair values of our liquid yield option ™ notes and zero coupon convertible notes fluctuate with the price of our common stock and at december 31 2005 were 5951 million and 2008 million respectively a hypothetical 10 decrease or increase in our december 31 2005 common stock price would decrease or increase the value of our liquid yield option ™ notes and zero coupon convertible notes by approximately 488 million and 200 million respectively 

  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

  

our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to our firm commitments under ship construction contracts denominated in euros we entered into euro denominated forward contracts to manage this risk the estimated fair value of such euro denominated forward contracts at december 31 2005 was a net unrealized loss of approximately 1111 million based on quoted market prices for equivalent instruments with the same remaining maturities these euro denominated forward contracts mature through 2008 at december 31 2005 approximately 6 of the cost of the ship construction contracts was exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate a hypothetical 10 strengthening of the euro as of december 31 2005 assuming no changes in comparative interest rates would result in a 2404 million increase in the united states dollar cost of the foreign currency denominated ship construction contracts this increase would be largely offset by an increase in the fair value of our euro denominated forward contracts 

  

we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the united states dollar value of our foreign currency denominated forecasted transactions to manage this exposure we take advantage of any natural offsets of our foreign currency revenues and expenses and enter into foreign currency forward contracts for a portion of the remaining exposure related to these forecasted transactions our principal net foreign currency exposure relates to the euro the norwegian kroner and the canadian dollar at december 31 2005 the estimated fair value of such contracts was an unrealized loss of approximately 43 million based on quoted market prices for equivalent instruments with the same remaining maturities a hypothetical 10 strengthening of the principal foreign currencies as of december 31 2005 assuming no changes in comparative interest rates would result in a 16 million increase in the united states dollar value of the 2006 foreign currency denominated forecasted transactions this increase would be offset by a decrease in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts of approximately 15 million 

  

fuel price risk 

  

our exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates to the consumption of fuel on our ships fuel cost net of the financial impact of fuel swap agreements as a percentage of our total revenues was approximately 75 in 2005 55 in 2004 and 52 in 2003 historically we have used fuel swap agreements and zero cost collars to mitigate the financial impact of fluctuations in fuel prices as of december 31 2005 we had fuel swap agreements to pay fixed prices for fuel with an aggregate notional amount of approximately 924 million maturing through 2007 the estimated fair value of these contracts at december 31 2005 was an unrealized loss of 01 million we estimate that a hypothetical 10 increase in our weightedaverage fuel price from that experienced during the year ended december 31 2005 would increase our 2006 fuel cost by approximately 

  

  

  

  

403 million this increase would be partially offset by an increase in the fair value of our fuel swap agreements of approximately 92 million

• weather 

 

the above examples are not exhaustive and new risks emerge from time to time we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states see note 1 general and note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements certain of our accounting policies are deemed “critical” as they require management’s highest degree of judgment estimates and assumptions we have discussed these accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors we believe our most critical accounting policies are as follows 

 

 

ship accounting 

 

our ships represent our most significant assets and are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization depreciation of ships which includes amortization of ships under capital leases is computed net of a 15 projected residual value using the straightline method over estimated service lives of primarily 30 years improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized as additions to the ship and depreciated over the improvements’ estimated useful lives the estimated cost and accumulated depreciation of refurbished or replaced ship components are writtenoff and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in cruise operating expenses repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred and drydocking costs are accrued evenly over the period to the next scheduled drydocking 

 

our service life and residual value estimates take into consideration the impact of anticipated technological changes longterm cruise and vacation market conditions and historical useful lives of similarlybuilt ships in addition we take into consideration our estimates of the average useful lives of the ships’ major component systems such as hull superstructure main electric engines and cabins given the very large and complex nature of our ships our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain we do not have cost segregation studies performed to specifically componentize our ship systems therefore we estimate the costs of component systems based principally on general and technical information known about major ship component systems and their lives and our knowledge of the cruise vacation industry we do not identify and track depreciation by ship component systems but instead utilize these estimates to determine the net cost basis of assets replaced or refurbished 

 

we believe we have made reasonable estimates for ship accounting purposes however should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimates of ship service lives or projected residual values depreciation expense could be materially higher or lower if circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making determinations as to whether ship improvements should be capitalized the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance costs could increase partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense if we had reduced our estimated average 30year ship service life by one year depreciation expense for 2004 would have increased by approximately 13 million further if our ships were estimated to have no residual value depreciation expense for 2004 would have increased by approximately 70 million 

 

valuation of longlived assets and goodwill 

 

we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash flows if these estimated future cash flows were less than the carrying value of the asset an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference between the asset’s estimated fair value and its carrying value 

 

the determination of fair value is based on quoted market prices in active markets if available such markets are often not available for used cruise ships accordingly we also base fair value on independent appraisals sales price negotiations and projected future cash flows discounted at a rate determined by management to be commensurate with our business risk the estimation of fair value utilizing discounted forecasted cash flows includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of revenues operating costs marketing selling and administrative expenses interest rates ship additions and retirements cruise vacation industry competition and general economic and business conditions among other factors 

 

goodwill is reviewed annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be fully recoverable the impairment review consists of comparing the fair value of goodwill to the carrying value if the carrying value exceeds the fair value an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value we use the market capitalization method in determining the fair value of our goodwill if under certain circumstances this method is not representative of fair value we use a present value of future cash flows approach 

 

 

we believe we have made reasonable estimates and judgments in determining whether our longlived assets and goodwill have been impaired however if there is a material change in the assumptions used in our determination of fair values or if there is a material change in the conditions or circumstances influencing fair value we could be required to recognize a material impairment charge 

 

contingencies — litigation 

 

on an ongoing basis we assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss if any can be made in assessing probable losses we take into consideration estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries if any we accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recoveries it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made 

 

terminology 

 

available passenger cruise days “apcd” are our measurement of capacity and represent double occupancy per cabin multiplied by the number of cruise days for the period 

 

gross cruise costs represent the sum of total cruise operating expenses plus marketing selling and administrative expenses 

 

gross yields represent total revenues per apcd 

 

net cruise costs represent gross cruise costs excluding commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses each of which is described below under the summary of historical results of operations heading in measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income we believe changes in net cruise costs to be the most relevant indicator of our performance we have not provided a quantitative reconciliation of projected gross cruise costs to projected net cruise costs due to the significant uncertainty in projecting the costs deducted to arrive at this measure accordingly we do not believe that reconciling information for such projected figures would be meaningful 

 

net yields represent gross yields less commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses each of which is described below under the summary of historical results of operations heading per apcd we utilize net yields to manage our business on a daytoday basis and believe that it is the most relevant measure of our pricing performance we have not provided a quantitative reconciliation of projected gross yields to projected net yields due to the significant uncertainty in projecting the costs deducted to arrive at this measure accordingly we do not believe that reconciling information for such projected figures would be meaningful 

 

occupancy percentage in accordance with cruise vacation industry practice is calculated by dividing passenger cruise days by apcd a percentage in excess of 100 indicates that three or more passengers occupied some cabins 

 

passenger cruise days represent the number of passengers carried for the period multiplied by the number of days of their respective cruises 

 

 

 

overview 

 

our revenues consist of the following 

 

passenger ticket revenues consist of revenue recognized from the sale of passenger tickets and the sale of air transportation to our ships 

 

onboard and other revenues consist primarily of revenues from the sale of goods andor services onboard our ships cancellation fees sales of vacation protection insurance and pre and post tours also included are revenues we receive from independent third party concessionaires that pay us a percentage of their revenues in exchange for the right to provide selected goods andor services onboard our ships 

 

our cruise operating expenses consist of the following 

 

commissions transportation and other expenses consist of those costs directly associated with passenger ticket revenues including travel agent commissions air and other transportation expenses port costs that vary with passenger head counts and related credit card fees 

 

onboard and other expenses consist of the direct costs associated with onboard and other revenues these costs include the cost of products sold onboard our ships vacation protection insurance premiums costs associated with pre and post tours and related credit card fees concession revenues have minimal costs associated with them as the costs related to these activities are incurred by the concessionaires 

 

payroll and related expenses consist of costs for shipboard personnel 

 

food expenses include food costs for both passengers and crew 

 

other operating expenses consist of operating costs such as fuel repairs and maintenance port costs that do not vary with passenger head counts insurance entertainment and all other operating costs 

 

we do not allocate payroll and related costs food costs or other operating costs to the expense categories attributable to passenger ticket revenues or onboard and other revenues since they are incurred to provide the total cruise vacation experience

tablestart our financing agreements contain covenants that require us among other things to maintain minimum net worth and fixed charge coverage ratio and limit our debt to capital ratio we were in compliance with all covenants as of december 31 2004 

 

if a wilhelmsen as and cruise associates our two principal shareholders cease to own a specified percentage of our common stock we may be obligated to prepay indebtedness outstanding under the majority of our credit facilities which we may be unable to replace on similar terms if this were to occur it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity and operations 

 

we believe our existing credit facility cash flows from operations our ability to obtain new borrowings andor raise new capital or a combination of these sources will be sufficient to fund operations debt payment requirements and capital expenditures over the next twelvemonth period 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

financial instruments and other 

 

general 

 

we are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices we minimize these risks through a combination of our normal operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments pursuant to our hedging practices and policies the financial impacts of these hedging instruments are primarily offset by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures being hedged we achieve this by closely matching the amount term and conditions of the derivative instrument with the underlying risk being hedged we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes we monitor our derivative positions using techniques including market valuations and sensitivity analyses see note 11 financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements 

 

interest rate risk 

 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our longterm debt obligations and our operating lease for brilliance of the seas  at december 31 2004 64 of our debt was effectively fixed and 36 was floating we enter into interest rate swap agreements to modify our exposure to interest rate movements and to manage our interest expense and rent expense 

 

market risk associated with our longterm fixed rate debt is the potential increase in fair value resulting from a decrease in interest rates at december 31 2004 our interest rate swap agreements effectively changed 2688 million of fixed rate debt with a weightedaverage fixed rate of 781 to liborbased floating rate debt the estimated fair value of our longterm fixed rate debt at december 31 2004 excluding our liquid yield option ™ notes and zero coupon convertible notes was 31 billion using quoted market prices where available or using discounted cash flow analyses based on market rates available to us for similar debt with the same remaining maturities the fair value of our associated interest rate swap agreements was estimated to be 219 million as of december 31 2004 based on quoted market prices for similar or identical financial instruments to those we hold a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates at december 31 2004 would increase the fair value of our longterm fixed rate debt excluding our liquid yield option ™ notes and zero coupon convertible notes by approximately 1441 million net of an increase in the fair value of the associated interest rate swap agreements 

 

market risk associated with our longterm floating rate debt is the potential increase in interest expense from an increase in interest rates a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase our 2005 interest expense by approximately 94 million at december 31 2004 we have an interest rate swap agreement that effectively changes 25 million of liborbased floating rate debt to fixed rate debt of 4395 beginning january 2005 

 

market risk associated with our operating lease for brilliance of the seas is the potential increase in rent expense from an increase in sterling libor rates as of january 2005 we have effectively changed 58 of the operating lease obligation from a floating rate to a fixed rate obligation with a weightedaverage rate of 481 through a combination of interest rate swap agreements and rate fixings with the lessor a hypothetical one percentage point increase in sterling libor rates would increase our 2005 rent expense by approximately 20 million based on the exchange rate at december 31 2004 net of the effect of interest rate swaps 

 

convertible notes 

 

the estimated fair values of our liquid yield option ™ notes and zero coupon convertible notes fluctuate with the price of our common stock and at december 31 2004 were 9628 million and 7568 million respectively a hypothetical 10 decrease or increase in our december 31 2004 common stock price would decrease or increase the value of our liquid yield option ™ notes and zero coupon convertible notes by approximately 961 million and 743 million respectively 

 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

 

our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to our firm commitments under ship construction contracts including a ship lengthening contract denominated in euros we entered into euro denominated forward contracts to manage this risk the estimated fair value of such euro denominated forward contracts at december 31 2004 was a net unrealized gain of approximately 1109 million based on quoted market prices for equivalent instruments with the same remaining maturities these euro denominated forward contracts mature through 2007 at december 31 2004 approximately 26 of the cost of the ship construction contracts was exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate a hypothetical 10 strengthening of the euro as of december 31 2004 assuming no changes in comparative interest rates would result in a 1406 million increase in the united states dollar value of the foreign currency denominated ship construction contracts this increase would be partially offset by an increase in the fair value of our euro denominated forward contracts of approximately 1043 million 

 

we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the united states dollar value of our foreign currency denominated forecasted transactions to manage this exposure we take advantage of any natural offsets of our foreign currency revenues and expenses and enter into foreign currency forward contracts andor option contracts for a portion of the remaining exposure related to these forecasted transactions our principal net foreign currency exposure relates to the euro the norwegian kroner british pound sterling and the canadian dollar at december 31 2004 the estimated fair value of such contracts was an unrealized loss of approximately 60 million based on quoted market prices for equivalent instruments with the same remaining maturities a hypothetical 10 strengthening of the principal foreign currencies as of december 31 2004 assuming no changes in comparative interest rates would result in a 58 million increase in the united states dollar value of the 2005 foreign currency denominated forecasted transactions this increase would be offset by a decrease in the fair value of our 2005 foreign currency forward contracts of approximately 64 million 

 

fuel price risk 

 

our exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates to the consumption of fuel on our ships fuel cost as a percentage of our total revenues was approximately 55 in 2004 52 in 2003 and 45 in 2002 historically we have used fuel swap agreements and zero cost collars to mitigate the financial impact of fluctuations in fuel prices as of december 31 2004 we had fuel swap agreements to pay fixed prices for fuel with an aggregate notional amount of approximately 354 million maturing through 2005 the estimated fair value of these contracts at december 31 2004 was an unrealized gain of 81 million we estimate that a hypothetical 10 increase in our weightedaverage fuel price from that experienced during the year ended december 31 2004 would increase our 2005 fuel cost by approximately 282 million this increase would be partially offset by an increase in the fair value of our fuel swap agreements of approximately 39 million
