manufacturing raw materials and other resources 

our production operations include machining molding and assembly we manufacture specially designed parts and assemble components into finished equipment many components are made in standard modules that can be used in more than one product or in combination with other components for a variety of models we have principal manufacturing operations and sources of supply in the united states in ohio georgia california colorado connecticut illinois massachusetts michigan minnesota new jersey rhode island tennessee and wisconsin as well as in the people’s republic of china germany ireland israel mexico the netherlands and the united kingdom 

principal materials used to make our products are metals and plastics typically in sheets bar stock castings forgings tubing and pellets we also purchase many electrical and electronic components fabricated metal parts highpressure fluid hoses packings seals and other items integral to our products suppliers are competitively selected based on cost quality and service most significant raw materials that we use are available through multiple sources we purchase most raw materials and other components on the open market and rely on third parties to provide certain finished goods while these items are generally available from multiple sources the cost of products sold may be affected by changes in the market price of raw materials and tariffs on certain raw materials particularly imports from china as well as disruptions in availability of raw materials components and sourced finished goods 

we monitor and investigate alternative suppliers and materials based on numerous attributes including quality service financial stability and price we currently source raw materials and components from a number of suppliers but our ongoing efforts to improve the cost effectiveness of our products and services may result in a reduction in the number of our suppliers 

nordson corporation 6 

senior operating management supervises an extensive quality control program for our equipment machinery and systems and manufacturing processes 

natural gas and other fuels are our primary energy sources however standby capacity for alternative sources is available if needed 

though the covid19 pandemic disrupted the global supply chain we have not experienced significant supply disruption from thirdparty component suppliers however we have faced and continue to face some supply chain constraints primarily related to electronic component availability while logistics flow continues to improve we are experiencing much higher costs than prepandemic rates due to carrier rate increases mode changes fuel costs port backlog and other factors in addition shipments between countries have been impacted and we have experienced delays due to a variety of factors related to supply chain disruption 

intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights including patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property our worldwide intellectual property portfolio is strengthened through innovation and brand recognition and our comprehensive approach for protection and enforcement we enter into confidentiality and intellectual property agreements with our employees that require them to disclose any inventions created in the scope of employment convey all rights to those inventions to us and restrict the distribution of proprietary information risk factors associated with our intellectual property are discussed in item 1a risk factors 

we protect and promote our intellectual property portfolio and take those actions we deem appropriate to enforce our intellectual property rights and to defend our rights to sell our products both domestically and internationally although in the aggregate our global portfolio of more than 2100 granted and pending patents and more than 1000 trademarks are valuable assets that are important to our operations we believe that our competitive advantage is also largely attributable to the technical marketing and sales competence and capabilities of our employees rather than on any individual patent or trademark therefore we do not consider the expiration or loss of any single patent trademark or intellectual property right to be material to our business as a whole 

seasonal variation in business 

historically the highest volume of sales occurs in the second half of the fiscal year due in large part to the timing of customers’ capital spending programs accordingly fiscal first quarter sales volume is typically the lowest of the year due to timing of customers’ capital spending programs and customer holiday shutdowns however the covid19 pandemic supply chain disruptions historic backlog and other unusual events have impacted this historical trend to a degree 

competitive conditions 

we operate in a competitive global marketplace and compete with many large wellestablished and highly competitive manufacturers and service providers our business is affected by a range of macroeconomic conditions including industry capacity changes global competition and economic conditions in the us and abroad as well as fluctuations in currency exchange rates our equipment is sold in competition with a wide variety of alternative bonding sealing finishing coating processing testing inspecting and fluid control techniques potential uses for our equipment include any production processes that require preparation modification or curing of surfaces dispensing application processing or control of fluids and materials or testing and inspecting for quality 

many factors influence our competitive position including pricing product quality and service we maintain a leadership position in our business segments by delivering highquality innovative products and technologies as well as global service and technical support working with customers to understand their processes and developing the application solutions that help them meet their production requirements also contributes to our leadership position our worldwide network of direct sales and technical resources also is a competitive advantage 

compliance with governmental regulations 

as a us public company that supports manufacturing designing and servicing highly complex products in regulated environments our global operations are subject to a variety of laws regulations and compliance obligations we have robust internal controls quality management systems and management systems of compliance that govern our internal actions and mitigate our risk of noncompliance we also have safeguards established to identify noncompliance concerns through internal and external audits and risk assessments as well as an ethics helpline reporting system 

we are also required to comply with increasingly complex and changing laws and regulations enacted to protect business and personal data in the united states and other jurisdictions regarding privacy data protection and data security including those 

nordson corporation 7 

related to the collection storage use transmission and protection of personal information and other consumer customer vendor or employee data such privacy and data protection laws and regulations including with respect to the european union’s general data protection regulation gdpr the brazilian general data protection law and the california consumer privacy act of 2018 ccpa and the interpretation and enforcement of such laws and regulations are continuously developing and evolving and there is significant uncertainty with respect to how compliance with these laws and regulations may evolve and the costs and complexity of future compliance 

we are also subject to federal state local and foreign environmental safety and health laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to land and water and the generation handling treatment and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials under certain of these laws we can be held strictly liable for hazardous substance contamination of any real property we have ever owned operated or used as a disposal site or for natural resource damages associated with such contamination we are also required to maintain various related permits and licenses many of which require periodic modification and renewal the operation of manufacturing plants unavoidably entails environmental safety and health risks and we could incur material unanticipated costs or liabilities in the future if any of these risks were realized in ways or to an extent that we did not anticipate 

we believe that we operate in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations compliance with environmental laws and regulations requires continuing management effort and expenditures we have incurred and will continue to incur costs and capital expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations and to obtain and maintain the necessary permits and licenses we believe that the cost of complying with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our earnings liquidity or competitive position but cannot assure that material compliancerelated costs and expenses may not arise in the future for example future adoption of new or amended environmental laws regulations or requirements or newly discovered contamination or other circumstances could require us to incur costs and expenses that may have a material effect but cannot be presently anticipated 

we believe that policies practices and procedures have been properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of material environmental damage arising from our operations we accrue for estimated environmental liabilities with charges to expense and believe our environmental accrual is adequate to provide for our portion of the costs of all such known environmental liabilities compliance with federal state local and foreign environmental protection laws during 2022 had no material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position based upon consideration of currently available information we believe liabilities for environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position operating results or liquidity but we cannot ensure that material environmental liabilities may not arise in the future

employee profile 

as of october 31 2022 we had 7331 fulltime and parttime employees including 128 at our amherst ohio facility who are represented by a collective bargaining agreement that expires on november 16 2025 

total rewards 

as part of our compensation philosophy we believe that we must offer and maintain market competitive total rewards programs for our employees in order to attract and retain superior talent these programs not only include base wages and incentives in support of our pay for performance culture but also health welfare and retirement benefits we focus many programs on employee wellness and have implemented solutions including mental health support access telemedicine and healthy weight loss programs we believe that these solutions have helped us successfully manage healthcare and prescription drug costs for our employee population 

in the us we match contributions to a taxqualified defined contribution retirement savings plan the “savings plan” for all eligible employees in an amount equal to 50 cents for every dollar contributed by the employee until the employee contributions reach 6 of her or his base compensation in addition nonunion new hires and rehires as of july 1 2021 are eligible for an additional enhanced 401k contribution of 3 eligible earnings all contributions by employees into the savings plan are fully vested immediately company contributions both the match and enhanced contribution have a threeyear graded vesting schedule and vest at 33 13 each year until fully vested after three years of employment we also maintain a nonqualified unfunded and unsecured deferred compensation plan for the benefit of eligible management employees whose benefits under the savings plan are limited by the benefit restrictions of section 415 of the internal revenue code in addition nonunion employees hired prior to july 1 2021 are eligible to participate in a companysponsored taxqualified pension plan for usbased employees the “salaried pension plan” the salaried pension plan is designed to work together with social security benefits to provide employees with up to 30 years of service retirement income replacement that is approximately 55 of eligible compensation subject to the internal revenue code maximum monthly benefit participants fully vest in the salaried 

nordson corporation 8 

pension plan after five years of service all eligible union employees hired prior to november 1 2004 participate in a companysponsored taxqualified pension plan for usbased employees the “hourly pension plan” the hourly pension plan provides a multiplier for each year of service to supplement employees’ retirement income we also maintain a supplemental retirement benefit restoration plan “excess defined benefit pension plan” which is an unfunded nonqualified plan that is designed to provide retirement benefits to usbased eligible participants hired prior to july 1 2021 as a replacement for retirement benefits limited by regulations under the internal revenue code 

in 2022 we launched a global recognition program that allows managers and peers to recognize the special achievements of others through both written recognition shared on a company awards feed as well as monetary recognition that allows a recipient to choose a physical gift gift card or donate the value of their recognition to charity we also continue our service award program which demonstrates appreciation and thanks to longstanding employees with five or more years of service service milestones are recognized at each fiveyear increment by presentation of a digital andor printed certificate with an invitation to select a recognition award via an online catalog 

talent 

our key talent philosophy is to develop talent from within and supplement with external hires this approach has yielded a deep understanding among our employee base of our business products and customers while adding new employees and ideas in support of our continuous improvement mindset attracting and retaining the best talent relies on our ability to provide a diverse and inclusive workplace personal and professional growth opportunities and a rewarding employee experience we strive to uphold a culture of shared knowledge appreciation and success we believe that our average tenure across the globe reflects our positive workplace culture and the strong engagement of our employees our talent acquisition team uses internal and external resources to recruit highly skilled and talented workers and we encourage employee referrals for open positions 

talent development and succession planning for critical roles is a cornerstone of our talent program development plans are created and monitored to ensure progress is made along the established timelines development plans also intersect with our mission particularly as we strive to be responsible to our communities 

one of our core values—respect for people—reflects the behavior we strive to include in every aspect of the way we conduct business our approach encompasses inclusion awareness and skillbuilding intentionality with respect to diversity in our hiring and selection process and performance management and succession planning that recognizes the importance of diversity we strive to promote inclusion through ongoing “inclusive leadership” and unconscious bias training across the company we regularly reflect on our progress and explore opportunities to improve our inclusion and diversity programs including at the executive leadership and board levels

 item 1a risk factors 

in an enterprise as diverse as ours a wide range of factors could affect future performance we discuss in this section some of the risk factors that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition value and results of operations you should consider these risk factors in connection with evaluating the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report because these factors could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected in forwardlooking statements you should not interpret the disclosure of any risk factor to imply that the risk factor has not already materialized additional risks factors may exist that are not presently known by the company or that are currently deemed immaterial may also be present 

risks related to economic conditions 

the covid19 pandemic has negatively disrupted and may continue to negatively disrupt our business and results of operations 

throughout the covid19 pandemic we have supported and continue to support multiple “critical infrastructure” sectors by manufacturing materials and products needed for medical supply chains packaging transportation energy communications and other critical infrastructure industries we have continued to operate during the covid19 pandemic in all our production 

nordson corporation 9 

facilities having taken the recommended public health measures to ensure worker and workplace safety as a result there have been unfavorable impacts on our manufacturing efficiencies 

we continue to actively monitor the evolving circumstances and impact of the covid19 pandemic which has negatively disrupted and may continue to negatively disrupt our business and results of operations in the future for example in the second quarter of 2022 our revenue growth in asiapacific was negatively impacted by covid19 lockdowns in china covid19 lockdown restrictions in china continue to be implemented from time to time the full extent of the covid19 pandemic on our operations and the markets we serve remains highly uncertain and will depend largely on future developments related to the covid19 pandemic including infection rates increasing or returning in various geographic areas variations of covid19 the ultimate duration of the covid19 pandemic actions by government authorities to contain the outbreak or treat its impact such as reimposing previously lifted measures or putting in place additional restrictions and the widespread distribution and acceptance of an effective vaccine among other things these developments are constantly evolving and cannot be accurately predicted 

changes in united states or international economic conditions including declines in the industries we serve could adversely affect the profitability of any of our operations 

in 2022 approximately 33 percent of our revenue was generated in the united states while approximately 67 percent was generated outside the united states the covid19 pandemic and related preventative and mitigation measures implemented by governments around the world and the conflict between russia and ukraine have to date negatively impacted the global economy and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets 

a general sustained slowdown in the global economy or in a particular region or industry or an increase in trade tensions with us trading partners could negatively impact our business financial condition or liquidity our largest markets include consumer nondurable industrial medical electronics consumer durable and automotive a slowdown in any of these specific end markets could directly affect our revenue stream and profitability 

a portion of our product sales is attributable to industries and markets such as the electronics polymer processing and metal finishing industries which historically have been cyclical and sensitive to relative changes in supply and demand and general economic conditions the demand for our products depends in part on the general economic conditions of the industries or national economies of our customers downward economic cycles in our customers’ industries or countries may reduce sales of some of our products it is not possible to predict accurately the factors that will affect demand for our products in the future 

any significant downturn in the health of the general economy or any recession depression or other sustained adverse market event including inflationary pressures could have an adverse effect on our revenues and financial performance resulting in impairment of assets we cannot predict the strength or duration of any economic slowdown and instability or the timing of any recovery 

our results have been and could continue to be impacted by uncertainty in us trade policy including uncertainty surrounding changes in tariffs trade agreements or other trade restrictions imposed by the us or other governments 

our ability to conduct business can be significantly impacted by changes in tariffs changes or repeals of trade agreements including the impact of the “united statesmexicocanada agreement” with mexico and canada which replaced the north american free trade agreement or the imposition of other trade restrictions or retaliatory actions imposed by various governments other effects of these changes including impacts on the price of raw materials responsive actions from governments and the opportunity for competitors to establish a presence in markets where we participate could also have significant impacts on our results we cannot predict what further action may be taken with respect to tariffs or trade relations between the us and other governments and any further changes in us or international trade policy could have an adverse impact on our business further the level of impact from the covid19 pandemic and the reactions of governmental authorities and others thereto as well as the conflict between russia and ukraine may have significant adverse effects on international trade policy 

significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates or change in monetary policy may harm our financial results 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly with respect to the euro the yen the pound sterling and the chinese yuan any significant change in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business against the united states dollar could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for additional detail related to this risk see part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

a significant portion of our consolidated revenues in 2022 were generated in currencies other than the united states dollar which is our reporting currency we recognize foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from our operations in the period incurred as a result currency fluctuations between the united states dollar and the currencies in which we do business 

nordson corporation 10 

have caused and may continue to cause foreign currency transaction and translation movements which historically have been material and could continue to be material we cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future operating results because of the number of currencies involved the variability of currency exposures and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates we take actions to manage our foreign currency exposure such as entering into hedging transactions where applicable but we cannot assure that our strategies will adequately protect our consolidated operating results from the effects of exchange rate fluctuations for example uncertainty surrounding the impact of the covid19 pandemic the impact of the conflict between russia and ukraine changes in monetary policies and the effects of the departure of the united kingdom from the european union brexit have caused increased volatility in global currency exchange rates that have resulted in the strengthening of the united states dollar against the foreign currencies in which we conduct business future adverse consequences arising from the covid19 pandemic the conflict between russia and ukraine and brexit may include continued volatility in exchange rates any significant fluctuation in exchange rates may be harmful to our financial condition and results of operations we also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into united states dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or customers located in or conducting business in a country imposing controls currency devaluations diminish the united states dollar value of the currency of the country instituting the devaluation and if they occur or continue for significant periods could adversely affect our earnings or cash flow 

risks related to our business and operations 

a disruption in shortage of or price increases for supply of our components and raw materials may adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

while we manufacture certain parts and components used in our products we require substantial amounts of raw materials and purchase some parts and components from suppliers the availability and prices for raw materials parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to among other things suppliers allocation to other purchasers interruptions in production by suppliers and changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels including as a result of inflation the covid19 pandemic and the conflict between russia and ukraine have negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact the availability and prices for raw materials parts and components while we generally attempt to pass along higher raw material part and component costs to our customers in the form of price increases there historically has been a delay between an increase in our raw material costs and our ability to increase the prices of our products additionally we may not be able to increase the prices of our products due to competitive pricing pressure and other factors shortages in raw materials or our inability to pass along price increases could affect the prices we charge our operating costs and our competitive position which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition our facilities supply chains distribution systems and products may be impacted by natural or manmade disruptions including armed conflict demand surges damaging weather or other acts of nature including weather or other acts of nature caused by climate change pandemics or other public health crises a shutdown of or inability to utilize one or more of our facilities our supply chain or our distribution system could significantly disrupt our operations delay production and shipments impact our relationships and reputation with customers suppliers employees and others result in lost or decreased sales or result in legal exposure and large remediation or other expenses which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

failure to retain our existing senior management team or the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could hurt our business and inhibit our ability to operate and grow successfully 

the covid19 pandemic has created labor force disruptions impacting factory production and other operations our success will continue to depend to a significant extent on the continued service of our executive management team and the ability to recruit hire and retain other key management personnel including factory production workers and other staff to support our growth and operational initiatives and replace those who retire or resign failure to retain our leadership team and workforce and to attract and retain other important management and technical personnel could place a constraint on our global growth and operational initiatives possibly resulting in inefficient and ineffective management and operations which would likely harm our revenues operations and product development efforts and eventually result in a decrease in profitability 

the company may be subject to risks relating to organizational changes 

we regularly execute organizational changes such as acquisitions divestitures and realignments to support our growth and cost management strategies we also engage in initiatives aimed to increase productivity efficiencies and cash flow and to reduce costs the company commits significant resources to identify develop and retain key employees to ensure uninterrupted leadership and direction if we are unable to successfully manage these and other organizational changes the ability to complete such activities and realize anticipated synergies or cost savings as well as our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected we cannot offer assurances that any of these initiatives will be beneficial to the extent 

nordson corporation 11 

anticipated or that the estimated efficiency improvements incremental cost savings or cash flow improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all 

political conditions in and between the united states and foreign countries in which we operate could adversely affect us 

we conduct our manufacturing sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and are subject to risks associated with doing business both within and outside the united states we expect that international operations and united states export sales will continue to be important to our business for the foreseeable future both sales from international operations and export sales are subject to varying degrees of risks inherent in doing business outside the united states such risks include but are not limited to the following 

• risks of political or economic instability 

• unanticipated or unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations 

• threats of war terrorism or governmental instability including the conflict between russia and ukraine 

• changes in tax rates adoption of new tax laws or other additional tax policies and other proposals to reform united states and foreign tax laws that impact how united states multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings 

• restrictions on the transfer of funds into or out of a country 

• potential negative consequences from changes to taxation policies 

• the disruption of operations from labor and political disturbances 

• the imposition of tariffs import or export licensing requirements and other potential changes in trade policies and relations arising from policy initiatives implemented by the us presidential administration 

• exchange controls or other trade restrictions including transfer pricing restrictions when products produced in one country are sold to an affiliated entity in another country and 

• government responses to the covid19 pandemic 

any of these events could reduce the demand for our products limit the prices at which we can sell our products interrupt our supply chain or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operating performance 

our international operations also depend upon favorable trade relations between the us and those foreign countries in which our customers subcontractors and materials suppliers have operations a protectionist trade environment in either the us or those foreign countries in which we do business such as a change in the current tariff structures export compliance or other trade policies may materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our products in foreign markets the current us presidential administration has criticized existing trade agreements and while it remains unclear what actions the current or future administration may take with respect to existing and proposed trade agreements or restrictions on trade generally more stringent export and import controls may be ultimately imposed in the future 

increased information technology threats and more sophisticated and targeted cybercrime could pose a risk to our systems networks products solutions and services 

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience cyberattacks to our systems and networks to date we have not experienced any material breaches or material losses related to cyberattacks to conduct our business we rely extensively on information technology systems networks and services some of which are managed hosted and provided by thirdparty service providers increased global information technology security threats more sophisticated and targeted computer crime and cyberterrorism pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and those of our thirdparty service providers and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data depending on their nature and scope such threats could potentially lead to the compromising of confidential information including but not limited to confidential information relating to customer or employee data improper use of our systems and networks manipulation and destruction of data defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions which in turn could adversely affect our reputation competitiveness and results of operations a cyberattack or other disruption may also result in financial loss including potential fines for failure to safeguard data or losses in connection with any litigation that may result from a cyberattack our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs arising from such events 

we have taken steps and incurred costs to further strengthen the security of our computer systems and continue to assess maintain and enhance the ongoing effectiveness of our information security systems while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including employee training comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems our systems networks products solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats the techniques used by criminals to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive data 

nordson corporation 12 

change frequently and often are not recognizable until launched against a target accordingly we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures it is therefore possible that in the future we may suffer a criminal attack unauthorized parties may gain access to personal information in our possession and we may not be able to identify any such incident in a timely manner 

the interpretation and application of data protection laws including federal state and international laws relating to the collection use retention disclosure security and transfer of personally identifiable data in the us europe and elsewhere including but not limited to the european union’s gdpr the brazilian general data protection law and the ccpa are uncertain and evolving it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices in addition as a result of existing or new data protection requirements we incur and expect to continue to incur significant ongoing operating costs as part of our significant efforts to protect and safeguard our sensitive data and personal information these efforts also may divert management and employee attention from other business and growth initiatives a breach in information privacy could result in legal or reputational risks and could have a negative impact on our revenues and results of operations 

if our intellectual property protection is inadequate others may be able to use our technologies and tradenames and thereby reduce our ability to compete which could have a material adverse effect on us our financial condition and results of operations 

we regard much of the technology underlying our products and the trademarks under which we market our products as proprietary the steps we take to protect our proprietary technology may be inadequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or third parties may independently develop similar technology we rely on a combination of patents trademark copyright and trade secret laws employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and other contracts to establish and protect our technology and other intellectual property rights the agreements may be breached or terminated and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach and existing trade secrets patent and copyright law afford us limited protection policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult a third party could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization litigation may be necessary for us to defend against claims of infringement or to protect our intellectual property rights and could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our efforts further we might not prevail in such litigation which could harm our business 

our products could infringe on the intellectual property of others which may cause us to engage in costly litigation and if we are not successful could cause us to pay substantial damages and prohibit us from selling our products 

third parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us based on their patents or other intellectual property claims and we may have to pay substantial damages possibly including treble damages if it is ultimately determined our products infringe we may have to obtain a license to sell our products if it is determined that our products infringe upon another party’s intellectual property we might be prohibited from selling our products before we obtain a license which if available at all may require us to pay substantial royalties even if infringement claims against us are without merit defending these types of lawsuits takes significant time may be expensive and may divert management attention from other business concerns 

risks related to the execution of our strategy 

we continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment and we cannot be certain that our business operating results and financial condition will not be materially and adversely affected 

a successful divestiture depends on various factors including reaching an agreement with potential buyers on terms we deem attractive as well as our ability to effectively transfer liabilities contracts facilities and employees to any purchaser identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to retain reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business and collect the proceeds from any divestitures these efforts require varying levels of management resources which may divert our attention from other business operations if we do not realize the expected benefits of any divestiture transaction our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted in addition divestitures of businesses involve a number of risks including significant costs and expenses the loss of customer relationships and a decrease in revenues and earnings associated with the divested business furthermore divestitures potentially involve significant postclosing separation activities which could involve the expenditure of material financial resources and significant employee resources any divestiture may result in a dilutive impact to our future earnings if we are unable to offset the dilutive impact from the loss of revenue associated with the divestiture as well as significant writeoffs including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

if we fail to develop new products or enhance existing products or our customers do not accept the new or enhanced products we develop our revenue and profitability could be adversely impacted 

innovation is critical to our success we believe that we must continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and manufacture new products with improved capabilities in order to continue to be a leading provider of precision technology solutions we also believe that we must continue to make improvements in our productivity in order to maintain our competitive position difficulties or delays in research development or production of new or enhanced products or failure to gain market acceptance of new or enhanced products and technologies may reduce future sales and adversely affect our competitive position we continue to invest in the development and marketing of new or enhanced products there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses if we fail to make innovations launch products with quality problems or the market does not accept our new products our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected in addition as new or enhanced products are introduced we must successfully manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption in customers’ ordering patterns avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that we can deliver sufficient supplies of new products to meet customers’ demands 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions and we may not be able to execute on our acquisition strategy or integrate acquisitions successfully 

our recent historical growth has depended and our future growth is likely to continue to depend in part on our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses into our existing operations for example in november 2022 we completed our acquisition of cyberoptics we intend to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world we cannot assure we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition opportunities prevail against competing potential acquirers negotiate appropriate acquisition terms obtain financing that may be needed to consummate such acquisitions complete proposed acquisitions successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new markets in addition we cannot assure that any acquisition including the recent acquisition of cyberoptics once successfully integrated will perform as planned be accretive to earnings or prove to be beneficial to our operations and cash flow 

the success of our acquisition strategy is subject to other risks and uncertainties including 

• our ability to realize operating efficiencies synergies or other benefits expected from an acquisition and possible delays in realizing the benefits of the acquired company or products 

• diversion of management’s time and attention from other business concerns 

• difficulties in retaining key employees customers or suppliers of the acquired business 

• difficulties in maintaining uniform standards controls procedures and policies throughout acquired companies 

• adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers or customers 

• the risks associated with the assumption of product liabilities or contingent or undisclosed liabilities of acquisition targets and 

• the ability to generate future cash flows or the availability of financing 

in addition an acquisition could adversely impact our operating performance as a result of the incurrence of acquisitionrelated debt preacquisition potential tax liabilities acquisition expenses the amortization of acquisitionacquired assets or possible future impairments of goodwill or intangible assets associated with the acquisition 

we may also face liability with respect to acquired businesses for violations of environmental laws occurring prior to the date of our acquisition and some or all of these liabilities may not be covered by environmental insurance secured to mitigate the risk or by indemnification from the sellers from which we acquired these businesses we could also incur significant costs including but not limited to remediation costs natural resources damages civil or criminal fines and sanctions and thirdparty claims as a result of past or future violations of or liabilities associated with environmental laws 

any impairment in the value of our intangible assets including goodwill would negatively affect our operating results and total capitalization 

our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets primarily goodwill the goodwill results from our acquisitions and represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the identifiable net assets we acquired we assess at least annually whether there has been any impairment in the value of our intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels if competing or alternative technologies emerge if market conditions for acquired businesses decline if significant and prolonged negative industry or economic trends exist if our stock 

nordson corporation 14 

price and market capitalization declines or if future cash flow estimates decline we could incur under current applicable accounting rules a noncash charge to operating earnings for goodwill impairment any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and equity book value the effect of which could be material 

risks related to legal compliance and regulatory matters 

changes in united states and international tax laws may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions changes in applicable domestic or foreign tax laws and regulations or their interpretation and application including the possibility of retroactive effect could affect our business financial condition and profitability by increasing our tax liabilities our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in our effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates changes in our overall profitability changes in tax legislation and rates changes in generally accepted accounting principles and changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the us federal government may adopt changes to international trade agreements tariffs taxes and other government rules and regulations while we cannot predict what changes will actually occur with respect to any of these items such changes could affect our business and results of operations 

we may be exposed to liabilities under the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are subject to compliance with various laws and regulations including the fcpa uk bribery act and similar worldwide antibribery and anticorruption laws which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or making other improper payments to private or public parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining an unfair business advantage the fcpa also requires proper record keeping and characterization of such payments in our reports filed with the sec our employees are trained and required to comply with these laws and we are committed to legal compliance and corporate ethics violations of these laws could result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and financial penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition or results of operations 

the level of returns on pension plan assets changes in the actuarial assumptions used and management of pension liabilities could adversely affect us 

our operating results may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of expense we record for our defined benefit pension plans us gaap requires that we calculate pension expense using actuarial valuations which are dependent upon our various assumptions including estimates of expected longterm rate of return on plan assets discount rates for future payment obligations and the expected rate of increase in future compensation levels our pension expense and funding requirements may also be affected by our actual return on plan assets and by legislation and other government regulatory actions changes in assumptions laws or regulations and how the company manages pension liabilities could lead to variability in financial results and could have a material adverse impact on liquidity 

our global operations are subject to increasingly complex environmental regulatory requirements and compliance with evolving environmental regulatory requirements could negatively impact our business capital expenditures results of operations financial condition and competitive position 

we are subject to increasingly complex environmental regulations affecting international manufacturers including those related to air and water emissions waste management and climate change some environmental laws impose strict retroactive and joint and several liability for the remediation of the release of hazardous substances even for conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or for the conduct of or conditions caused by prior operators predecessors or third parties failure to comply with environmental laws could expose us to penalties or cleanup costs civil or criminal liability and sanctions on certain of our activities as well as damage to property or natural resources these liabilities sanctions damages and remediation efforts related to any noncompliance with such laws and regulations could negatively impact our ability to conduct our operations and our financial condition and results of operations in addition there can be no assurances that we will not be adversely affected by costs liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations or under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future 

changes in environmental laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments and uncertainty relating to environmental laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions could subject us to additional costs and restrictions including increased energy and raw material 

nordson corporation 15 

costs if environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products they could negatively impact our business capital expenditures results of operations financial condition and competitive position 

it is our policy to apply strict standards for environmental protection to all of our operations within and outside of the united states even when we are not subject to local government regulations we may incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and civil or criminal sanctions liabilities resulting from thirdparty property damage or personal injury claims or our products could be prohibited from entering certain jurisdictions if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws if our products become noncompliant with environmental laws or if we were to undertake environmental protection actions voluntarily 

expectations relating to environmental social and governance considerations expose us to potential liabilities increased costs reputational harm and other adverse effects on our business 

many governments regulators investors employees customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental social and governance considerations relating to businesses including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions human capital and diversity equity and inclusion we make statements about our environmental social and governance goals and initiatives through information provided on our website press statements and other communications including through our esg report responding to these environmental social and governance considerations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties requires investments and are impacted by factors that may be outside our control in addition some stakeholders may disagree with our goals and initiatives and the focus of stakeholders may change and evolve over time stakeholders also may have very different views on where environmental social and governance focus should be placed including differing views of regulators in various jurisdictions in which we operate any failure or perceived failure by us to achieve our goals further our initiatives adhere to our public statements comply with federal state or international environmental social and governance laws and regulations or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against us and materially adversely affect our business reputation results of operations financial condition and stock price 

risks related to our capital structure 

our inability to comply with our existing credit facilities’ restrictive covenants or to access additional sources of capital could impede our growth or the repayment or refinancing of existing indebtedness 

the limits imposed on us by the restrictive covenants contained in our credit facilities could prevent us from making acquisitions or cause us to lose access to these facilities 

our existing credit facilities contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to among other things 

• borrow money or guarantee the debts of others 

• use assets as security in other transactions 

• make restricted payments or distributions and 

• sell or acquire assets or merge with or into other companies 

in addition our credit facilities require us to meet financial ratios including a “leverage ratio” and an “interest coverage ratio” both as defined in the credit facilities 

these restrictions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs and could otherwise restrict our financing activities 

our ability to comply with the covenants and other terms of our credit facilities will depend on our future operating performance if we fail to comply with such covenants and terms we may be in default and the maturity of the related debt could be accelerated and become immediately due and payable we may be required to obtain waivers from our lenders in order to maintain compliance under our credit facilities including waivers with respect to our compliance with certain financial covenants if we are unable to obtain necessary waivers and the debt under our credit facilities is accelerated we would be required to obtain replacement financing at prevailing market rates 

we may need new or additional financing in the future to expand our business or refinance existing indebtedness if we are unable to access capital on satisfactory terms and conditions we may not be able to expand our business or meet our payment requirements under our existing credit facilities our ability to obtain new or additional financing will depend on a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control we may not be able to obtain new or additional financing because we have substantial debt or because we may not have sufficient cash flow to service or repay our existing or future debt in addition depending on market conditions and our financial performance neither debt nor equity financing may be available on 

nordson corporation 16 

satisfactory terms or at all finally as a consequence of worsening financial market conditions our credit facility providers may not provide the agreed credit if they become undercapitalized 

changes in interest rates could adversely affect us 

any period of interest rate increases may adversely affect our profitability as of october 31 2022 we had  738822 of total debt outstanding of which 35 percent was priced at interest rates that float with the market a one percentage point increase in the interest rate on the floating rate debt in 2022 would have resulted in approximately 2841 of additional interest expense a higher level of floating rate debt would increase the exposure to changes in interest rates for additional detail related to this risk see part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

general risk factors 

the insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures 

we maintain property business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered we are potentially at risk if one or more of our insurance carriers fail or deny our claims additionally severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the ratings and survival of some insurers in the future we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain 

our business and operating results may be adversely affected by natural disasters or other catastrophic events beyond our control 

while we have taken precautions to prevent production and service interruptions at our global facilities severe weather conditions including any that may be caused by global climate change such as hurricanes or tornadoes as well as major earthquakes wildfires and other natural disasters in areas in which we have manufacturing facilities or from which we obtain products may cause physical damage to our properties closure of one or more of our manufacturing or distribution facilities lack of an adequate work force in a market temporary disruption in the supply of inventory disruption in the transport of products and utilities and delays in the delivery of products to our customers any of these factors may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses on an ongoing basis we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that are used to prepare financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates used by management 

certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below on a regular basis critical accounting policies are reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 

revenue recognition  a contract exists when it has approval and commitment from both parties the rights of the parties are identified payment terms are identified the contract has commercial substance and collectability of the consideration is probable revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of the contract with a customer are satisfied generally our revenue results from shortterm fixedprice contracts and is recognized as of a point in time when the product is shipped or at a later point when the control of the product transfers to the customer refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding the companys revenue recognition policy 

business combinations  the acquisitions of our businesses are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting the amounts assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions are based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition with the remainder if any recorded as goodwill the fair values are determined by management taking into consideration information supplied by the management of the acquired entities and other relevant information such information typically includes valuations obtained from independent appraisal experts which management reviews and considers in its estimates of fair values the valuations are generally based upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets discounted to present value the determination of fair values requires significant judgment by management particularly with respect to the value of identifiable intangible assets this judgment could result in either a higher or lower value assigned to amortizable or depreciable assets the impact could result in either higher or lower amortization andor depreciation expense 

goodwill  goodwill is the excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in various business combinations goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level or more often if indications of impairment exist 

we test goodwill in accordance with accounting standards codification asc 350 we did not record any goodwill impairment charges in 2022 we use an independent valuation specialist to assist with refining our assumptions and methods used to determine fair values to test for goodwill impairment we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units using a combination of the income approach and the market approach effective in the fourth quarter of 2022 we realigned our former two operating segments into three industrial precision solutions medical and fluid solutions and advanced technology solutions previously advanced technology solutions was comprised of medical and fluid solutions and the former advanced technology solutions our segment change did not have any impact on our reporting units 

the discounted cash flow method income approach uses assumptions for revenue growth operating margin and working capital turnover that are based on management’s strategic plans tempered by performance trends and reasonable expectations about those trends terminal value calculations employ a published formula known as the gordon growth model method that essentially captures the present value of perpetual cash flows beyond the last projected period assuming a constant weighted average cost of capital wacc methodology and growth rate for each reporting unit a sensitivity analysis is performed to vary the discount and terminal growth rates in order to provide a range of reasonableness for detecting impairment discount rates are developed using a wacc methodology 

nordson corporation 23 

the wacc represents the blended average required rate of return for equity and debt capital based on observed market return data and company specific risk factors for 2022 the wacc rates used ranged from 83 percent to 110 percent depending upon the reporting units size end market volatility and projection risk see note 6  goodwill and intangible assets for further details regarding the valuation methodologies used 

in 2022 2021 and 2020 the results of our annual impairment tests indicated no impairment 

the fair value fv was compared to the carrying value cv for each reporting unit based on the results shown in the table below and based on our measurement date of august 1 2022 our conclusion is that no goodwill was impaired in 2022 potential events or circumstances such as a sustained downturn in global economies could have a negative effect on estimated fair values 



pension plan in the united states  the measurement of the liabilities related to our domestic pension plan is based on management’s assumptions related to future factors including interest rates return on pension plan assets compensation increases mortality and turnover assumptions and health care cost trend rates the liabilities associated with the companys international pension plans and opeb are not as materially sensitive to changes in assumptions as the pension plan in the united states 

the weightedaverage discount rate used to determine the present value of our domestic pension plan obligations was 570 percent at october 31 2022 and 302 percent at october 31 2021 the discount rate used was determined by using quality fixed income investments with a duration period approximately equal to the period over which pension obligations are expected to be settled 

in determining the expected return on plan assets we consider both historical performance and an estimate of future longterm rates of return on assets similar to those in our plans we consult with and consider the opinions of financial and actuarial experts in developing appropriate return assumptions the expected rate of return longterm investment rate on domestic pension assets used to determine net benefit costs was 575 percent in both 2022 and 2021 

the assumed rate of compensation increases used to determine the present value of our domestic pension plan obligations was 430 percent and 400 percent at october 31 2022 and october 31 2021 respectively 

annual expense amounts are determined based on the discount rate used at the end of the prior year differences between actual and assumed investment returns on pension plan assets result in actuarial gains or losses that are amortized into expense over a period of years 

economic assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported the effect of a one percent change in the discount rate expected return on assets and compensation increase is shown in the table below bracketed numbers represent decreases in expense and obligation amounts 



nordson corporation 24 

income taxes – income taxes are estimated based on income for financial reporting purposes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes and certain changes in valuation allowances we provide valuation allowances against deferred tax assets if based on available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

management believes the valuation allowances are adequate after considering future taxable income allowable carryforward periods and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize the deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount including the valuation allowance an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made conversely should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be expensed in the period such determination was made 

further at each interim reporting period we estimate an effective income tax rate that is expected to be applicable for the full year significant judgment is involved regarding the application of global income tax laws and regulations and when projecting the jurisdictional mix of income additionally interpretation of tax laws court decisions or other guidance provided by taxing authorities influences our estimate of the effective income tax rates as a result our actual effective income tax rates and related income tax liabilities may differ materially from our estimated effective tax rates and related income tax liabilities any resulting differences are recorded in the period they become known 

cyberoptics acquisition 

on november 3 2022 the company completed the acquisition of cyberoptics corporation “cyberoptics” pursuant to the terms of the agreement and plan of merger dated as of august 7 2022 by and among the company meta merger company and cyberoptics cyberoptics is a leading global developer and manufacturer of highprecision 3d optical sensing technology solutions the cyberoptics acquisition expanded our test and inspection platform providing differentiated technology that expands our product offering in the semiconductor and electronics industries and will be reported in our advanced technology solutions segment the allcash transaction of approximately 380000 net of cash acquired was funded using our revolving credit facility and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

results of operations 

effective in the fourth quarter of 2022 we realigned and separated our two former operating segments into the following three operating segments industrial precision solutions medical and fluid solutions and advanced technology solutions previously advanced technology solutions was comprised of medical and fluid solutions and the former advanced technology solutions existing product lines were unchanged as part of this new structure we made these changes to realign our management team and our operating segments we believe this realignment gives us better visibility into our medical and electronics platforms which have grown significantly through both organic and acquisitive opportunities including through the recent acquisition of cyberoptics we also believe that the three revised operating segments better reflect how we now manage the company allocate resources and assess performance of the businesses we also revised our geographic regions such that the united states and japan are now included in the americas and asia pacific regions respectively as such our geographical regions as used throughout this annual report include the americas united states canada mexico and central and south america asia pacific including japan and europe 

below is a detailed discussion comparison of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended october 31 2022 and october 31 2021 as well as a comparison of sales and segment results for fiscal years october 31 2021 and october 31 2020 due to our change in operating segments and geographic regions for a discussion of other changes from the fiscal year ended october 31 2021 to the fiscal year ended october 31 2020 refer to part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended october 31 2021

effects of foreign currency 

the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on sales and operating results cannot be precisely measured due to fluctuating selling prices sales volume product mix and cost structures in each country where we operate as a general rule a weakening of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies has a favorable effect on sales and net income while a strengthening of the dollar has a detrimental effect 

in 2022 as compared with 2021 the united states dollar was generally stronger against foreign currencies if 2021 exchange rates had been in effect during 2022 sales would have been approximately 103829 higher and thirdparty costs would have been approximately 68788 higher in 2021 as compared with 2020 the united states dollar was generally weaker against foreign currencies if 2020 exchange rates had been in effect during 2021 sales would have been approximately 55200 lower and thirdparty costs would have been approximately 24600 lower these effects on reported sales do not include the impact of local price adjustments made in response to changes in currency exchange rates

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we operate internationally and enter into intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies consequently we are subject to market risk arising from exchange rate movements between the dates foreign currencies are recorded and the dates they are settled we regularly use foreign exchange contracts to reduce our risks related to most of these transactions these contracts primarily associated with the euro yen and pound sterling typically have maturities of 90 days or less and generally require the exchange of foreign currencies for united states dollars at rates stated in the contracts gains and losses from changes in the market value of these contracts offset foreign exchange losses and gains respectively on the underlying transactions we use foreign exchange contracts on a routine basis to help mitigate the risks related to transactions denominated in foreign currencies 

refer to note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion about our foreign currency transactions and the methods and assumptions used to record these transactions 

a portion of our operations is financed with shortterm and longterm borrowings and is subject to market risk arising from changes in interest rates 

the tables that follow present principal repayments and weightedaverage interest rates on outstanding borrowings of fixedrate debt 





we also have variablerate longterm debt the weighted average interest rate of this variablerate debt was 174 percent at october 31 2022 and 071 percent at october 31 2021 a one percent increase in interest rates would have resulted in additional interest expense of approximately 2841 on the variable rate longterm debt in 2022

manufacturing raw materials and other resources 

our production operations include machining molding and assembly we manufacture specially designed parts and assemble components into finished equipment many components are made in standard modules that can be used in more than one product or in combination with other components for a variety of models we have principal manufacturing operations and sources of supply in the united states in ohio georgia california colorado connecticut illinois massachusetts michigan minnesota new jersey rhode island tennessee and wisconsin as well as in the people’s republic of china germany ireland israel mexico the netherlands thailand and the united kingdom 

principal materials used to make our products are metals and plastics typically in sheets bar stock castings forgings tubing and pellets we also purchase many electrical and electronic components fabricated metal parts highpressure fluid hoses packings seals and other items integral to our products suppliers are competitively selected based on cost quality and service all significant raw materials that we use are available through multiple sources we purchase most raw materials and other components on the open market and rely on third parties to provide certain finished goods while these items are generally available from multiple sources the cost of products sold may be affected by changes in the market price of raw materials and tariffs on certain raw materials particularly imports from china as well as disruptions in availability of raw materials components and sourced finished goods 

we monitor and investigate alternative suppliers and materials based on numerous attributes including quality service and price we currently source raw materials and components from a number of suppliers but our ongoing efforts to improve the cost effectiveness of our products and services may result in a reduction in the number of our suppliers 

senior operating management supervises an extensive quality control program for our equipment machinery and systems and manufacturing processes 

natural gas and other fuels are our primary energy sources however standby capacity for alternative sources is available if needed 

the covid19 pandemic has disrupted the global supply chain to a certain extent we have not experienced significant supply disruption from thirdparty component suppliers as a result of the covid19 pandemic however we have faced and continue to face some supply chain constraints primarily related to logistics including higher freight rates in addition shipments between countries have been more impacted by the covid19 pandemic and we have experienced delays due to a variety of factors 

intellectual property 

we maintain procedures to protect our intellectual property including patents trademarks and copyrights both domestically and internationally risk factors associated with our intellectual property are discussed in part i item 1a risk factors 

our intellectual property portfolios include valuable patents trade secrets knowhow domain names trademarks and trade names as of october 31 2020 we held 564 united states patents and 1362 foreign patents and had 142 united states patent applications pending and 787 foreign patent applications pending but there is no assurance that any patent application will be issued we continue to apply for and obtain patent protection for new products on an ongoing basis 

patents covering individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of filing or grant and the legal term of patents in various countries where a patent is obtained our patent portfolio as of october 31 2020 had expiration dates ranging from november 2020 to august 2039 the actual protection a patent provides which can vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in each country we believe however that the duration of our patents generally exceeds the life cycles of the technologies disclosed and claimed in the patents 

we believe our trademarks are important assets and we aggressively manage our brands we also own a number of trademarks in the united states and foreign countries including registered trademarks for nordson asymtek avalon dage efd march sonoscan value plastics vention xaloy and yestech and various common law trademarks which are important to our 

nordson corporation 7 

table of co ntents 

business inasmuch as they identify nordson and our products to our customers as of october 31 2020 we had a total of 1056 trademark registrations in the united states and in various foreign countries 

we rely upon a combination of nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights and also enter into confidentiality and intellectual property agreements with our employees that require them to disclose any inventions created during employment convey all rights to inventions to us and restrict the distribution of proprietary information 

we protect and promote our intellectual property portfolio and take those actions we deem appropriate to enforce our intellectual property rights and to defend our right to sell our products although in the aggregate our intellectual property is important to our operations we do not believe that the loss of any one patent or trademark or group of related patents or trademarks would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position of our overall business 

seasonal variation in business 

generally the highest volume of sales occurs in the second half of the year due in large part to the timing of customers’ capital spending programs accordingly first quarter sales volume is typically the lowest of the year due to timing of customers’ capital spending programs and customer holiday shutdowns 

working capital practices 

no special or unusual practices affect our working capital we generally require advance payments as deposits on customized equipment and systems and in certain cases require progress payments during the manufacturing of these products we continue to initiate new processes focused on reduction of manufacturing lead times resulting in lower investment in inventory while maintaining the capability to respond promptly to customer needs 

competitive conditions 

we operate in a competitive global marketplace and compete with many large well established and highly competitive manufacturers and service providers our business is affected by a range of macroeconomic conditions including industry capacity changes global competition and economic conditions in the us and abroad as well as fluctuations in currency exchange rates our equipment is sold in competition with a wide variety of alternative bonding sealing finishing coating processing testing inspecting and fluid control techniques potential uses for our equipment include any production processes that require preparation modification or curing of surfaces dispensing application processing or control of fluids and materials or testing and inspecting for quality 

many factors influence our competitive position including pricing product quality and service we maintain a leadership position in our business segments by delivering highquality innovative products and technologies as well as service and technical support working with customers to understand their processes and developing the application solutions that help them meet their production requirements also contributes to our leadership position our worldwide network of direct sales and technical resources also is a competitive advantage the impact of tariffs over our end markets in asia could negatively affect our longterm market position in that region 

compliance with governmental regulations 

as a us public company that supports manufacturing designing and servicing highly complex products in regulatory environments our global operations are subject to a variety of laws regulations and compliance obligations we have robust internal controls quality management systems and management systems of compliance that govern our internal actions and mitigate our risk of noncompliance we also have safeguards established to identify noncompliance concerns through internal and external audits and risk assessments as well as an ethics helpline reporting system 

we are also required to comply with increasingly complex and changing laws and regulations enacted to protect business and personal data in the united states and other jurisdictions regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage use transmission and protection of personal information and other consumer customer vendor or employee data such privacy and data protection laws and regulations including with respect to the european union’s general data protection regulation gdpr the brazilian general data protection law and the california consumer privacy act of 2018 ccpa and the interpretation and enforcement of such laws and regulations are continuously developing and evolving and there is significant uncertainty with respect to how compliance with these laws and regulations may evolve and the costs and complexity of future compliance 

we are also subject to federal state local and foreign environmental safety and health laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to land and water and the generation handling treatment and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials under certain of these laws we can be held strictly liable for hazardous substance 

nordson corporation 8 

table of co ntents 

contamination of any real property we have ever owned operated or used as a disposal site or for natural resource damages associated with such contamination we are also required to maintain various related permits and licenses many of which require periodic modification and renewal the operation of manufacturing plants unavoidably entails environmental safety and health risks and we could incur material unanticipated costs or liabilities in the future if any of these risks were realized in ways or to an extent that we did not anticipate 

we believe that we operate in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations compliance with environmental laws and regulations requires continuing management effort and expenditures we have incurred and will continue to incur costs and capital expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations and to obtain and maintain the necessary permits and licenses we believe that the cost of complying with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our earnings liquidity or competitive position but cannot assure that material compliancerelated costs and expenses may not arise in the future for example future adoption of new or amended environmental laws regulations or requirements or newly discovered contamination or other circumstances could require us to incur costs and expenses that may have a material effect but cannot be presently anticipated 

we believe that policies practices and procedures have been properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of material environmental damage arising from our operations we accrue for estimated environmental liabilities with charges to expense and believe our environmental accrual is adequate to provide for our portion of the costs of all such known environmental liabilities compliance with federal state local and foreign environmental protection laws during 2020 had no material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position based upon consideration of currently available information we believe liabilities for environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position operating results or liquidity but we cannot assure that material environmental liabilities may not arise in the future

human capital resources 

employee profile 

as of october 31 2020 we had 7555 fulltime and parttime employees including 137 at our amherst ohio facility who are represented by a collective bargaining agreement that expires on november 12 2022 

health and safety 

the health and safety of our employees is our highest priority and this is consistent with our operating philosophy when the pandemic first impacted our employees in china we began hosting crossfunctional global team meetings to proactively manage employee safety teams from around the world came together to ensure our employees had access to masks thermometers protective gloves and sanitizing supplies in order to protect not only themselves but their families as well this nordson spirit continued as the virus spread around the world closely following the recommendations of the world health organization the us centers for disease control and local governments we took action to ensure our employees were safe 

• adjusted work schedules to allow the proper amount of social distance between employees 

• increased hygiene cleaning and sanitizing procedures at all locations 

• implemented temperaturetaking protocols upon entering facilities 

• provided additional personal protective equipment to employees 

• enabled employees to work from home where possible 

• restricted travel and encouraged quarantine upon return 

• developed a special covid19 pandemic leave policy that encouraged employees to take time off for illness or caretaking while maintaining steady wages 

• established strict protocols and screening for outside guests and 

• launched a covid19 pandemic intranet site to increase communications and ensure our employees had access to uptodate and accurate information 

we manufacture products deemed essential to critical infrastructure industries including health and safety food and agriculture and energy and as a result all of our production sites have continued to operate during the covid19 pandemic as such we have invested in creating physically safe work environments for our employees

total rewards 

as part of our compensation philosophy we believe that we must offer and maintain market competitive total rewards programs for our employees in order to attract and retain superior talent these programs not only include base wages and incentives in support of our pay for performance culture but also health welfare and retirement benefits we focus many programs on employee wellness and have implemented solutions including mental health support access telemedicine and healthy weight loss programs we believe that these solutions have helped us successfully manage healthcare and prescription drug costs for our employee population 

in the us we match contributions to a taxqualified defined contribution retirement savings plan the “savings plan” for all eligible employees in an amount equal to 50 cents for every dollar contributed by the employee until the employee contributions reach six percent of her or his base compensation all contributions by employees into the savings plan are fully vested immediately company contributions have a threeyear graded vesting schedule and vest at 33 13 each year until fully vested after 3 years of employment we also maintain a nonqualified unfunded and unsecured deferred compensation plan for the benefit of eligible management employees whose benefits under the savings plan are limited by the benefit restrictions of section 415 of the internal revenue code in addition all eligible nonunion employees participate in a companysponsored taxqualified pension plan for usbased salaried employees the “salaried pension plan” the salaried pension plan is designed to work together with social security benefits to provide employees with 30 years of service retirement income that is approximately 55 of eligible compensation subject to the internal revenue code maximum monthly benefit participants fully vest in the salaried pension plan after 5 years of service all eligible union employees participate in a companysponsored taxqualified pension plan for usbased hourly employees the “hourly pension plan” the hourly pension plan provides a multiplier for each year of service to supplement employees’ retirement income we also maintain a supplemental retirement benefit restoration plan “excess defined benefit pension plan” which is an unfunded nonqualified plan that is designed to provide retirement benefits to usbased eligible participants as a replacement for those retirement benefits limited by regulations under the internal revenue code 

together the pension plan and excess defined benefit pension plan are intended to provide executive officers with retirement income at a level equivalent to that provided to other employees under the pension plan 

we also provide service awards which show appreciation and thanks to longstanding employees with 5 or more years of service service milestones are recognized at each fiveyear increment by presentation of a digital andor printed certificate with an invitation to select a recognition award via an online catalog 

talent 

our key talent philosophy is to develop talent from within and supplement with external hires this approach has yielded a deep understanding among our employee base of our business products and customers while adding new employees and ideas in support of our continuous improvement mindset we believe that our average tenure across the globe – 1018 years as of the end of the fiscal year 2020 – reflects the strong engagement of our employees and is reflective of our positive workplace culture our talent acquisition team uses internal and external resources to recruit highly skilled and talented workers and we encourage employee referrals for open positions 

talent development and succession planning for critical roles is a cornerstone of our talent program development plans are created and monitored for critical roles to ensure progress is made along the established timelines development plans also intersect with our mission particularly as we strive to be responsible to our communities 

one of our core values—respect for people—reflects the behavior we strive to include in every aspect of the way we conduct business our diversity and inclusion initiatives support our goal that everyone throughout the company is engaged in creating an inclusive workplace and we have begun work on building diverse talent pools as part of our recruitment efforts we strive to promote inclusion through “inclusive leadership” training across the company with the support of our board of directors we continue to explore additional diversity and inclusion initiatives 

community 

at nordson we have a long and proud history of investing in the communities where we live and work through the nordson corporation foundation the “foundation” we give back by providing grants to nonprofits in communities where we have facilities employing more than 100 people in recent years we have extended our reach internationally with giving programs in nine international locations since 1989 we have donated more than 113 million to communities where we live and work in addition our employees volunteered more than 106000 hours through our time ‘n talent program 

in response to the covid19 pandemic the foundation donated to give2asia to support frontline healthcare workers battling the spread of the novel coronavirus in china the foundation also donated 1 million from its assets toward the global covid19 pandemic response these funds were split evenly among communities in the united states and other countries reflecting the roughly equal split of where our employees work a donation of 500000 was split among usbased non

 item 1a risk factors 

in an enterprise as diverse as ours a wide range of factors could affect future performance we discuss in this section some of the risk factors that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition value and results of operations you should consider these risk factors in connection with evaluating the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k because these factors could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected in forwardlooking statements 

risks related to the covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic has negatively disrupted and may continue to have a negative impact which could be material on our ability to operate results of operations financial condition liquidity and capital investments 

in march 2020 the world health organization categorized the covid19 pandemic outbreak as a pandemic and the president of the united states declared the covid19 pandemic outbreak a national emergency covid19 continues to spread and intensify throughout the united states and other countries across the world and the ultimate duration and severity of its effects are currently unknown the covid19 pandemic has resulted in governments around the world implementing increasingly stringent measures to help control the spread of the virus including quarantines social distancing protocols “shelter in place” and “stay at home” orders travel restrictions business curtailments school closures and other measures in addition governments and central banks in several parts of the world have enacted fiscal and monetary stimulus measures to counteract the impacts of the covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic has negatively disrupted and may continue to negatively impact our business while we have continued to operate during the course of the covid19 pandemic in all of our production facilities and have supported multiple “critical infrastructure” sectors by manufacturing materials and products needed for medical supply chains packaging transportation energy communications and other critical infrastructure industries we have experienced unfavorable impacts on our manufacturing efficiencies due to the implementation of worker safety measures and cost increases from covid19 pandemicrelated supply disruptions we have invested and will continue to invest significant time and resources in modifying our business practices for the continued health and safety of our employees and in managing the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our global business our focus on managing and mitigating the impacts of the covid19 pandemic on our business including complying with any new or modified government health regulations for an unknown period of time may cause us to divert or delay the application of our resources toward other or new initiatives or investments which may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

governments around the world have implemented fiscal stimulus measures to counteract the effects of the covid19 pandemic the magnitude and overall effectiveness of these actions remain uncertain the full extent to which the covid19 pandemic will impact our business going forward will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted including but not limited to the duration and severity of the covid19 pandemic actions by government authorities to contain the outbreak or treat its impact such as reimposing previously lifted measures or putting in place additional restrictions the widespread distribution and acceptance of an effective vaccine and the extent and severity of the impact on our customers operations and suppliers all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted our future results of operations and liquidity could be adversely impacted by delays in payments of outstanding receivable amounts beyond normal payment terms supply chain disruptions and uncertain demand 

additionally to the extent the covid19 pandemic adversely affects our business results of operations or financial condition it may heighten other risks described in this “risk factors” section below 

nordson corporation 11 

table of co ntents 

risks related to economic conditions 

changes in united states or international economic conditions including declines in the industries we serve could adversely affect the profitability of any of our operations 

in 2020 approximately 36 percent of our revenue was generated in the united states while approximately 64 percent was generated outside the united states the covid19 pandemic and related preventative and mitigation measures implemented by governments around the world have to date negatively impacted the global economy and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets 

a general sustained slowdown in the global economy or in a particular region or industry or an increase in trade tensions with us trading partners could negatively impact our business financial condition or liquidity our largest markets include consumer nondurable industrial medical electronics consumer durable and automotive a slowdown in any of these specific end markets could directly affect our revenue stream and profitability 

a portion of our product sales is attributable to industries and markets such as the electronics polymer processing and metal finishing industries which historically have been cyclical and sensitive to relative changes in supply and demand and general economic conditions the demand for our products depends in part on the general economic conditions of the industries or national economies of our customers downward economic cycles in our customers’ industries or countries may reduce sales of some of our products it is not possible to predict accurately the factors that will affect demand for our products in the future 

the current significant downturn in the health of the general economy or any recession depression or other sustained adverse market event resulting from the covid19 pandemic could have an adverse effect on our revenues and financial performance resulting in impairment of assets we cannot predict the strength or duration of the current economic slowdown and instability or the timing of any recovery 

our results have been and could continue to be impacted by uncertainty in us trade policy including uncertainty surrounding changes in tariffs trade agreements or other trade restrictions imposed by the us or other governments 

our ability to conduct business can be significantly impacted by changes in tariffs changes or repeals of trade agreements including the impact of the “united statesmexicocanada agreement” with mexico and canada which replaced the north american free trade agreement or the imposition of other trade restrictions or retaliatory actions imposed by various governments other effects of these changes including impacts on the price of raw materials responsive actions from governments and the opportunity for competitors to establish a presence in markets where we participate could also have significant impacts on our results we cannot predict what further action may be taken with respect to tariffs or trade relations between the us and other governments and any further changes in us or international trade policy could have an adverse impact on our business further the level of impact from the covid19 pandemic and the reactions of governmental authorities and others thereto may have significant adverse effects on international trade policy 

significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates or change in monetary policy may harm our financial results 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly with respect to the euro the yen the pound sterling and the chinese yuan any significant change in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business against the united states dollar could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for additional detail related to this risk see part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

a significant portion of our consolidated revenues in 2020 were generated in currencies other than the united states dollar which is our reporting currency we recognize foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from our operations in the period incurred as a result currency fluctuations between the united states dollar and the currencies in which we do business have caused and will continue to cause foreign currency transaction and translation gains and losses which historically have been material and could continue to be material we cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future operating results because of the number of currencies involved the variability of currency exposures and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates we take actions to manage our foreign currency exposure such as entering into hedging transactions where available but we cannot assure that our strategies will adequately protect our consolidated operating results from the effects of exchange rate fluctuations for example uncertainty surrounding the impact of the covid19 pandemic and the effects of brexit have caused increased volatility in global currency exchange rates that have resulted in the strengthening of the united states dollar against the foreign currencies in which we conduct business future adverse consequences arising from the covid19 pandemic and brexit may include continued volatility in exchange rates any significant fluctuation in exchange rates may be harmful to our financial condition and results of operations we also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into united states dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or customers located in or conducting business in a country imposing controls currency devaluations diminish the united states dollar value 

nordson corporation 12 

table of co ntents 

of the currency of the country instituting the devaluation and if they occur or continue for significant periods could adversely affect our earnings or cash flow 

risks related to our business and operations 

the company may be subject to risks relating to organizational changes 

we regularly execute organizational changes such as acquisitions divestitures and realignments to support our growth and cost management strategies we also engage in initiatives aimed to increase productivity efficiencies and cash flow and to reduce costs the company commits significant resources to identify develop and retain key employees to ensure uninterrupted leadership and direction if we are unable to successfully manage these and other organizational changes the ability to complete such activities and realize anticipated synergies or cost savings as well as our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected we cannot offer assurances that any of these initiatives will be beneficial to the extent anticipated or that the estimated efficiency improvements incremental cost savings or cash flow improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all 

political conditions in the us and foreign countries in which we operate could adversely affect us 

we conduct our manufacturing sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and are subject to risks associated with doing business both within and outside the united states in 2020 approximately 64 percent of our total sales were generated outside the united states we expect that international operations and united states export sales will continue to be important to our business for the foreseeable future both sales from international operations and export sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside the united states such risks include but are not limited to the following 

• risks of political or economic instability such as brexit 

• unanticipated or unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations 

• threats of war terrorism or governmental instability 

• changes in tax rates adoption of new tax laws or other additional tax policies and other proposals to reform united states and foreign tax laws that impact how united states multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings 

• restrictions on the transfer of funds into or out of a country 

• potential negative consequences from changes to taxation policies 

• the disruption of operations from labor and political disturbances 

• the imposition of tariffs import or export licensing requirements and other potential changes in trade policies and relations arising from policy initiatives implemented by the us presidential administration 

• exchange controls or other trade restrictions including transfer pricing restrictions when products produced in one country are sold to an affiliated entity in another country and 

• government responses to the covid19 pandemic 

any of these events could reduce the demand for our products limit the prices at which we can sell our products interrupt our supply chain or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operating performance 

our international operations also depend upon favorable trade relations between the us and those foreign countries in which our customers subcontractors and materials suppliers have operations a protectionist trade environment in either the us or those foreign countries in which we do business such as a change in the current tariff structures export compliance or other trade policies may materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our products in foreign markets the current us presidential administration has criticized existing trade agreements and while it remains unclear what actions the current or future administration may take with respect to existing and proposed trade agreements or restrictions on trade generally more stringent export and import controls may be ultimately imposed in the future 

increased information technology it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems networks products solutions and services 

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience cyberattacks to our systems and networks to date we have not experienced any material breaches or material losses related to cyberattacks to conduct our business we rely extensively on information technology systems networks and services some of which are managed hosted and provided by thirdparty service providers increased global it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and those of our thirdparty service providers and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data depending on their nature and scope such threats could potentially lead to the compromising of 

nordson corporation 13 

table of co ntents 

confidential information including but not limited to confidential information relating to customer or employee data improper use of our systems and networks manipulation and destruction of data defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions which in turn could adversely affect our reputation competitiveness and results of operations a cyberattack or other disruption may also result in financial loss including potential fines for failure to safeguard data or losses in connection with any litigation that may result from a cyberattack our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs arising from such events 

we have taken steps and incurred costs to further strengthen the security of our computer systems and continue to assess maintain and enhance the ongoing effectiveness of our information security systems while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including employee training comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems our systems networks products solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats the techniques used by criminals to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive data change frequently and often are not recognizable until launched against a target accordingly we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures it is therefore possible that in the future we may suffer a criminal attack unauthorized parties may gain access to personal information in our possession and we may not be able to identify any such incident in a timely manner 

the interpretation and application of data protection laws including federal state and international laws relating to the collection use retention disclosure security and transfer of personally identifiable data in the us europe and elsewhere including but not limited to the european union’s general data protection regulation the brazilian general data protection law and the california consumer privacy act of 2018 are uncertain and evolving it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices in addition as a result of existing or new data protection requirements we incur and expect to continue to incur significant ongoing operating costs as part of our significant efforts to protect and safeguard our sensitive data and personal information these efforts also may divert management and employee attention from other business and growth initiatives a breach in information privacy could result in legal or reputational risks and could have a negative impact on our revenues and results of operations 

if our intellectual property protection is inadequate others may be able to use our technologies and tradenames and thereby reduce our ability to compete which could have a material adverse effect on us our financial condition and results of operations 

we regard much of the technology underlying our products and the trademarks under which we market our products as proprietary the steps we take to protect our proprietary technology may be inadequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or third parties may independently develop similar technology we rely on a combination of patents trademark copyright and trade secret laws employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and other contracts to establish and protect our technology and other intellectual property rights the agreements may be breached or terminated and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach and existing trade secrets patent and copyright law afford us limited protection policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult a third party could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization litigation may be necessary for us to defend against claims of infringement or to protect our intellectual property rights and could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our efforts further we might not prevail in such litigation which could harm our business 

our products could infringe on the intellectual property of others which may cause us to engage in costly litigation and if we are not successful could cause us to pay substantial damages and prohibit us from selling our products 

third parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us based on their patents or other intellectual property claims and we may have to pay substantial damages possibly including treble damages if it is ultimately determined our products infringe we may have to obtain a license to sell our products if it is determined that our products infringe upon another party’s intellectual property we might be prohibited from selling our products before we obtain a license which if available at all may require us to pay substantial royalties even if infringement claims against us are without merit defending these types of lawsuits takes significant time may be expensive and may divert management attention from other business concerns 

failure to retain our existing senior management team or the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could hurt our business and inhibit our ability to operate and grow successfully 

during 2019 we experienced a leadership change with the appointment of a new president and chief executive officer and in 2020 we appointed a new chief financial officer our success will continue to depend to a significant extent on the continued service of our executive management team and the ability to recruit hire and retain other key management personnel to support our growth and operational initiatives and replace executives who retire or resign failure to retain our leadership team and attract and retain other important management and technical personnel could place a constraint on our global growth and 

nordson corporation 14 

table of co ntents 

operational initiatives possibly resulting in inefficient and ineffective management and operations which would likely harm our revenues operations and product development efforts and eventually result in a decrease in profitability 

risks related to the execution of our strategy 

we continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment and we cannot be certain that our business operating results and financial condition will not be materially and adversely affected 

a successful divestiture depends on various factors including reaching an agreement with potential buyers on terms we deem attractive as well as our ability to effectively transfer liabilities contracts facilities and employees to any purchaser identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to retain reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business and collect the proceeds from any divestitures these efforts require varying levels of management resources which may divert our attention from other business operations if we do not realize the expected benefits of any divestiture transaction our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted in addition divestitures of businesses involve a number of risks including significant costs and expenses the loss of customer relationships and a decrease in revenues and earnings associated with the divested business furthermore divestitures potentially involve significant postclosing separation activities which could involve the expenditure of material financial resources and significant employee resources any divestiture may result in a dilutive impact to our future earnings if we are unable to offset the dilutive impact from the loss of revenue associated with the divestiture as well as significant writeoffs including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

if we fail to develop new products or enhance existing products or our customers do not accept the new or enhanced products we develop our revenue and profitability could be adversely impacted 

innovation is critical to our success we believe that we must continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and manufacture new products with improved capabilities in order to continue to be a leading provider of precision technology solutions we also believe that we must continue to make improvements in our productivity in order to maintain our competitive position difficulties or delays in research development or production of new or enhanced products or failure to gain market acceptance of new or enhanced products and technologies may reduce future sales and adversely affect our competitive position we continue to invest in the development and marketing of new or enhanced products there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses if we fail to make innovations launch products with quality problems or the market does not accept our new products our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected in addition as new or enhanced products are introduced we must successfully manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption in customers’ ordering patterns avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that we can deliver sufficient supplies of new products to meet customers’ demands 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions and we may not be able to execute on our acquisition strategy or integrate acquisitions successfully 

our recent historical growth has depended and our future growth is likely to continue to depend in part on our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses into our existing operations we intend to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world we cannot assure we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition opportunities prevail against competing potential acquirers negotiate appropriate acquisition terms obtain financing that may be needed to consummate such acquisitions complete proposed acquisitions successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new markets in addition we cannot assure that any acquisition once successfully integrated will perform as planned be accretive to earnings or prove to be beneficial to our operations and cash flow 

the success of our acquisition strategy is subject to other risks and uncertainties including 

• our ability to realize operating efficiencies synergies or other benefits expected from an acquisition and possible delays in realizing the benefits of the acquired company or products 

• diversion of management’s time and attention from other business concerns 

• difficulties in retaining key employees customers or suppliers of the acquired business 

• difficulties in maintaining uniform standards controls procedures and policies throughout acquired companies 

• adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers or customers 

nordson corporation 15 

table of co ntents 

• the risks associated with the assumption of product liabilities or contingent or undisclosed liabilities of acquisition targets and 

• the ability to generate future cash flows or the availability of financing 

in addition an acquisition could adversely impact our operating performance as a result of the incurrence of acquisitionrelated debt preacquisition potential tax liabilities acquisition expenses the amortization of acquisitionacquired assets or possible future impairments of goodwill or intangible assets associated with the acquisition 

we may also face liability with respect to acquired businesses for violations of environmental laws occurring prior to the date of our acquisition and some or all of these liabilities may not be covered by environmental insurance secured to mitigate the risk or by indemnification from the sellers from which we acquired these businesses we could also incur significant costs including but not limited to remediation costs natural resources damages civil or criminal fines and sanctions and thirdparty claims as a result of past or future violations of or liabilities associated with environmental laws 

any impairment in the value of our intangible assets including goodwill would negatively affect our operating results and total capitalization 

our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets primarily goodwill the goodwill results from our acquisitions and represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the identifiable net assets we acquired we assess at least annually whether there has been any impairment in the value of our intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels if competing or alternative technologies emerge if market conditions for acquired businesses decline if significant and prolonged negative industry or economic trends exist if our stock price and market capitalization declines or if future cash flow estimates decline we could incur under current applicable accounting rules a noncash charge to operating earnings for goodwill impairment any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and equity book value the effect of which could be material 

risks related to legal compliance and regulatory matters 

changes in united states and international tax law may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions changes in applicable domestic or foreign tax laws and regulations or their interpretation and application including the possibility of retroactive effect could affect our business financial condition and profitability by increasing our tax liabilities our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in our effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates changes in our overall profitability changes in tax legislation and rates changes in generally accepted accounting principles and changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the us federal government may adopt changes to international trade agreements tariffs taxes and other government rules and regulations while we cannot predict what changes will actually occur with respect to any of these items such changes could affect our business and results of operations 

we may be exposed to liabilities under the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are subject to compliance with various laws and regulations including the fcpa uk bribery act and similar worldwide antibribery and anticorruption laws which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or making other improper payments to private or public parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining an unfair business advantage the fcpa also requires proper record keeping and characterization of such payments in our reports filed with the sec our employees are trained and required to comply with these laws and we are committed to legal compliance and corporate ethics violations of these laws could result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and financial penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition or results of operations 

the level of returns on pension plan assets and changes in the actuarial assumptions used could adversely affect us 

our operating results may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of expense we record for our defined benefit pension plans us gaap requires that we calculate pension expense using actuarial valuations which are dependent upon our various assumptions including estimates of expected longterm rate of return on plan assets discount rates for future payment obligations and the expected rate of increase in future compensation levels our pension expense and funding requirements may also be affected by our actual return on plan assets and by legislation and other government regulatory actions changes in

assumptions laws or regulations could lead to variability in operating results and could have a material adverse impact on liquidity 

risks related to our capital structure 

our inability to comply with our existing credit facilities’ restrictive covenants or to access additional sources of capital could impede growth or the repayment or refinancing of existing indebtedness 

the limits imposed on us by the restrictive covenants contained in our credit facilities could prevent us from making acquisitions or cause us to lose access to these facilities 

our existing credit facilities contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to among other things 

• borrow money or guarantee the debts of others 

• use assets as security in other transactions 

• make restricted payments or distributions and 

• sell or acquire assets or merge with or into other companies 

in addition our credit facilities require us to meet financial ratios including a “leverage ratio” and an “interest coverage ratio” both as defined in the credit facilities 

these restrictions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs and could otherwise restrict our financing activities 

our ability to comply with the covenants and other terms of our credit facilities will depend on our future operating performance if we fail to comply with such covenants and terms we may be in default and the maturity of the related debt could be accelerated and become immediately due and payable we may be required to obtain waivers from our lenders in order to maintain compliance under our credit facilities including waivers with respect to our compliance with certain financial covenants if we are unable to obtain necessary waivers and the debt under our credit facilities is accelerated we would be required to obtain replacement financing at prevailing market rates 

we may need new or additional financing in the future to expand our business or refinance existing indebtedness if we are unable to access capital on satisfactory terms and conditions we may not be able to expand our business or meet our payment requirements under our existing credit facilities our ability to obtain new or additional financing will depend on a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control we may not be able to obtain new or additional financing because we have substantial debt or because we may not have sufficient cash flow to service or repay our existing or future debt in addition depending on market conditions and our financial performance neither debt nor equity financing may be available on satisfactory terms or at all finally as a consequence of worsening financial market conditions our credit facility providers may not provide the agreed credit if they become undercapitalized 

changes in interest rates could adversely affect us 

any period of interest rate increases may adversely affect our profitability at october 31 2020 we had 1105995 of total debt and notes payable outstanding of which 51 percent was priced at interest rates that float with the market a one percentage point increase in the interest rate on the floating rate debt in 2020 would have resulted in approximately 6535 of additional interest expense a higher level of floating rate debt would increase the exposure to changes in interest rates for additional detail related to this risk see part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk additionally the interest rates on some of our debt is tied to libor in july 2017 the head of the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority announced its intention to phase out the use of libor by the end of 2023 the uncertainty regarding the future of libor as well as the transition from libor to another benchmark rate or rates could have adverse impacts on our outstanding debt and notes payable that currently use libor as a benchmark rate and ultimately adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

general risk factors 

the insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures 

we maintain property business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered we are potentially at risk if one or more of our insurance carriers fail additionally severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the ratings and survival of some insurers in the future we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain

our business and operating results may be adversely affected by natural disasters or other catastrophic events beyond our control 

while we have taken precautions to prevent production and service interruptions at our global facilities severe weather conditions such as hurricanes or tornadoes as well as major earthquakes wildfires and other natural disasters as well as cyberterrorism in areas in which we have manufacturing facilities or from which we obtain products may cause physical damage to our properties closure of one or more of our manufacturing or distribution facilities lack of an adequate work force in a market temporary disruption in the supply of inventory disruption in the transport of products and utilities and delays in the delivery of products to our customers any of these factors may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses on an ongoing basis we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that are used to prepare financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates used by management 

certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below on a regular basis critical accounting policies are reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 

revenue recognition – a contract exists when it has approval and commitment from both parties the rights of the parties are identified payment terms are identified the contract has commercial substance and collectability of the consideration is probable revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of the contract with a customer are satisfied generally our revenue results from shortterm fixedprice contracts and is recognized as of a point in time when the product is shipped or at a later point when the control of the product transfers to the customer refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding the companys revenue recognition policy 

business combinations – the acquisitions of our businesses are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting the amounts assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions are based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition with the remainder if any recorded as goodwill the fair values are determined by management taking into consideration information supplied by the management of the acquired entities and other relevant information such information typically includes valuations obtained from independent appraisal experts which management reviews and considers in its estimates of fair values the valuations are generally based upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets discounted to present value the determination of fair values requires significant judgment by management particularly with respect to the value of identifiable intangible assets this judgment could result in either a higher or lower value assigned to amortizable or depreciable assets the impact could result in either higher or lower amortization andor depreciation expense 

goodwill – goodwill is the excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in various business combinations goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level or more often if indications of impairment exist our reporting units are one level below the industrial precision solutions segment and one level below the advanced technology solutions segment 

we test goodwill in accordance with accounting standards codification asc 350 goodwill impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in the quantitative analysis described below we did not record any goodwill impairment charges in 2020 we use an independent valuation specialist to assist with refining our assumptions and methods used to determine fair values using these methods to test for goodwill impairment we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units using a combination of the income approach and the market approach 

the discounted cash flow method income approach uses assumptions for revenue growth operating margin and working capital turnover that are based on management’s strategic plans tempered by performance trends and reasonable expectations about those trends terminal value calculations employ a published formula known as the gordon growth model method that essentially captures the present value of perpetual cash flows beyond the last projected period assuming a constant weighted average cost of capital wacc methodology and growth rate for each reporting unit a sensitivity analysis is performed to vary the discount and terminal growth rates in order to provide a range of reasonableness for detecting impairment discount rates are developed using a wacc methodology the wacc represents the blended average required rate of return for equity and debt capital based on observed market return data and company specific risk factors for 2020 the discount rates used ranged from 70 percent to 88 percent depending upon the reporting units size end market volatility and projection risk 

nordson corporation 25 

table of co ntents 

in the application of the guideline public company method market approach fair value is determined using transactional evidence for similar publicly traded equity the comparable company guideline group is determined based on relative similarities to each reporting unit since exact correlations are not available an indication of fair value for each reporting unit is based on the placement of each reporting unit within a range of multiples determined for its comparable guideline company group valuation multiples are derived by dividing latest twelvemonth performance for revenues and ebitda into total invested capital which is the sum of traded equity plus interest bearing debt less cash these multiples are applied against the revenue and ebitda of each reporting unit while the implied indications of fair value using the guideline public company method yield meaningful results the discounted cash flow method of the income approach includes management’s thoughtful projections and insights as to what the reporting units will accomplish in the near future accordingly the reasonable implied fair value of each reporting unit is a blend based on the consideration of both the income and market approaches 

in 2020 2019 and 2018 the results of our annual impairment tests indicated no impairment 

the excess of fair value fv over carrying value cv was compared to the carrying value for each reporting unit based on the results shown in the table below and based on our measurement date of august 1 2020 our conclusion is that no goodwill was impaired in 2020 potential events or circumstances such as a sustained downturn in global economies could have a negative effect on estimated fair values 



pension plans and postretirement medical plans  the measurement of liabilities related to our pension plans and postretirement medical plans is based on management’s assumptions related to future factors including interest rates return on pension plan assets compensation increases mortality and turnover assumptions and health care cost trend rates 

the weightedaverage discount rate used to determine the present value of our domestic pension plan obligations was 285 percent at october 31 2020 and 325 percent at october 31 2019 the weightedaverage discount rate used to determine the present value of our various international pension plan obligations was 101 percent at october 31 2020 compared to 126 percent at october 31 2019 the discount rates used for all plans were determined by using quality fixed income investments with a duration period approximately equal to the period over which pension obligations are expected to be settled 

in determining the expected return on plan assets we consider both historical performance and an estimate of future longterm rates of return on assets similar to those in our plans we consult with and consider the opinions of financial and actuarial experts in developing appropriate return assumptions the expected rate of return longterm investment rate on domestic pension assets used to determine net benefit costs was 575 percent in 2020 and 600 percent in 2019 the average expected rate of return on international pension assets used to determine net benefit costs was 322 percent in 2020 and 396 percent in 2019 

the assumed rate of compensation increases used to determine the present value of our domestic pension plan obligations was 400 percent at both october 31 2020 and october 31 2019 the assumed rate of compensation increases used to determine the present value of our international pension plan obligations was 269 percent at october 31 2020 compared to 312 percent at october 31 2019 

annual expense amounts are determined based on the discount rate used at the end of the prior year differences between actual and assumed investment returns on pension plan assets result in actuarial gains or losses that are amortized into expense over a period of years 

economic assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported the effect of a one percent change in the discount rate expected return on assets and compensation increase is shown in the table below bracketed numbers represent decreases in expense and obligation amounts 

nordson corporation 26 

table of co ntents 



with respect to the domestic postretirement medical plan the discount rate used to value the benefit obligation was 284 percent at october 31 2020 and 327 percent at october 31 2019 the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the health care cost trend rate is assumed to be 340 percent in 2021 decreasing gradually to 317 percent by 2026 

for the international postretirement medical plan the discount rate used to value the benefit obligation was 294 percent at october 31 2020 and 303 percent at october 31 2019 the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the health care cost trend rate is assumed to be 422 percent in 2021 to 405 percent by 2040 

the discount rate and the health care cost trend rate assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported for example a onepercentage point change in the discount rate and the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects bracketed numbers represent decreases in expense and obligation amounts 



employees hired after january 1 2002 are not eligible to participate in the domestic postretirement medical plan 

pension and postretirement expenses in 2021 are expected to be approximately 5500 lower than 2020 

income taxes – income taxes are estimated based on income for financial reporting purposes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes and certain changes in valuation allowances we provide valuation allowances against deferred tax assets if based on available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

management believes the valuation allowances are adequate after considering future taxable income allowable carryforward periods and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize the deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount including the valuation allowance an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made conversely should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be expensed in the period such determination was made 

further at each interim reporting period we estimate an effective income tax rate that is expected to be applicable for the full year significant judgment is involved regarding the application of global income tax laws and regulations and when projecting the jurisdictional mix of income additionally interpretation of tax laws court decisions or other guidance provided by taxing authorities influences our estimate of the effective income tax rates as a result our actual effective income tax rates and related income tax liabilities may differ materially from our estimated effective tax rates and related income tax liabilities any resulting differences are recorded in the period they become known

we had two acquisitions during 2020 fluortek inc and vivamos ltd which are both included within the advanced technology solutions segment refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion as used throughout this form 10k geographic regions include the americas canada mexico and central and south america asia pacific excluding japan europe japan and the united states 

worldwide sales for 2020 were 2121100 a decrease of 33 percent from 2019 sales of 2194226 the decrease consisted of a 37 percent decline in sales volume and unfavorable currency translation effects which decreased sales by 02 percent partially offset by 06 percent growth from acquisitions

selling and administrative expenses were 693552 in 2020 compared to 708990 in 2019 of the 22 percent decrease lower base business costs contributed 37 percentage points and favorable currency translation effects contributed 02 of a percentage point these improvements were partially offset by 10 percentage point due to higher severance costs and 07 of a percentage point due to the first year effect of acquisitions 

selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 327 percent in 2020 from 323 percent in 2019 of the 04 percentage point increase higher severance costs contributed 05 of a percentage point and the first year effect of acquisitions contributed 01 of a percentage point these increases were partially offset by lower base business costs of 02 of a percentage point 

in the fourth quarter of 2020 we committed to a plan to sell our screws and barrels product line within the adhesives reporting unit under our industrial precision solutions segment and determined that it met the criteria to be classified as held for sale the decision was part of a strategy to focus resources on core strategies and businesses and the board of directors authorized the disposition on october 23 2020 as a result of this decision the company incurred a noncash assets held for sale impairment charge of 87371 refer to note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

operating profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 165 percent in 2020 compared to 220 percent in 2019 of the 55 percentage point decline in operating margin the assets held for sale impairment charge contributed 41 percentage points unfavorable absorption due to lower sales volume and unfavorable product mix contributed 08 of a percentage point higher severance costs contributed 05 of a percentage point and the amortization of the stepup of acquired inventory unfavorable foreign currency translation effects and the firstyear effect of acquisitions combined to contribute a negative impact of 03 of a percentage point  this decline was partially offset by 02 of a percentage point due to lower base business costs 

operating capacity for each of our segments can support fluctuations in order activity without significant changes in operating costs also currency translation affects reported operating margins operating margins for each segment were unfavorably impacted by a stronger dollar primarily against the chinese yuan mexican peso and brazilian real during 2020 as compared to 2019 

interest expense in 2020 was 32160 a decrease of 14985 or 318 percent from 2019  the decrease was due to lower average debt levels and lower variable interest rates compared to the prior year other expense in 2020 was 17577 compared to other expense of 6708 in 2019  included in the current year’s other expense were pension costs of 13683 and 1532 in foreign currency losses included in the prior year’s other expense were pension costs of 7136 the increased pension costs were principally attributable to increased amortization of net actuarial losses

effects of foreign currency 

the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on sales and operating results cannot be precisely measured due to fluctuating selling prices sales volume product mix and cost structures in each country where we operate as a general rule a weakening of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies has a favorable effect on sales and net income while a strengthening of the dollar has a detrimental effect 

in 2020 as compared with 2019 the united states dollar was generally stronger against foreign currencies if 2019 exchange rates had been in effect during 2020 sales would have been approximately 5400 higher and third party costs would have been approximately 1200 higher in 2019 as compared with 2018 the united states dollar was generally stronger against foreign currencies if 2018 exchange rates had been in effect during 2019 sales would have been approximately 45600 higher and thirdparty costs would have been approximately 23500 higher these effects on reported sales do not include the impact of local price adjustments made in response to changes in currency exchange rates

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we operate internationally and enter into intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies consequently we are subject to market risk arising from exchange rate movements between the dates foreign currencies are recorded and the dates they are settled we regularly use foreign exchange contracts to reduce our risks related to most of these transactions these contracts primarily associated with the euro yen and pound sterling typically have maturities of 90 days or less and generally require the exchange of foreign currencies for united states dollars at rates stated in the contracts gains and losses from changes in the market value of these contracts offset foreign exchange losses and gains respectively on the underlying transactions other transactions denominated in foreign currencies are designated as hedges of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries or are intercompany transactions of a longterm investment nature we use foreign exchange contracts on a routine basis to help mitigate the risks related to transactions denominated in foreign currencies 

refer to note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion about our foreign currency transactions and the methods and assumptions used to record these transactions 

a portion of our operations is financed with shortterm and longterm borrowings and is subject to market risk arising from changes in interest rates

we also have variablerate notes payable and longterm debt the weighted average interest rate of this variablerate debt was 076 percent at october 31 2020 and 30 percent at october 31 2019 a one percent increase in interest rates would have resulted in additional interest expense of approximately 6535 on the variable rate notes payable and longterm debt in 2020

principal materials used to make our products are metals and plastics typically in sheets bar stock castings forgings tubing and pellets we also purchase many electrical and electronic components fabricated metal parts highpressure fluid hoses packings seals and other items integral to our products suppliers are competitively selected based on cost quality and service all significant raw materials that we use are available through multiple sources we purchase most raw materials and other components on the open market and rely on third parties to provide certain finished goods while these items are generally available from multiple sources the cost of products sold may be affected by changes in the market price of raw materials and tariffs on certain raw materials particularly imports from china as well as disruptions in availability of raw materials components and sourced finished goods 

we monitor and investigate alternative suppliers and materials based on numerous attributes including quality service and price we currently source raw materials and components from a number of suppliers but our ongoing efforts to improve the cost effectiveness of our products and services may result in a reduction in the number of our suppliers 

senior operating management supervises an extensive quality control program for our equipment machinery and systems and manufacturing processes

natural gas and other fuels are our primary energy sources however standby capacity for alternative sources is available if needed




 item 1a risk factors

in an enterprise as diverse as ours a wide range of factors could affect future performance we discuss in this section some of the risk factors that if they actually occurred could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition value and results of operations you should consider these risk factors in connection with evaluating the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k because these factors could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected in forwardlooking statements

the significant risk factors affecting our operations include the following

changes in united states or international economic conditions including declines in the industries we serve could adversely affect the profitability of any of our operations

in 2019 approximately 35 percent of our revenue was generated in the united states while approximately 65 percent was generated outside the united states a general slowdown in the global economy or in a particular region or industry or an increase in trade tensions with us trading partners could negatively impact our business financial condition or liquidity our largest markets include consumer nondurable industrial medical electronics consumer durable and automotive a slowdown in any of these specific end markets could directly affect our revenue stream and profitability

a portion of our product sales is attributable to industries and markets such as the electronics polymer processing and metal finishing industries which historically have been cyclical and sensitive to relative changes in supply and demand and general economic conditions the demand for our products depends in part on the general economic conditions of the industries or national economies of our customers downward economic cycles in our customers’ industries or countries may reduce sales of some of our products it is not possible to predict accurately the factors that will affect demand for our products in the future

any significant downturn in the health of the general economy globally regionally or in the markets in which we sell products could have an adverse effect on our revenues and financial performance resulting in impairment of assets we cannot predict the timing strength or duration of any economic slowdown instability or recovery generally or within any particular region or industry in which we operate 

nordson corporation 9 

 

if we fail to develop new products or enhance existing products  or our customers do not accept the new or enhanced products we develop our revenue and profitability could be adversely impacted 

innovation is critical to our success we believe that we must continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and manufacture new products with improved capabilities in order to continue to be a leading provider of precision technology solutions we also believe that we must continue to make improvements in our productivity in order to maintain our competitive position difficulties or delays in research development or production of new or enhanced products or failure to gain market acceptance of new or enhanced products and technologies may reduce future sales and adversely affect our competitive position we continue to invest in the development and marketing of new or enhanced products there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses if we fail to make innovations launch products with quality problems or the market does not accept our new products our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected in addition as new or enhanced products are introduced we must successfully manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption in customers’ ordering patterns avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that we can deliver sufficient supplies of new products to meet customers’ demands

increased it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems networks products solutions and services

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience cyberattacks to our systems and networks to date we have not experienced any material breaches or material losses related to cyberattacks to conduct our business we rely extensively on information technology systems networks and services some of which are managed hosted and provided by thirdparty service providers increased global it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and those of our thirdparty service providers and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data depending on their nature and scope such threats could potentially lead to the compromising of confidential information including but not limited to confidential information relating to customer or employee data improper use of our systems and networks manipulation and destruction of data defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions which in turn could adversely affect our reputation competitiveness and results of operations a cyberattack or other disruption may also result in financial loss including potential fines for failure to safeguard data or losses in connection with any litigation that may result from a cyberattack our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs arising from such events 

we have taken steps and incurred costs to further strengthen the security of our computer systems and continue to assess maintain and enhance the ongoing effectiveness of our information security systems while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including employee training comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems our systems networks products solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats the techniques used by criminals to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive data change frequently and often are not recognizable until launched against a target accordingly we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures it is therefore possible that in the future we may suffer a criminal attack unauthorized parties may gain access to personal information in our possession and we may not be able to identify any such incident in a timely manner 

 

the interpretation and application of data protection laws including federal state and international laws relating to the collection use retention disclosure security and transfer of personally identifiable data in the us europe including but not limited to the european union’s general data protection regulation and elsewhere are uncertain and evolving it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices in addition as a result of existing or new data protection requirements we incur and expect to continue to incur significant ongoing operating costs as part of our significant efforts to protect and safeguard our sensitive data and personal information these efforts also may divert management and employee attention from other business and growth initiatives a breach in information privacy could result in legal or reputational risks and could have a negative impact on our revenues and results of operations

 

our results have been and could continue to be impacted by uncertainty in us trade policy including uncertainty surrounding changes in tariffs trade agreements or other trade restrictions imposed by the us or other governments

our ability to conduct business can be significantly impacted by changes in tariffs changes or repeals of trade agreements including withdrawal from or material modifications to the north american free trade agreement which the us government has renegotiated into the “united statesmexicocanada agreement” with mexico and canada and has yet to ratify or the imposition of other trade restrictions or retaliatory actions imposed by various governments other effects of these changes including impacts on the price of raw materials responsive actions from governments and the opportunity for competitors to establish a presence in markets where we participate could also have significant impacts on our results we cannot predict what further action may be taken with respect to tariffs or trade relations between the us and other governments and any further changes in us or international trade policy could have an adverse impact on our business 

nordson corporation 10 

 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions and we may not be able to execute on our acquisition strategy or integrate acquisitions successfully 

our recent historical growth has depended and our future growth is likely to continue to depend in part on our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses into our existing operations we intend to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world we cannot assure we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition opportunities prevail against competing potential acquirers negotiate appropriate acquisition terms obtain financing that may be needed to consummate such acquisitions complete proposed acquisitions successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new markets in addition we cannot assure that any acquisition once successfully integrated will perform as planned be accretive to earnings or prove to be beneficial to our operations and cash flow

the success of our acquisition strategy is subject to other risks and uncertainties including















in addition an acquisition could adversely impact our operating performance as a result of the incurrence of acquisitionrelated debt preacquisition potential tax liabilities acquisition expenses the amortization of acquisitionacquired assets or possible future impairments of goodwill or intangible assets associated with the acquisition

we may also face liability with respect to acquired businesses for violations of environmental laws occurring prior to the date of our acquisition and some or all of these liabilities may not be covered by environmental insurance secured to mitigate the risk or by indemnification from the sellers from which we acquired these businesses we could also incur significant costs including but not limited to remediation costs natural resources damages civil or criminal fines and sanctions and thirdparty claims as a result of past or future violations of or liabilities associated with environmental laws

significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates or change in monetary policy may harm our financial results

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly with respect to the euro the yen the pound sterling and the chinese yuan any significant change in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business against the united states dollar could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for additional detail related to this risk see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk

a significant portion of our consolidated revenues in 2019 were generated in currencies other than the united states dollar which is our reporting currency we recognize foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from our operations in the period incurred as a result currency fluctuations between the united states dollar and the currencies in which we do business have caused and will continue to cause foreign currency transaction and translation gains and losses which historically have been material and could continue to be material we cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future operating results because of the number of currencies involved the variability of currency exposures and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates we take actions to manage our foreign currency exposure such as entering into hedging transactions where available but we cannot assure that our strategies will adequately protect our consolidated operating results from the effects of exchange rate fluctuations for example uncertainty surrounding the effects and timing of brexit have caused increased volatility in global currency exchange rates that have resulted in the strengthening of the united states dollar against the foreign currencies in which we conduct business future adverse consequences arising from brexit may include continued volatility in exchange rates any significant fluctuation in exchange rates may be harmful to our financial condition and results of operations we also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into united states dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or customers located in or conducting business in a country imposing controls currency devaluations diminish the united states dollar value of the currency of the country instituting the devaluation and if they occur or continue for significant periods could adversely affect our earnings or cash flow

nordson corporation 11 

 

any impairment in the value of our intangible assets including goodwill would negatively affect our operating results and total capitalization 

our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets primarily goodwill the goodwill results from our acquisitions and represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the identifiable net assets we acquired we assess at least annually whether there has been any impairment in the value of our intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels if competing or alternative technologies emerge if market conditions for acquired businesses decline if significant and prolonged negative industry or economic trends exist if our stock price and market capitalization declines or if future cash flow estimates decline we could incur under current applicable accounting rules a noncash charge to operating earnings for goodwill impairment any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and equity book value the effect of which could be material

changes in united states and international tax law may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions changes in applicable domestic or foreign tax laws and regulations or their interpretation and application including the possibility of retroactive effect could affect our business financial condition and profitability by increasing our tax liabilities our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in our effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates changes in our overall profitability changes in tax legislation and rates changes in generally accepted accounting principles and changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the us federal government may adopt changes to international trade agreements tariffs taxes and other government rules and regulations while we cannot predict what changes will actually occur with respect to any of these items such changes could affect our business and results of operations

if our intellectual property protection is inadequate others may be able to use our technologies and tradenames and thereby reduce our ability to compete which could have a material adverse effect on us our financial condition and results of operations

we regard much of the technology underlying our products and the trademarks under which we market our products as proprietary the steps we take to protect our proprietary technology may be inadequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or third parties may independently develop similar technology we rely on a combination of patents trademark copyright and trade secret laws employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and other contracts to establish and protect our technology and other intellectual property rights the agreements may be breached or terminated and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach and existing trade secrets patent and copyright law afford us limited protection policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult a third party could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization litigation may be necessary for us to defend against claims of infringement or to protect our intellectual property rights and could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our efforts further we might not prevail in such litigation which could harm our business

our products could infringe on the intellectual property of others which may cause us to engage in costly litigation and if we are not successful could cause us to pay substantial damages and prohibit us from selling our products

third parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us based on their patents or other intellectual property claims and we may have to pay substantial damages possibly including treble damages if it is ultimately determined our products infringe we may have to obtain a license to sell our products if it is determined that our products infringe upon another party’s intellectual property we might be prohibited from selling our products before we obtain a license which if available at all may require us to pay substantial royalties even if infringement claims against us are without merit defending these types of lawsuits takes significant time may be expensive and may divert management attention from other business concerns

we may be exposed to liabilities under the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa which could have a material adverse effect on our business

we are subject to compliance with various laws and regulations including the fcpa and similar worldwide antibribery and anticorruption laws which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or making other improper payments to private or public parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining an unfair business advantage the fcpa also requires proper record keeping and characterization of such payments in our reports filed with the sec our employees are trained and required to comply with these laws and we are committed to legal compliance and corporate ethics violations of these laws could result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and financial penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition or results of operations 

nordson corporation 12 

 

our inability to comply with our existing credit facilities’ restrictive covenants or to access additional sources of capital could impede growth or the repayment or refinancing of existing indebtedness 

the limits imposed on us by the restrictive covenants contained in our credit facilities could prevent us from making acquisitions or cause us to lose access to these facilities

our existing credit facilities contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to among other things









in addition our credit facilities require us to meet financial ratios including a “leverage ratio” and an “interest coverage ratio” both as defined in the credit facilities

these restrictions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs and could otherwise restrict our financing activities

our ability to comply with the covenants and other terms of our credit facilities will depend on our future operating performance if we fail to comply with such covenants and terms we may be in default and the maturity of the related debt could be accelerated and become immediately due and payable we may be required to obtain waivers from our lenders in order to maintain compliance under our credit facilities including waivers with respect to our compliance with certain financial covenants if we are unable to obtain necessary waivers and the debt under our credit facilities is accelerated we would be required to obtain replacement financing at prevailing market rates

we may need new or additional financing in the future to expand our business or refinance existing indebtedness if we are unable to access capital on satisfactory terms and conditions we may not be able to expand our business or meet our payment requirements under our existing credit facilities our ability to obtain new or additional financing will depend on a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control we may not be able to obtain new or additional financing because we have substantial debt or because we may not have sufficient cash flow to service or repay our existing or future debt in addition depending on market conditions and our financial performance neither debt nor equity financing may be available on satisfactory terms or at all finally as a consequence of worsening financial market conditions our credit facility providers may not provide the agreed credit if they become undercapitalized

changes in interest rates could adversely affect us

any period of interest rate increases may adversely affect our profitability at october 31 2019 we had 1244142 of total debt and notes payable outstanding of which 51 percent was priced at interest rates that float with the market a one percentage point increase in the interest rate on the floating rate debt in 2019 would have resulted in approximately 7236 of additional interest expense a higher level of floating rate debt would increase the exposure to changes in interest rates for additional detail related to this risk see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk additionally the interest rates on some of our debt is tied to libor in july 2017 the head of the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority announced its intention to phase out the use of libor by the end of 2021 the uncertainty regarding the future of libor as well as the transition from libor to another benchmark rate or rates could have adverse impacts on our outstanding debt and notes payable that currently use libor as a benchmark rate and ultimately adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

failure to retain our existing senior management team or the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could hurt our business and inhibit our ability to operate and grow successfully

during 2019 we experienced a leadership change with the appointment of a new president and chief executive officer our success will continue to depend to a significant extent on the continued service of our executive management team and the ability to recruit hire and retain other key management personnel to support our growth and operational initiatives and replace executives who retire or resign failure to retain our leadership team and attract and retain other important management and technical personnel could place a constraint on our global growth and operational initiatives possibly resulting in inefficient and ineffective management and operations which would likely harm our revenues operations and product development efforts and eventually result in a decrease in profitability

nordson corporation 13 

 

the level of returns on pension plan assets and changes in the actuarial assumptions used could adversely affect us 

our operating results may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of expense we record for our defined benefit pension plans us gaap requires that we calculate pension expense using actuarial valuations which are dependent upon our various assumptions including estimates of expected longterm rate of return on plan assets discount rates for future payment obligations and the expected rate of increase in future compensation levels our pension expense and funding requirements may also be affected by our actual return on plan assets and by legislation and other government regulatory actions changes in assumptions laws or regulations could lead to variability in operating results and could have a material adverse impact on liquidity

political conditions in the us and foreign countries in which we operate could adversely affect us

we conduct our manufacturing sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and are subject to risks associated with doing business outside the united states in 2019 approximately 65 percent of our total sales were generated outside the united states we expect that international operations and united states export sales will continue to be important to our business for the foreseeable future both sales from international operations and export sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside the united states such risks include but are not limited to the following



















any of these events could reduce the demand for our products limit the prices at which we can sell our products interrupt our supply chain or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operating performance

our international operations also depend upon favorable trade relations between the us and those foreign countries in which our customers subcontractors and materials suppliers have operations a protectionist trade environment in either the us or those foreign countries in which we do business such as a change in the current tariff structures export compliance or other trade policies may materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our products in foreign markets the current us presidential administration has criticized existing trade agreements and while it remains unclear what actions the administration may take with respect to existing and proposed trade agreements or restrictions on trade generally more stringent export and import controls may be ultimately imposed in the future

our business and operating results may be adversely affected by natural disasters or other catastrophic events beyond our control

while we have taken precautions to prevent production and service interruptions at our global facilities severe weather conditions such as hurricanes or tornadoes as well as major earthquakes wildfires and other natural disasters as well as cyberterrorism in areas in which we have manufacturing facilities or from which we obtain products may cause physical damage to our properties closure of one or more of our manufacturing or distribution facilities lack of an adequate work force in a market temporary disruption in the supply of inventory disruption in the transport of products and utilities and delays in the delivery of products to our customers any of these factors may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

nordson corporation 14 

 

the insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures 

we maintain property business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered we are potentially at risk if one or more of our insurance carriers fail additionally severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the ratings and survival of some insurers in the future we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are involved in pending or potential litigation regarding environmental product liability patent contract employee and other matters arising from the normal course of business including the litigation and environmental matters discussed below after consultation with legal counsel we do not believe that losses in excess of the amounts we have accrued would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition quarterly or annual operating results or cash flows

class action litigation 

on february 22 2019 a former employee mr ortiz filed a purported class action lawsuit in the san diego county superior court california against nordson asymtek inc and nordson corporation alleging various violations of the california labor code plaintiff seeks among other things an unspecified amount for unpaid wages actual consequential and incidental losses penalties and attorneys’ fees and costs management believes based on currently available information that the ultimate outcome of the proceeding described above will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations 

environmental 

we have voluntarily agreed with the city of new richmond wisconsin and other potentially responsible parties to share costs associated with the remediation of the city of new richmond municipal landfill the “site” and constructing a potable water delivery system serving the impacted area down gradient of the site at october 31 2019 and 2018 our accrual for the ongoing operation maintenance and monitoring obligation at the site was 401 and 439 respectively

the liability for environmental remediation represents management’s best estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable undiscounted costs related to known remediation obligations the accuracy of our estimate of environmental liability is affected by several uncertainties such as additional requirements that may be identified in connection with remedial activities the complexity and evolution of environmental laws and regulations and the identification of presently unknown remediation requirements consequently our liability could be different than our current estimate however we do not expect that the costs associated with remediation will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

unless otherwise noted all references to years relate to our fiscal year ending october 31

critical accounting policies and estimates

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses on an ongoing basis we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that are used to prepare financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates used by management

certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below on a regular basis critical accounting policies are reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors

revenue recognition – a contract exists when it has approval and commitment from both parties the rights of the parties are identified payment terms are identified the contract has commercial substance and collectability of the consideration is probable revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of the contract with a customer are satisfied generally our revenue results from shortterm fixedprice contracts and is recognized as of a point in time when the product is shipped or at a later point when the control of the product transfers to the customer refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion around the companys revenue recognition policy 

business combinations – the acquisitions of our businesses are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting the amounts assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions are based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition with the remainder if any recorded as goodwill the fair values are determined by management taking into consideration information supplied by the management of the acquired entities and other relevant information such information typically includes valuations obtained from independent appraisal experts which management reviews and considers in its estimates of fair values the valuations are generally based upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets discounted to present value the determination of fair values requires significant judgment by management particularly with respect to the value of identifiable intangible assets this judgment could result in either a higher or lower value assigned to amortizable or depreciable assets the impact could result in either higher or lower amortization andor depreciation expense 

goodwill – goodwill is the excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in various business combinations goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level or more often if indications of impairment exist our reporting units are the adhesive dispensing systems segment the industrial coating systems segment and one level below the advanced technology systems segment 

we test goodwill in accordance with accounting standards codification asc 350 goodwill impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in the quantitative analysis described below we did not record any goodwill impairment charges in 2019 we use an independent valuation specialist to assist with refining our assumptions and methods used to determine fair values using these methods to test for goodwill impairment we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units using a combination of the income approach and the market approach 

the discounted cash flow method income approach uses assumptions for revenue growth operating margin and working capital turnover that are based on management’s strategic plans tempered by performance trends and reasonable expectations about those trends terminal value calculations employ a published formula known as the gordon growth model method that essentially captures the present value of perpetual cash flows beyond the last projected period assuming a constant weighted average cost of capital wacc methodology and growth rate for each reporting unit a sensitivity analysis is performed to vary the discount and terminal growth rates in order to provide a range of reasonableness for detecting impairment discount rates are developed using a wacc methodology the wacc represents the blended average required rate of return for equity and debt capital based on observed market return data and company specific risk factors for 2019 the discount rates used ranged from 9 percent to 12 percent depending upon the reporting units size end market volatility and projection risk

in the application of the guideline public company method market approach fair value is determined using transactional evidence for similar publicly traded equity the comparable company guideline group is determined based on relative similarities to each reporting unit since exact correlations are not available an indication of fair value for each reporting unit is based on the placement of each reporting unit within a range of multiples determined for its comparable guideline company group valuation multiples are derived by dividing latest twelvemonth performance for revenues and ebitda into total invested capital which is the sum of traded equity plus interest bearing debt less cash these multiples are applied against the revenue and ebitda of each reporting unit while the implied indications of fair value using the guideline public company method yield meaningful results the discounted cash flow method of the income approach includes management’s thoughtful projections and insights as to what the reporting units will accomplish in the near future accordingly the reasonable implied fair value of each reporting unit is a blend based on the consideration of both the income and market approaches 

in 2019 2018 and 2017 the results of our annual impairment tests indicated no impairment

the excess of fair value fv over carrying value cv was compared to the carrying value for each reporting unit based on the results shown in the table below and based on our measurement date of august 1 2019 our conclusion is that no goodwill was impaired in 2019 potential events or circumstances such as a sustained downturn in global economies could have a negative effect on estimated fair values

 



 

pension plans and postretirement medical plans  the measurement of liabilities related to our pension plans and postretirement medical plans is based on management’s assumptions related to future factors including interest rates return on pension plan assets compensation increases mortality and turnover assumptions and health care cost trend rates 

the weightedaverage discount rate used to determine the present value of our domestic pension plan obligations was 325 percent at october 31 2019 and 453 percent at october 31 2018 the weightedaverage discount rate used to determine the present value of our various international pension plan obligations was 126 percent at october 31 2019 compared to 214 percent at october 31 2018 the discount rates used for all plans were determined by using quality fixed income investments with a duration period approximately equal to the period over which pension obligations are expected to be settled

in determining the expected return on plan assets we consider both historical performance and an estimate of future longterm rates of return on assets similar to those in our plans we consult with and consider the opinions of financial and actuarial experts in developing appropriate return assumptions the expected rate of return longterm investment rate on domestic pension assets used to determine net benefit costs was 600 percent in both 2019 and 2018 the average expected rate of return on international pension assets used to determine net benefit costs was 396 percent in 2019 and 391 percent in 2018

the assumed rate of compensation increases used to determine the present value of our domestic pension plan obligations was 400 percent at october 31 2019 compared to 390 percent at october 31 2018 the assumed rate of compensation increases used to determine the present value of our international pension plan obligations was 312 percent at both october 31 2019 and october 31 2018

annual expense amounts are determined based on the discount rate used at the end of the prior year differences between actual and assumed investment returns on pension plan assets result in actuarial gains or losses that are amortized into expense over a period of years

nordson corporation 22 

 

economic assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported the effect of a one percent change in the discount rate expected return on assets and compensation increase is shown in the table below bracketed numbers represent decreases in expense and obligation amounts 

 



 

with respect to the domestic postretirement medical plan the discount rate used to value the benefit obligation was 327 percent at october 31 2019 and 456 percent at october 31 2018 the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the health care cost trend rate is assumed to be 362 percent in 2020 decreasing gradually to 324 percent in 2026

for the international postretirement plan the discount rate used to value the benefit obligation was 303 percent at october 31 2019 and 388 percent at october 31 2018 the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the health care cost trend rate is assumed to be 400 percent in 2020 to 405 percent in 2040 

the discount rate and the health care cost trend rate assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported for example a onepercentage point change in the discount rate and the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects bracketed numbers represent decreases in expense and obligation amounts

 



 

employees hired after january 1 2002 are not eligible to participate in the domestic postretirement medical plan 

pension and postretirement expenses in 2020 are expected to be approximately 9900 higher than 2019

income taxes – income taxes are estimated based on income for financial reporting purposes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes and certain changes in valuation allowances we provide valuation allowances against deferred tax assets if based on available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

nordson corporation 23 

 

management believes the valuation allowances are adequate after considering future taxable income allowable carryforward periods and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize the deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount including the valuation allowance an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made conversely should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be expensed in the period such determination was made 

further at each interim reporting period we estimate an effective income tax rate that is expected to be applicable for the full year significant judgment is involved regarding the application of global income tax laws and regulations and when projecting the jurisdictional mix of income additionally interpretation of tax laws court decisions or other guidance provided by taxing authorities influences our estimate of the effective income tax rates as a result our actual effective income tax rates and related income tax liabilities may differ materially from our estimated effective tax rates and related income tax liabilities any resulting differences are recorded in the period they become known

refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion







we believe that the combination of present capital resources cash from operations and unused financing sources are more than adequate to meet cash requirements for 2020 there are no significant restrictions limiting the transfer of funds from international subsidiaries to the parent company

outlook

our operating performance balance sheet position and financial ratios for 2019 remained strong although uncertainties persist in global financial markets and the general economic environment going forward we are wellpositioned to manage our liquidity needs that arise from working capital requirements capital expenditures and contributions related to pension and postretirement obligations as well as principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt primary sources of capital to meet these needs as well as other opportunistic investments are a combination of cash provided by operations and borrowings under our loan agreements in 2019 cash from operations was 17 percent of revenue with respect to borrowings as of october 31 2019 we had full available capacity under our fiveyear term 850000 unsecured multicurrency credit facility this credit facility expires in february 2024 

respective to all of these loans are two primary covenants the leverage ratio that generally restricts indebtedness net of cash to a maximum 375 times consolidated fourquarter trailing ebitda and the interest coverage ratio that requires fourquarter trailing ebitda to be a minimum of 25 times consolidated trailing fourquarter interest expense debt ebitda and interest expense are as defined in the respective credit agreements

 

we are optimistic about our longerterm growth opportunities in the diverse consumer nondurable industrial medical electronics consumer durable and automotive end markets we serve we also support our customers with parts and consumables so a significant percentage of our revenue is recurring for 2020 organic sales are expected to increase 1 to 3 percent compared to the prior year offset by an unfavorable currency effect of less than 1 percent based on the current exchange rate environment as compared to the prior year based on this 2020 sales outlook we are forecasting earnings per share growth of 2 percent to 6 percent compared to the prior year

 

we move forward with caution given the potential for a lowergrowth macroeconomic environment continued trade negotiations and the marketplace effects of political instability in certain areas of the world though the status of the global economy remains unclear our growth potential has been demonstrated over time through our ability to build and enhance our core businesses by entering emerging markets pursuing market adjacencies and driving growth initiatives we drive value for our customers through our application expertise differentiated technology and direct sales and service support our priorities also are focused on operational efficiencies by employing continuous improvement methodologies in our business processes we expect our efforts will continue to provide more than sufficient cash from operations to meet our liquidity needs pay dividends to common shareholders and enable us to invest in the development of new applications and markets for our technologies we intend to focus capital expenditures in 2020 on continued investments in our information systems and projects that improve both the capacity and efficiency of manufacturing and distribution operations cash from operations has been 16 to 22 percent of revenues over the past five years which when combined with our available borrowing capacity and ready access to capital markets is more than adequate to fund our liquidity needs over the next year

effects of foreign currency

the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on sales and operating results cannot be precisely measured due to fluctuating selling prices sales volume product mix and cost structures in each country where we operate as a general rule a weakening of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies has a favorable effect on sales and net income while a strengthening of the dollar has a detrimental effect

in 2019 as compared with 2018 the united states dollar was generally stronger against foreign currencies if 2018 exchange rates had been in effect during 2019 sales would have been approximately 45600 higher and third party costs would have been approximately 23500 higher in 2018 as compared with 2017 the united states dollar was generally weaker against foreign currencies if 2017 exchange rates had been in effect during 2018 sales would have been approximately 41800 lower and thirdparty costs would have been approximately 21700 higher these effects on reported sales do not include the impact of local price adjustments made in response to changes in currency exchange rates

inflation

inflation affects profit margins as the ability to pass cost increases on to customers is restricted by the need for competitive pricing although inflation has been modest in recent years and has had no material effect on the years covered by the financial statements included in this report we continue to seek ways to minimize the impact of inflation through focused efforts to increase productivity

trends

the fiveyear summary in item 6 documents our historical financial trends over this period the world’s economic conditions fluctuated significantly our solid performance is attributed to our participation in diverse geographic and industrial markets and our longterm commitment to develop and provide quality products and worldwide service to meet our customers’ changing needs

 item 7a quantitative and qualitat ive disclosures about market risk 

we operate internationally and enter into intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies consequently we are subject to market risk arising from exchange rate movements between the dates foreign currencies are recorded and the dates they are settled we regularly use foreign exchange contracts to reduce our risks related to most of these transactions these contracts primarily associated with the euro yen and pound sterling typically have maturities of 90 days or less and generally require the exchange of foreign currencies for united states dollars at rates stated in the contracts gains and losses from changes in the market value of these contracts offset foreign exchange losses and gains respectively on the underlying transactions other transactions denominated in foreign currencies are designated as hedges of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries or are intercompany transactions of a longterm investment nature as a result of the use of foreign exchange contracts on a routine basis to reduce the risks related to most of our transactions denominated in foreign currencies as of october 31 2019 we did not have material foreign currency exposure

refer to note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion about our foreign currency transactions and the methods and assumptions used to record these transactions

a portion of our operations is financed with shortterm and longterm borrowings and is subject to market risk arising from changes in interest rates

the tables that follow present principal repayments and weightedaverage interest rates on outstanding borrowings of fixedrate debt

 



 

we also have variablerate notes payable and longterm debt the weighted average interest rate of this debt was 30 percent at october 31 2019 and 32 percent at october 31 2018 a one percent increase in interest rates would have resulted in additional interest expense of approximately 7236 on the variable rate notes payable and longterm debt in 2019

our production operations include machining molding and assembly we manufacture specially designed parts and assemble components into finished equipment many components are made in standard modules that can be used in more than one product or in combination with other components for a variety of models we have principal manufacturing operations and sources of supply in the united states in ohio georgia california colorado connecticut illinois massachusetts michigan minnesota new jersey rhode island tennessee and wisconsin as well as in the people’s republic of china germany ireland israel mexico the netherlands thailand and the united kingdom

principal materials used to make our products are metals and plastics typically in sheets bar stock castings forgings tubing and pellets we also purchase many electrical and electronic components fabricated metal parts hi ghpressure fluid hoses packings seals and other items integral to our products suppliers are competitively selected based on cost quality and service all significant raw materials that we use are available through multiple sources we purchase most raw materials and other components on the open market and rely on third parties to provide certain finished goods while these items are generally available from multiple sources the cost of products sold may be affected by changes in the market price of raw materials and tariffs on certain raw materials particularly imports from china as well as disruptions in availability of raw materials components and sourced finished goods

we monitor and investigate alternative suppliers and materials based on numerous attributes including quality service and price we currently source raw materials and components from a number of suppliers but our ongoing efforts to improve the cost effectiveness of our products and services may result in a reduction in the number of our suppliers 

senior operating management supervise an extensive quality control program for our equipment machinery and systems and manufacturing processes

natural gas and other fuels are our primary energy sources however standby capacity for alternative sources is available if needed




 item 1a ri sk factors 

in an enterprise as diverse as ours a wide range of factors could affect future performance we discuss in this section some of the risk factors that if they actually occurred could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition value and results of operations you should consider these risk factors in connection with evaluating the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k because these factors could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected in forwardlooking statements

the significant risk factors affecting our operations include the following

changes in united states or international economic conditions including declines in the industries we serve could adversely affect the profitability of any of our operations

in 2018 approximately 32 percent of our revenue was generated in the united states while approximately 68 percent was generated outside the united states our largest markets include appliance automotive construction container electronics assembly food and beverage furniture medical metal finishing nonwovens packaging paper and paperboard converting plastics processing and semiconductor a slowdown in any of these specific end markets could directly affect our revenue stream and profitability

a portion of our product sales is attributable to industries and markets such as the semiconductor mobile electronics polymer processing and metal finishing industries which historically have been cyclical and sensitive to relative changes in supply and demand and general economic conditions the demand for our products depends in part on the general economic conditions of the industries or national economies of our customers downward economic cycles in our customers’ industries or countries may reduce sales of some of our products it is not possible to predict accurately the factors that will affect demand for our products in the future

any significant downturn in the health of the general economy globally regionally or in the markets in which we sell products could have an adverse effect on our revenues and financial performance resulting in impairment of assets

if we fail to develop new products or our customers do not accept the new products we develop our revenue and profitability could be adversely impacted

innovation is critical to our success we believe that we must continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and manufacture new products with improved capabilities in order to continue to be a leading provider of precision technology solutions for the industrial equipment market we also believe that we must continue to make improvements in our productivity in order to maintain our competitive position difficulties or delays in research development or production of new products or failure to gain market acceptance of new products and technologies may reduce future sales and adversely affect our competitive position we continue to invest in the development and marketing of new products there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses if we fail to make innovations launch products with quality problems or the market does not accept our new products our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected in addition as new or enhanced products are introduced we must successfully manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption in customers’ ordering patterns avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that we can deliver sufficient supplies of new products to meet customers’ demands

increased it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems networks products solutions and services

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience cyberattacks to our systems and networks to date we have not experienced any material breaches or material losses related to cyberattacks to conduct our business we rely extensively on information technology systems networks and services some of which are managed hosted and provided by thirdparty service providers increased global it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and those of our thirdparty service providers and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data depending on their nature and scope such threats could potentially lead to the compromising of confidential information including but not limited to confidential information relating to customer or employee data improper use of our systems and networks manipulation and destruction of data defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions which in turn could adversely affect our reputation competitiveness and results of operations a cyberattack or other disruption may also result in financial loss including potential fines for failure to safeguard data our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs arising from such events 

nordson corporation 10 

 

we have taken steps and incurred costs to further strengthen the security of our computer systems and continue to assess maintain and enhance the ongoing effectiveness of our information security systems while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including employee training comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems our systems networks products solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats the techniques used by criminals to obtain unauthorized ac cess to sensitive data change frequently and often are not recognizable until launched against a target accordingly we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures it is therefore possible that in the future w e may suffer a criminal attack unauthorized parties may gain access to personal information in our possession and we may not be able to identify any such incident in a timely manner 

 

the interpretation and application of data protection laws including federal state and international laws relating to the collection use retention disclosure security and transfer of personally identifiable data in the us europe including but not limited to the european union’s general data protection regulation and elsewhere are uncertain and evolving it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices in addition as a result of existing or new data protection requirements we incur and expect to continue to incur significant ongoing operating costs as part of our significant efforts to protect and safeguard our sensitive data and personal information these efforts also may divert management and employee attention from other business and growth initiatives a breach in information privacy could result in legal or reputational risks and could have a negative impact on our revenues and results of operations

 

our results could be impacted by changes in tariffs trade agreements or other trade restrictions imposed by the us or other governments 

our ability to conduct business can be significantly impacted by changes in tariffs changes or repeals of trade agreements including withdrawal from or material modifications to north american free trade agreement the implementation of the united statesmexicocanada agreement or certain other international trade agreements or other trade restrictions or retaliatory actions imposed by various governments other effects of these changes including impacts on the price of raw materials responsive actions from governments and the opportunity for competitors to establish a presence in markets where we participate could also have significant impacts on our results

our growth strategy includes acquisitions and we may not be able to execute on our acquisition strategy or integrate acquisitions successfully

our recent historical growth has depended and our future growth is likely to continue to depend in part on our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses into our existing operations we intend to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world we cannot assure we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition opportunities prevail against competing potential acquirers negotiate appropriate acquisition terms obtain financing that may be needed to consummate such acquisitions complete proposed acquisitions successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new markets in addition we cannot assure that any acquisition once successfully integrated will perform as planned be accretive to earnings or prove to be beneficial to our operations and cash flow

the success of our acquisition strategy is subject to other risks and uncertainties including















in addition an acquisition could adversely impact our operating performance as a result of the incurrence of acquisitionrelated debt preacquisition potential tax liabilities acquisition expenses the amortization of acquisitionacquired assets or possible future impairments of goodwill or intangible assets associated with the acquisition

nordson corporation 11 

 

we may also face liability with re spect to acquired businesses for violations of environmental laws occurring prior to the date of our acquisition and some or all of these liabilities may not be covered by environmental insurance secured to mitigate the risk or by indemnification from the sellers from which we acquired these businesses we could also incur significant costs including but not limited to remediation costs natural resources damages civil or criminal fines and sanctions and thirdparty claims as a result of past or futur e violations of or liabilities  associated with environmental laws 

significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates or change in monetary policy may harm our financial results

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly with respect to the euro the yen the pound sterling and the chinese yuan any significant change in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business against the united states dollar could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for additional detail related to this risk see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk

the majority of our consolidated revenues in 2018 were generated in currencies other than the united states dollar which is our reporting currency we recognize foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from our operations in the period incurred as a result currency fluctuations between the united states dollar and the currencies in which we do business have caused and will continue to cause foreign currency transaction and translation gains and losses which historically have been material and could continue to be material we cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future operating results because of the number of currencies involved the variability of currency exposures and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates we take actions to manage our foreign currency exposure such as entering into hedging transactions where available but we cannot assure that our strategies will adequately protect our consolidated operating results from the effects of exchange rate fluctuations for example the announcement of brexit and subsequent steps taken by britain to begin withdrawal from the european union caused volatility in global currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the united states dollar against foreign currencies in which we conduct business future adverse consequences arising from brexit may include continued volatility in exchange rates any significant fluctuation in exchange rates may be harmful to our financial condition and results of operations we also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into united states dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or customers located in or conducting business in a country imposing controls currency devaluations diminish the united states dollar value of the currency of the country instituting the devaluation and if they occur or continue for significant periods could adversely affect our earnings or cash flow

any impairment in the value of our intangible assets including goodwill would negatively affect our operating results and total capitalization

our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets primarily goodwill the goodwill results from our acquisitions and represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the identifiable net assets we acquired we assess at least annually whether there has been any impairment in the value of our intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels if competing or alternative technologies emerge if market conditions for acquired businesses decline if significant and prolonged negative industry or economic trends exist if our stock price and market capitalization declines or if future cash flow estimates decline we could incur under current applicable accounting rules a noncash charge to operating earnings for goodwill impairment any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and equity book value the effect of which could be material

changes in united states and international tax law may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions changes in applicable domestic or foreign tax laws and regulations or their interpretation and application including the possibility of retroactive effect could affect our business financial condition and profitability by increasing our tax liabilities our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in our effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates changes in our overall profitability changes in tax legislation and rates changes in generally accepted accounting principles and changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the us federal government may adopt changes to international trade agreements tariffs taxes and other government rules and regulations while we cannot predict what changes will actually occur with respect to any of these items such changes could affect our business and results of operations

nordson corporation 12 

 

if our intellectual property protection is inadequate others may be able to use our technologies and tradenames and thereby reduce our ability to compete which could have a material adverse effect on us our financial condition and results of operations 

we regard much of the technology underlying our products and the trademarks under which we market our products as proprietary the steps we take to protect our proprietary technology may be inadequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or third parties may independently develop similar technology we rely on a combination of patents trademark copyright and trade secret laws employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and other contracts to establish and protect our technology and other intellectual property rights the agreements may be breached or terminated and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach and existing trade secrets patent and copyright law afford us limited protection policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult a third party could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization litigation may be necessary for us to defend against claims of infringement or to protect our intellectual property rights and could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our efforts further we might not prevail in such litigation which could harm our business

our products could infringe on the intellectual property of others which may cause us to engage in costly litigation and if we are not successful could cause us to pay substantial damages and prohibit us from selling our products

third parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us based on their patents or other intellectual property claims and we may have to pay substantial damages possibly including treble damages if it is ultimately determined our products infringe we may have to obtain a license to sell our products if it is determined that our products infringe upon another party’s intellectual property we might be prohibited from selling our products before we obtain a license which if available at all may require us to pay substantial royalties even if infringement claims against us are without merit defending these types of lawsuits takes significant time may be expensive and may divert management attention from other business concerns

we may be exposed to liabilities under the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa which could have a material adverse effect on our business

we are subject to compliance with various laws and regulations including the fcpa and similar worldwide antibribery and anticorruption laws which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or making other improper payments to private or public parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining an unfair business advantage the fcpa also requires proper record keeping and characterization of such payments in our reports filed with the sec our employees are trained and required to comply with these laws and we are committed to legal compliance and corporate ethics violations of these laws could result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and financial penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition or results of operations 

our inability to comply with our existing credit facilities’ restrictive covenants or to access additional sources of capital could impede growth or the repayment or refinancing of existing indebtedness

the limits imposed on us by the restrictive covenants contained in our credit facilities could prevent us from making acquisitions or cause us to lose access to these facilities

our existing credit facilities contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to among other things









in addition our credit facilities require us to meet financial ratios including a “leverage ratio” and an “interest coverage ratio” both as defined in the credit facilities

these restrictions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs and could otherwise restrict our financing activities

our ability to comply with the covenants and other terms of our credit facilities will depend on our future operating performance if we fail to comply with such covenants and terms we may be in default and the maturity of the related debt could be accelerated and become immediately due and payable we may be required to obtain waivers from our lenders in order to maintain compliance under our credit facilities including waivers with respect to our compliance with certain financial covenants if we are unable to obtain necessary waivers and the debt under our credit facilities is accelerated we would be required to obtain replacement financing at prevailing market rates

nordson corporation 13 

 

we ma y need new or additional financing in the future to expand our business or refinance existing indebtedness if we are unable to access capital on satisfactory terms and conditions we may not be able to expand our business or meet our payment requirements under our existing credit facilities our ability to obtain new or additional financing will depend on a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control we may not be able to obtain new or additional financing because we have substantial debt or because we may not have sufficient cash flow to service or repay our existing or future debt in addition depending on market conditions and our financial performance neither debt nor equity financing may be available on satisfactory terms or at all fin ally as a consequence of worsening financial market conditions our credit facility providers may not provide the agreed credit if they become undercapitalized 

changes in interest rates could adversely affect us

any period of interest rate increases may also adversely affect our profitability at october 31 2018 we had 1314091 of total debt and notes payable outstanding of which 51 percent was priced at interest rates that float with the market a one percentage point increase in the interest rate on the floating rate debt in 2018 would have resulted in approximately 10672 of additional interest expense a higher level of floating rate debt would increase the exposure to changes in interest rates for additional detail related to this risk see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk

failure to retain our existing senior management team or the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could hurt our business and inhibit our ability to operate and grow successfully

our success will continue to depend to a significant extent on the continued service of our executive management team and the ability to recruit hire and retain other key management personnel to support our growth and operational initiatives and replace executives who retire or resign failure to retain our leadership team and attract and retain other important management and technical personnel could place a constraint on our global growth and operational initiatives possibly resulting in inefficient and ineffective management and operations which would likely harm our revenues operations and product development efforts and eventually result in a decrease in profitability

the level of returns on pension plan assets and changes in the actuarial assumptions used could adversely affect us

our operating results may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of expense we record for our defined benefit pension plans us gaap requires that we calculate pension expense using actuarial valuations which are dependent upon our various assumptions including estimates of expected longterm rate of return on plan assets discount rates for future payment obligations and the expected rate of increase in future compensation levels our pension expense and funding requirements may also be affected by our actual return on plan assets and by legislation and other government regulatory actions changes in assumptions laws or regulations could lead to variability in operating results and could have a material adverse impact on liquidity

political conditions in the us and foreign countries in which we operate could adversely affect us

we conduct our manufacturing sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and are subject to risks associated with doing business outside the united states in 2018 approximately 68 percent of our total sales were generated outside the united states we expect that international operations and united states export sales will continue to be important to our business for the foreseeable future both sales from international operations and export sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside the united states such risks include but are not limited to the following















nordson corporation 14 

 





any of these events could reduce the demand for our products limit the prices at which we can sell our products interrupt our supply chain or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operating performance

our international operations also depend upon favorable trade relations between the us and those foreign countries in which our customers subcontractors and materials suppliers have operations a protectionist trade environment in either the us or those foreign countries in which we do business such as a change in the current tariff structures export compliance or other trade policies may materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our products in foreign markets the current us presidential administration has criticized existing trade agreements and while it is currently unclear what actions the administration may take with respect to existing and proposed trade agreements or restrictions on trade generally more stringent export and import controls may be ultimately imposed in the future

our business and operating results may be adversely affected by natural disasters or other catastrophic events beyond our control

while we have taken precautions to prevent production and service interruptions at our global facilities severe weather conditions such as hurricanes or tornadoes as well as major earthquakes wildfires and other natural disasters as well as cyberterrorism in areas in which we have manufacturing facilities or from which we obtain products may cause physical damage to our properties closure of one or more of our manufacturing or distribution facilities lack of an adequate work force in a market temporary disruption in the supply of inventory disruption in the transport of products and utilities and delays in the delivery of products to our customers any of these factors may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

the insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures

we maintain property business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered we are potentially at risk if one or more of our insurance carriers fail additionally severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the ratings and survival of some insurers in the future we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain

 item 3 legal proceedings

we are involved in pending or potential litigation regarding environmental product liability patent contract employee and other matters arising from the normal course of business including the environmental matter discussed below after consultation with legal counsel we believe that the probability is remote that losses in excess of the amounts we have accrued would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition quarterly or annual operating results or cash flows

environmental – we have voluntarily agreed with the city of new richmond wisconsin and other potentially responsible parties to share costs associated with the remediation of the city of new richmond municipal landfill the “site” and constructing a potable water delivery system serving the impacted area down gradient of the site at october 31 2018 and 2017 our accrual for the ongoing operation maintenance and monitoring obligation at the site was 439 and 472 respectively 

the liability for environmental remediation represents management’s best estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable undiscounted costs related to known remediation obligations the accuracy of our estimate of environmental liability is affected by several uncertainties such as additional requirements that may be identified in connection with remedial activities the complexity and evolution of environmental laws and regulations and the identification of presently unknown remediation requirements consequently our liability could be different than our current estimate however we do not expect that the costs associated with remediation will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

critical accounting policies and estimates

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses on an ongoing basis we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that are used to prepare financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates used by management

certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below on a regular basis critical accounting policies are reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors

revenue recognition – most of our revenues are recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the sales price is fixed or determinable collectibility is reasonably assured and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer certain arrangements may include installation installation supervision training and spare parts which tend to be completed in a short period of time at an insignificant cost and utilizing skills not unique to us and therefore are typically regarded as inconsequential or perfunctory revenue for undelivered items is deferred and included within accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet revenues deferred in 2018 2017 and 2016 were not material 

business combinations – the acquisitions of our businesses are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting the amounts assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions are based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition with the remainder if any recorded as goodwill the fair values are determined by management taking into consideration information supplied by the management of the acquired entities and other relevant information such information typically includes valuations obtained from independent appraisal experts which management reviews and considers in its estimates of fair values the valuations are generally based upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets discounted to present value the determination of fair values requires significant judgment by management particularly with respect to the value of identifiable intangible assets this judgment could result in either a higher or lower value assigned to amortizable or depreciable assets the impact could result in either higher or lower amortization andor depreciation expense 

goodwill – goodwill is the excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in various business combinations goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level or more often if indications of impairment exist our reporting units are the adhesive dispensing systems segment the industrial coating systems segment and one level below the advanced technology systems segment 

we test goodwill in accordance with accounting standards codification asc 350 goodwill impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in the quantitative analysis described below we did not record any goodwill impairment charges in 2018 we use an independent valuation specialist to assist with refining our assumptions and methods used to determine fair values using these methods to test for goodwill impairment we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units using a combination of the income approach and the market approach 

the discounted cash flow method income approach uses assumptions for revenue growth operating margin and working capital turnover that are based on management’s strategic plans tempered by performance trends and reasonable expectations about those trends terminal value calculations employ a published formula known as the gordon growth model method that essentially captures the present value of perpetual cash flows beyond the last projected period assuming a constant weighted average cost of capital wacc methodology and growth rate for each reporting unit a sensitivity analysis is performed to vary the discount and terminal growth rates in order to provide a range of reasonableness for detecting impairment discount rates are developed using a wacc methodology the wacc represents the blended average required rate of return for equity and debt capital based on observed market return data and company specific risk factors for 2018 the discount rates used ranged from 95 percent to 12 percent depending upon the reporting units size end market volatility and projection risk 

nordson corporation 21 

 

in the applicatio n of the guideline public company method market approach fair value is determined using transactional evidence for similar publicly traded equity the comparable company guideline group is determined based on relative similarities to each reporting unit since exact correlations are not available an indication of fair value for each reporting unit is based on the placement of each reporting unit within a range of multiples determined for its comparable guideline company group valuation multiples are de r ived by dividing latest twelve month performance for revenues and ebitda into total invested capital which is the sum of traded equity plus interest bearing debt less cash these multiples are applied against the revenue and ebitda of each reporting unit while the implied indications of fair value using the guideline public company method yield meaningful results the discounted cash flow method of the income approach includes management’s thoughtful projections and insights as to what the reporting units will accomplish in the near future accordingly the reasonable implied fair value of each reporting unit is a blend based on the consideration of both the income and market approaches 

in 2018 2017 and 2016 the results of our annual impairment tests indicated no impairment

the excess of fair value fv over carrying value cv was compared to the carrying value for each reporting unit based on the results shown in the table below and based on our measurement date of august 1 2018 our conclusion is that no goodwill was impaired in 2018 potential events or circumstances such as a sustained downturn in global economies could have a negative effect on estimated fair values

 



 

pension plans and postretirement medical plans  the measurement of liabilities related to our pension plans and postretirement medical plans is based on management’s assumptions related to future factors including interest rates return on pension plan assets compensation increases mortality and turnover assumptions and health care cost trend rates 

the weightedaverage discount rate used to determine the present value of our domestic pension plan obligations was 453 percent at october 31 2018 and 380 percent at october 31 2017 the weightedaverage discount rate used to determine the present value of our various international pension plan obligations was 214 percent at october 31 2018 compared to 207 percent at october 31 2017 the discount rates used for all plans were determined by using quality fixed income investments with a duration period approximately equal to the period over which pension obligations are expected to be settled

in determining the expected return on plan assets we consider both historical performance and an estimate of future longterm rates of return on assets similar to those in our plans we consult with and consider the opinions of financial and actuarial experts in developing appropriate return assumptions the expected rate of return longterm investment rate on domestic pension assets used to determine net benefit costs was 600 percent in 2018 and 625 percent in 2017 the average expected rate of return on international pension assets used to determine net benefit costs was 391 percent in 2018 and 351 percent in 2017

the assumed rate of compensation increases used to determine the present value of our domestic pension plan obligations was 390 percent at october 31 2018 compared to 361 percent at october 31 2017 the assumed rate of compensation increases used to determine the present value of our international pension plan obligations was 312 percent at october 31 2018 compared to 313 percent at october 31 2017

annual expense amounts are determined based on the discount rate used at the end of the prior year differences between actual and assumed investment returns on pension plan assets result in actuarial gains or losses that are amortized into expense over a period of years

nordson corporation 22 

 

economic assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported the effect of a one percent change in the discount rate expec ted return on assets and compensation increase is shown in the table below bracketed numbers represent decreases in expense and obligation amounts 

 



 

with respect to the domestic postretirement medical plan the discount rate used to value the benefit plan was 456 percent at october 31 2018 and 386 percent at october 31 2017 the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the health care cost trend rate is assumed to be 375 percent in 2019 decreasing gradually to 327 percent in 2026

for the international postretirement plan the discount rate used to value the benefit obligation was 388 percent at october 31 2018 and 352 percent at october 31 2017 the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the health care cost trend rate is assumed to be 635 percent in 2019 decreasing gradually to 350 percent in 2037 

the discount rate and the health care cost trend rate assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported for example a onepercentage point change in the discount rate and the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects bracketed numbers represent decreases in expense and obligation amounts

 



 

employees hired after january 1 2002 are not eligible to participate in the domestic postretirement medical plan 

in the fourth quarter of 2016 we adopted a change in the method to be used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for defined benefit pension plans historically for the vast majority of our plans the service and interest cost components were estimated using a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period beginning in 2017 we used a spot rate approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows in the estimation of the service and interest components of benefit cost resulting in a more precise measurement this change did not affect the measurement of total benefit obligations the change was accounted for as a change in estimate that is inseparable from a change in accounting principle and accordingly was accounted for prospectively starting in 2017 the reductions in service and interest costs for 2017 associated with this change were 1200 and 3100 respectively 

pension and postretirement expenses in 2019 are expected to be approximately 990 lower than 2018

income taxes – income taxes are estimated based on income for financial reporting purposes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabili ties for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes and certain changes in valuation allowances we provide valuation allowances against deferred tax assets if based on available evidence it is more likely than not that som e portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

management believes the valuation allowances are adequate after considering future taxable income allowable carryforward periods and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize the deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount including the valuation allowance an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made conversely should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be expensed in the period such determination was made

further at each interim reporting period we estimate an effective income tax rate that is expected to be applicable for the full year judgment is involved regarding the application of global income tax laws and regulations and when projecting the jurisdictional mix of income additionally interpretation of tax laws court decisions or other guidance provided by taxing authorities influences our estimate of the effective income tax rates as a result our actual effective income tax rates and related income tax liabilities may differ materially from our estimated effective tax rates and related income tax liabilities any resulting differences are recorded in the period they become known

2018 compared to 2017

sales – worldwide sales for 2018 were 2254668 an increase of 91 percent from 2017 sales of 2066982 sales volume increased 71 percent and favorable currency translation effects increased sales by 20 percent the volume increase consisted of 25 percent from organic growth and 46 percent from acquisitions we had two acquisitions during 2018 sonoscan inc “sonoscan” and cladach nua teoranta “clada” which are both included within the advanced technology systems segment we had four acquisitions during 2017 ace production technologies inc “ace” plaspak industries inc “plaspak interselect gmbh “interselect” and vention medical’s advanced technologies business “vention” which are also included within the advanced technology systems segment as used throughout this form 10k geographic regions include the americas canada mexico and central and south america asia pacific excluding japan europe japan and the united states 

sales of the adhesive dispensing systems segment were 955192 in 2018 an increase of 39173 or 43 percent from 2017 sales of 916019 the increase was the result of a sales volume increase of 15 percent and favorable currency effects that increased sales by 28 percent within this segment sales volume increased in all geographic regions with the exception of the united states growth in packaging and product assembly product lines was offset by softness in product lines serving polymer processing end markets

it is estimated that the effect of pricing on 2018 tot al sales was not material relative to 2017 

operating profit – cost of sales were 1018703 in 2018 up 98 percent from 927981 in 2017 gross profit expressed as a percentage of sales decreased to 548 percent in 2018 from 551 percent in 2017 of the 03 percentage point decrease in gross margin unfavorable product mix contributed 07 percentage points offset by 04 percentage points due to favorable currency translation effects

selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to 326 percent in 2018 from 328 percent in 2017 of the 02 percentage point improvement 07 percentage points is due to lower acquisition transaction costs offset by 05 percentage points due to higher base business costs 

severance and restructuring costs of 6552 were recorded in 2018 within the adhesives dispensing systems segment a restructuring initiative to consolidate certain polymer processing product line facilities in the us resulted in severance and restructuring costs of 5631 within the advanced technology systems segment severance costs of 401 were recorded in europe severance costs of 520 were recorded in the us due to a corporate restructuring initiative no costs related to severance and restructuring were recorded in the industrial coating systems segment in 2018 additional costs related to these initiatives are not expected to be material in future periods all severance and restructuring costs are included in selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income 

operating capacity for each of our segments can support fluctuations in order activity without significant changes in operating costs also currency translation affects reported operating margins operating margins for each segment were favorably impacted by a weaker dollar primarily against the euro during 2018 as compared to 2017

operating profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 219 percent in 2018 compared to 221 percent in 2017 of the 02 percentage point decline in operating margin unfavorable leverage of our selling and administrative expenses contributed 09 percentage points higher severance and restructuring expenses contributed 02 percentage points and unfavorable product mix contributed 07 percentage points this decline was offset by 03 percentage points due to the first year effect of acquisitions 07 percentage points due to lower acquisition transaction costs and 06 percentage points due to favorable foreign currency translation effects

for the adhesive dispensing systems segment operating profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 272 percent in 2018 compared to 277 percent in 2017 of the 05 percentage point decline in operating margin dilution in gross margin of 08 percentage points was due to the consolidation of certain facilities in the us and higher severance and restructuring expenses contributed 03 percentage points offset by favorable foreign currency translation effects of 06 percentage points

on december 22 2017 the us tax cuts and jobs act the act was enacted it reduced the us federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent we hav e an october 31 fiscal yearend therefore the lower corporate income tax rate will be phased in resulting in a us statutory federal rate of 2334 percent for our fiscal year ended october 31 2018 and 21 percent for subsequent fiscal years the statu tory tax rate of 2334 percent was applied to earnings in the current year 

the act requires us to revalue our existing us deferred tax balance to reflect the lower statutory tax rate and pay a onetime transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously deferred from us taxes as a result during 2018 we recorded a provisional tax benefit of 49082 to reflect the revaluation of our tax assets and liabilities at the reduced corporate tax rate we also recorded a provisional tax expense of 27618 to reflect the transition tax on previously deferred foreign earnings the net tax effect of these discrete items resulted in a decrease of 21464 in income tax expense for 2018 we intend to pay the transition tax in installments over the eightyear period allowable under the act the transition tax is primarily included in other longterm liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at october 31 2018 incremental adjustments have been made to these estimates during the three months ended october 31 2018 based on availability of additional information the amounts recorded are considered a provisional estimate under the us securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 118 the provisional calculations may change after various components of the computation are finalized furthermore we are still analyzing certain aspects of the act and related interpretive guidance and refining our calculations which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances or give rise to new or additional deferred tax amounts certain provisions of the act will impact the company starting in 2019 these provisions include but are not limited to the creation of the base erosion antiabuse tax a general limitation of us federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries a new provision designed to tax global intangible lowtaxed income and the repeal of the domestic production activities deduction we continue to evaluate the future impacts of these provisions and as of october 31 2018 have not recorded any impact of any of these future provisions

in march 2016 the fasb issued a new standard which simplifies the accounting for sharebased payment transactions which we adopted in the first quarter of 2018 this guidance requires that excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statements of income rather than as additional paidin capital our income tax provision for 2018 also includes a favorable adjustment to unrecognized tax benefits of 1120 related to the lapse of the statute of limitations

our income tax provision for 2017 includes a discrete tax expense of 1070 related to nondeductible acquisition costs

we believe that the combination of present capital resources cash from operations and unused financing sources are more than adequate to meet cash requirements for 2019 there are no significant restrictions limiting the transfer of funds from international subsidiaries to the parent company

outlook

our operating performance balance sheet position and financial ratios for 2018 remained strong relative to recent years although uncertainties persisted in global financial markets and the general economic environment going forward we are wellpositioned to manage our liquidity needs that arise from working capital requirements capital expenditures contributions related to pension and postretirement obligations and principal and interest payments on indebtedness primary sources of capital to meet these needs as well as other opportunistic investments are cash provided by operations and borrowings under our loan agreements in 2018 cash from operations was 224 percent of revenue with respect to borrowings under existing loan agreements as of october 31 2018 we had 797800 available capacity under our fiveyear term 850000 unsecured multicurrency credit facility this credit facility expires in february 2020 

respective to all of these loans are two primary covenants the leverage ratio that restricts indebtedness net of cash to a maximum 350 times consolidated fourquarter trailing ebitda and the interest coverage ratio that requires fourquarter trailing ebitda to be at minimum 25 times consolidated trailing fourquarter interest expense debt ebitda and interest expense are as defined in respective credit agreements

regarding expectations for 2019 we are optimistic about longer term growth opportunities in the diverse consumer durable nondurable medical electronics and industrial end markets we serve for 2019 organic sales are expected to increase 3 percent to 5 percent compared to the prior year offset by an unfavorable currency effect of 2 percent based on the current exchange rate environment as compared to the prior year we move forward with caution given continued slower growth in emerging markets than previous years expectations for global gdp indicating a lowgrowth macroeconomic environment tax reform and trade agreement implications and marketplace effects of political instability in certain areas of the world though the pace of improvement in the global economy remains unclear our growth potential has been demonstrated over time from our capacity to build and enhance our core businesses by entering emerging markets pursuing market adjacencies and driving growth initiatives we drive value for our

customers through our application expertise differentiated technology and direct sales and service support our priorities also are focused on operation al efficiencies by employing continuous improvement methodologies in our business processes we expect our efforts will continue to provide more than sufficient cash from operations for meeting our liquidity needs and paying dividends to common shareholde rs as well as enabling us to invest in the development of new applications and markets for our technologies cash from operations have been 16 to 22 percent of revenues over the past five years which when combined with our available borrowing capacity and ready access to capital markets  is more than adequate to fund our liquidity needs over the next year

effects of foreign currency

the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on sales and operating results cannot be precisely measured due to fluctuating selling prices sales volume product mix and cost structures in each country where we operate as a general rule a weakening of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies has a favorable effect on sales and net income while a strengthening of the dollar has a detrimental effect

in 2018 as compared with 2017 the united states dollar was generally weaker against foreign currencies if 2017 exchange rates had been in effect during 2018 sales would have been approximately 41800 lower and thirdparty costs would have been approximately 21708 higher in 2017 as compared with 2016 the united states dollar was generally stronger against foreign currencies if 2016 exchange rates had been in effect during 2017 sales would have been approximately 8210 higher and thirdparty costs would have been approximately 5791 higher these effects on reported sales do not include the impact of local price adjustments made in response to changes in currency exchange rates

inflation

inflation affects profit margins as the ability to pass cost increases on to customers is restricted by the need for competitive pricing although inflation has been modest in recent years and has had no material effect on the years covered by the financial statements included in this report we continue to seek ways to minimize the impact of inflation through focused efforts to increase productivity

we also have variablerate notes payable and longterm debt the weighted average interest rate of this debt was 32 percent at october 31 2018 and 23 percent at october 31 2017 a one percent increase in interest rates would have resulted in additional interest expense of approximately 10672 on the variable rate notes payable and longterm debt in 2018

our production operations include machining molding and assembly we manufacture specially designed parts and assemble components into finished equipment many components are made in standard modules that can be used in more than one product or in combination with other components for a variety of models we have principal manufacturing operations and sources of supply in the united states in ohio georgia california colorado connecticut massachusetts michigan minnesota new jersey north carolina rhode island tennessee washington and wisconsin as well as in the people’s republic of china germany ireland israel mexico the netherlands thailand and the united kingdom

principal materials used to make our products are metals and plastics typically in sheets bar stock castings forgings tubing and pellets we also purchase many electrical and electronic components fabricated metal parts highpressure fluid hoses packings seals and other items integral to our products suppliers are competitively selected based on cost quality and service all significant raw materials that we use are available through multiple sources

senior operating management supervise an extensive quality control program for our equipment machinery and systems and manufacturing processes

natural gas and other fuels are our primary energy sources however standby capacity for alternative sources is available if needed




 item 1a ri sk factors 

in an enterprise as diverse as ours a wide range of factors could affect future performance we discuss in this section some of the risk factors that if they actually occurred could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition value and results of operations you should consider these risk factors in connection with evaluating the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k because these factors could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected in forwardlooking statements

the significant risk factors affecting our operations include the following

changes in united states or international economic conditions including declines in the industries we serve could adversely affect the profitability of any of our operations

in 2017 approximately 31 percent of our revenue was generated in the united states while approximately 69 percent was generated outside the united states our largest markets include appliance automotive construction container electronics assembly food and beverage furniture medical metal finishing nonwovens packaging paper and paperboard converting plastics processing and semiconductor a slowdown in any of these specific end markets could directly affect our revenue stream and profitability

a portion of our product sales is attributable to industries and markets such as the semiconductor mobile electronics polymer processing and metal finishing industries which historically have been cyclical and sensitive to relative changes in supply and demand and general economic conditions the demand for our products depends in part on the general economic conditions of the industries or national economies of our customers downward economic cycles in our customers’ industries or countries may reduce sales of some of our products it is not possible to predict accurately the factors that will affect demand for our products in the future

any significant downturn in the health of the general economy globally regionally or in the markets in which we sell products could have an adverse effect on our revenues and financial performance resulting in impairment of assets

if we fail to develop new products or our customers do not accept the new products we develop our revenue and profitability could be adversely impacted

innovation is critical to our success we believe that we must continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and manufacture new products with improved capabilities in order to continue to be a leading provider of precision technology solutions for the industrial equipment market we also believe that we must continue to make improvements in our productivity in order to maintain our competitive position difficulties or delays in research development or production of new products or failure to gain market acceptance of new products and technologies may reduce future sales and adversely affect our competitive position we continue to invest in the development and marketing of new products there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses if we fail to make innovations launch products with quality problems or the market does not accept our new products our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected in addition as new or enhanced products are introduced we must successfully manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption in customers’ ordering patterns avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that we can deliver sufficient supplies of new products to meet customers’ demands

our growth strategy includes acquisitions and we may not be able to execute on our acquisition strategy or integrate acquisitions successfully

our recent historical growth has depended and our future growth is likely to continue to depend in part on our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses into our existing operations in march 2017 we completed the acquisition of vention a leading designer developer and manufacturer of minimally invasive interventional delivery devices catheters and advanced components for the global medical technology market failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of the vention acquisition could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy and could have an adverse effect on the acquired company’s business financial condition operating results and prospects in addition it is possible that the integration process could result in the disruption of our ongoing businesses or cause inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 

we intend to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world we cannot assure we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition opportunities prevail against competing potential acquirers negotiate appropriate acquisition terms obtain financing that may be needed to 

nordson corporation 10 

 

consummate such acquisitions complete proposed acquisitions successfully integrate acquired busines ses into our existing operations or expand into new markets in addition we cannot assure that any acquisition once successfully integrated will perform as planned be accretive to earnings or prove to be beneficial to our operations and cash flow 

the success of our acquisition strategy is subject to other risks and uncertainties including















in addition an acquisition could adversely impact our operating performance as a result of the incurrence of acquisitionrelated debt preacquisition potential tax liabilities acquisition expenses the amortization of acquisitionacquired assets or possible future impairments of goodwill or intangible assets associated with the acquisition

we may also face liability with respect to acquired businesses for violations of environmental laws occurring prior to the date of our acquisition and some or all of these liabilities may not be covered by environmental insurance secured to mitigate the risk or by indemnification from the sellers from which we acquired these businesses we could also incur significant costs including but not limited to remediation costs natural resources damages civil or criminal fines and sanctions and thirdparty claims as a result of past or future violations of or liabilities associated with environmental laws

increased it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems networks products solutions and services

increased global it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including employee training comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems our systems networks products solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats depending on their nature and scope such threats could potentially lead to the compromising of confidential information including but not limited to confidential information relating to customer or employee data improper use of our systems and networks manipulation and destruction of data defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions which in turn could adversely affect our reputation competitiveness and results of operations

the interpretation and application of data protection laws including federal state and international laws relating to the collection use retention disclosure security and transfer of personally identifiable data in the us europe including but not limited to the general data protection regulation and elsewhere are uncertain and evolving it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices complying with these laws may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business 

significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates or change in monetary policy may harm our financial results

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly with respect to the euro the yen the pound sterling and the chinese yuan any significant change in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business against the united states dollar could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for additional detail related to this risk see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk

the majority of our consolidated revenues in 2017 were generated in currencies other than the united states dollar which is our reporting currency we recognize foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from our operations in the period incurred as a result currency fluctuations between the united states dollar and the currencies in which we do business have caused and will continue to cause foreign currency transaction and translation gains and losses which historically have been material and could continue to be material we cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future operating results because of the 

nordson corporation 11 

 

number of currencies involved the variability of currency exposures and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates we take actions to manage our foreign currency exposure such as entering into hedging transactions where available but we cannot assure that our strategies will adequately protect our consolidated operating results from the effects of exchange rate fluctuations for example the ann ouncement of brexit and subsequent steps taken by britain to begin withdrawal from the european union caused volatility in global currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the united states dollar against foreign currencies in which we conduct business future adverse consequences arising from brexit may include continued volatility in exchange rates any significant fluctuation in exchange rates may be harmful to our financial condition and results of operations we also f ace risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into united states dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or c ustomers located in or conducting business in a country imposing controls currency devaluations diminish the united states dollar value of the currency of the country instituting the devaluation and if they occur or continue for significant periods coul d adversely affect our earnings or cash flow 

any impairment in the value of our intangible assets including goodwill would negatively affect our operating results and total capitalization

our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets primarily goodwill the goodwill results from our acquisitions and represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the identifiable net assets we acquired we assess at least annually whether there has been any impairment in the value of our intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels if competing or alternative technologies emerge if market conditions for acquired businesses decline if significant and prolonged negative industry or economic trends exist if our stock price and market capitalization declines or if future cash flow estimates decline we could incur under current applicable accounting rules a noncash charge to operating earnings for goodwill impairment any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and equity book value the effect of which could be material

changes in united states and international tax law may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions changes in applicable domestic or foreign tax laws and regulations or their interpretation and application including the possibility of retroactive effect could affect our business financial condition and profitability by increasing our tax liabilities our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in our effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates changes in our overall profitability changes in tax legislation and rates changes in generally accepted accounting principles and changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the us federal government may adopt changes to international trade agreements tariffs taxes and other government rules and regulations while we cannot predict what changes will actually occur with respect to any of these items such changes could affect our business and results of operations

if our intellectual property protection is inadequate others may be able to use our technologies and tradenames and thereby reduce our ability to compete which could have a material adverse effect on us our financial condition and results of operations

we regard much of the technology underlying our products and the trademarks under which we market our products as proprietary the steps we take to protect our proprietary technology may be inadequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or third parties may independently develop similar technology we rely on a combination of patents trademark copyright and trade secret laws employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and other contracts to establish and protect our technology and other intellectual property rights the agreements may be breached or terminated and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach and existing trade secrets patent and copyright law afford us limited protection policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult a third party could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization litigation may be necessary for us to defend against claims of infringement or to protect our intellectual property rights and could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our efforts further we might not prevail in such litigation which could harm our business

our products could infringe on the intellectual property of others which may cause us to engage in costly litigation and if we are not successful could cause us to pay substantial damages and prohibit us from selling our products

third parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us based on their patents or other intellectual property claims and we may have to pay substantial damages possibly including treble damages if it is ultimately determined our products infringe we may have to obtain a license to sell our products if it is determined that our products infringe upon another party’s intellectual property we might be prohibited from selling our products before we obtain a license which if available at all 

nordson corporation 12 

 

may require us to pay substantial royalties even if infringement claims against us are without merit defending these types of lawsuits takes significant time may be expensive and may divert management attention from other b usiness concerns 

we may be exposed to liabilities under the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa which could have a material adverse effect on our business

we are subject to compliance with various laws and regulations including the fcpa and similar worldwide antibribery and anticorruption laws which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or making other improper payments to private or public parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining an unfair business advantage the fcpa also requires proper record keeping and characterization of such payments in our reports filed with the sec our employees are trained and required to comply with these laws and we are committed to legal compliance and corporate ethics violations of these laws could result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and financial penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition or results of operations 

our inability to comply with our existing credit facilities’ restrictive covenants or to access additional sources of capital could impede growth or the repayment or refinancing of existing indebtedness

the limits imposed on us by the restrictive covenants contained in our credit facilities could prevent us from making acquisitions or cause us to lose access to these facilities

our existing credit facilities contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to among other things









in addition our credit facilities require us to meet financial ratios including a “leverage ratio” and an “interest coverage ratio” both as defined in the credit facilities

these restrictions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs and could otherwise restrict our financing activities

our ability to comply with the covenants and other terms of our credit facilities will depend on our future operating performance if we fail to comply with such covenants and terms we may be in default and the maturity of the related debt could be accelerated and become immediately due and payable we may be required to obtain waivers from our lenders in order to maintain compliance under our credit facilities including waivers with respect to our compliance with certain financial covenants if we are unable to obtain necessary waivers and the debt under our credit facilities is accelerated we would be required to obtain replacement financing at prevailing market rates

we may need new or additional financing in the future to expand our business or refinance existing indebtedness if we are unable to access capital on satisfactory terms and conditions we may not be able to expand our business or meet our payment requirements under our existing credit facilities our ability to obtain new or additional financing will depend on a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control we may not be able to obtain new or additional financing because we have substantial debt or because we may not have sufficient cash flow to service or repay our existing or future debt in addition depending on market conditions and our financial performance neither debt nor equity financing may be available on satisfactory terms or at all finally as a consequence of worsening financial market conditions our credit facility providers may not provide the agreed credit if they become undercapitalized

changes in interest rates could adversely affect us

any period of interest rate increases may also adversely affect our profitability at october 31 2017 we had 1582984 of total debt and notes payable outstanding of which 80 percent was priced at interest rates that float with the market a one percent increase in the interest rate on the floating rate debt in 2017 would have resulted in approximately 11064 of additional interest expense a higher level of floating rate debt would increase the exposure to changes in interest rates for additional detail related to this risk see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk

nordson corporation 13 

 

failure to retain our existing senior management team or the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could hurt our business and inhibit our ability to operate and grow successfully 

our success will continue to depend to a significant extent on the continued service of our executive management team and the ability to recruit hire and retain other key management personnel to support our growth and operational initiatives and replace executives who retire or resign failure to retain our leadership team and attract and retain other important management and technical personnel could place a constraint on our global growth and operational initiatives possibly resulting in inefficient and ineffective management and operations which would likely harm our revenues operations and product development efforts and eventually result in a decrease in profitability

the level of returns on pension plan assets and changes in the actuarial assumptions used could adversely affect us

our operating results may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of expense we record for our defined benefit pension plans us gaap requires that we calculate pension expense using actuarial valuations which are dependent upon our various assumptions including estimates of expected longterm rate of return on plan assets discount rates for future payment obligations and the expected rate of increase in future compensation levels our pension expense and funding requirements may also be affected by our actual return on plan assets and by legislation and other government regulatory actions changes in assumptions laws or regulations could lead to variability in operating results and could have a material adverse impact on liquidity

regulations related to conflictfree minerals may result in additional expenses that could affect our financial condition and business operations

pursuant to the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the sec promulgated final rules regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals known as conflict minerals which are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries as well as procedures regarding a manufacturer’s efforts to prevent the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from those minerals these new disclosure obligations will require continuing due diligence efforts to support our future disclosure requirements we incurred and will continue to incur costs associated with complying with such disclosure requirements including costs associated with canvassing our supply chain to determine the source country of any conflict minerals incorporated in our products in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities in addition the implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products

political conditions in the us and foreign countries in which we operate could adversely affect us

we conduct our manufacturing sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and are subject to risks associated with doing business outside the united states in 2017 approximately 69 percent of our total sales were generated outside the united states we expect that international operations and united states export sales will continue to be important to our business for the foreseeable future both sales from international operations and export sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside the united states such risks include but are not limited to the following





















nordson corporation 14 

 

any of these events could reduce the demand for ou r products limit the prices at which we can sell our products interrupt our supply chain or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operating performance 

our international operations also depend upon favorable trade relations between the us and those foreign countries in which our customers subcontractors and materials suppliers have operations a protectionist trade environment in either the us or those foreign countries in which we do business such as a change in the current tariff structures export compliance or other trade policies may materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our products in foreign markets the new us presidential administration has criticized existing trade agreements and while it is currently unclear what actions the administration may take with respect to existing and proposed trade agreements or restrictions on trade generally more stringent export and import controls may be imposed in the future

our business and operating results may be adversely affected by natural disasters or other catastrophic events beyond our control

while we have taken precautions to prevent production and service interruptions at our global facilities severe weather conditions such as hurricanes or tornadoes as well as major earthquakes wildfires and other natural disasters as well as cyberterrorism in areas in which we have manufacturing facilities or from which we obtain products may cause physical damage to our properties closure of one or more of our manufacturing or distribution facilities lack of an adequate work force in a market temporary disruption in the supply of inventory disruption in the transport of products and utilities and delays in the delivery of products to our customers any of these factors may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

the insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures

we maintain property business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered we are potentially at risk if one or more of our insurance carriers fail additionally severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the ratings and survival of some insurers in the future we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain

 item 3 legal proceedings

we are involved in pending or potential litigation regarding environmental product liability patent contract employee and other matters arising from the normal course of business including the environmental matter discussed below after consultation with legal counsel we believe that the probability is remote that losses in excess of the amounts we have accrued would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition quarterly or annual operating results or cash flows

environmental – we have voluntarily agreed with the city of new richmond wisconsin and other potentially responsible parties to share costs associated with the remediation of the city of new richmond municipal landfill the “site” and constructing a potable water delivery system serving the impacted area down gradient of the site at october 31 2017 and 2016 our accrual for the ongoing operation maintenance and monitoring obligation at the site was 472 and 516 respectively 

the liability for environmental remediation represents management’s best estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable undiscounted costs related to known remediation obligations the accuracy of our estimate of environmental liability is affected by several uncertainties such as additional requirements that may be identified in connection with remedial activities the complexity and evolution of environmental laws and regulations and the identification of presently unknown remediation requirements consequently our liability could be different than our current estimate however we do not expect that the costs associated with remediation will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

critical accounting policies and estimates

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses on an ongoing basis we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that are used to prepare financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates used by management

certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below on a regular basis critical accounting policies are reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors

revenue recognition – most of our revenues are recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the sales price is fixed or determinable collectibility is reasonably assured and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer certain arrangements may include installation installation supervision training and spare parts which tend to be completed in a short period of time at an insignificant cost and utilizing skills not unique to us and therefore are typically regarded as inconsequential or perfunctory revenue for undelivered items is deferred and included within accrued liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet revenues deferred in 2017 2016 and 2015 were not material 

business combinations – the acquisitions of our businesses are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting the amounts assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions are based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition with the remainder if any recorded as goodwill the fair values are determined by management taking into consideration information supplied by the management of the acquired entities and other relevant information such information typically includes valuations obtained from independent appraisal experts which management reviews and considers in its estimates of fair values the valuations are generally based upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets discounted to present value the determination of fair values requires significant judgment by management particularly with respect to the value of identifiable intangible assets this judgment could result in either a higher or lower value assigned to amortizable or depreciable assets the impact could result in either higher or lower amortization andor depreciation expense 

goodwill – goodwill is the excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in various business combinations goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level or more often if indications of impairment exist our reporting units are the adhesive dispensing systems segment the industrial coating systems segment and one level below the advanced technology systems segment 

we test goodwill in accordance with accounting standards codification asc 350 under a new accounting standard adopted this year see note 2 for additional information a goodwill impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in the quantitative analysis described below we did not record any goodwill impairment charges in 2017 we use an independent valuation specialist to assist with refining our assumptions and methods used to determine fair values using these methods in step one the discounted cash flow method uses assumptions for revenue growth operating margin and working capital turnover that are based on management’s strategic plans tempered by performance trends and reasonable expectations about those trends terminal value calculations employ a published formula known as the gordon growth model method that essentially captures the present value of perpetual cash flows beyond the last projected period assuming a constant weighted average cost of capital wacc methodology and growth rate for each reporting unit a sensitivity analysis is performed to vary the discount and terminal growth rates in order to provide a range of reasonableness for detecting impairment 

nordson corporation 22 

 

discount rates are developed using a wacc methodology the wacc represents the blended average required rate of return for equity and debt capital b ased on observed market return data and company specific risk factors for 2017 the discount rates used ranged from 9 percent to 12 percent depending upon the reporting units size end market volatility and projection risk the calculated internal rate of return for the discounted cash flow method was 9 percent the same as the calculated wacc for total nordson in the application of the guideline public company method fair value is determined using transactional evidence for similar publicly traded equ ity the comparable company guideline group is determined based on relative similarities to each reporting unit since exact correlations are not available an indication of fair value for each reporting unit is based on the placement of each reporting unit within a range of multiples determined for its comparable guideline company group valuation multiples are derived by dividing latest twelve month performance for revenues and ebitda into total invested capital which is the sum of traded equity plus inte rest bearing debt less cash these multiples are applied against the revenue and ebitda of each reporting unit while the implied indications of fair value using the guideline public company method yield meaningful results the discounted cash flow method of the income approach includes management’s thoughtful projections and insights as to what the reporting units will accomplish in the near future accordingly the reasonable implied fair value of each reporting unit is a blend based on the relative stre ngth of the approaches employed 

to test the reasonableness of the aggregate fair value we performed the control premium test which compares the sum of the implied fair values calculated for our reporting units net of debt to the market value of equity the control premium was negative 3 percent as of the test date of august 1 2017 and a slight discount to the market value of equity as of october 31 2017 the control premium indicated that the discounted cash flow valuation was reasonable 

in 2017 and 2016 the results of our annual impairment tests indicated no impairment

the excess of fair value fv over carrying value cv was compared to the carrying value for each reporting unit based on the results shown in the table below and based on our measurement date of august 1 2017 our conclusion is that no goodwill was impaired in 2017 potential events or circumstances such as a sustained downturn in global economies could have a negative effect on estimated fair values

 



 

pension plans and postretirement medical plans  the measurement of liabilities related to our pension plans and postretirement medical plans is based on management’s assumptions related to future factors including interest rates return on pension plan assets compensation increases mortality and turnover assumptions and health care cost trend rates 

the weightedaverage discount rate used to determine the present value of our domestic pension plan obligations was 380 percent at october 31 2017 and 394 percent at october 31 2016 the weightedaverage discount rate used to determine the present value of our various international pension plan obligations was 207 percent at october 31 2017 compared to 186 percent at october 31 2016 the discount rates used for all plans were determined by using quality fixed income investments with a duration period approximately equal to the period over which pension obligations are expected to be settled

in determining the expected return on plan assets we consider both historical performance and an estimate of future longterm rates of return on assets similar to those in our plans we consult with and consider the opinions of financial and actuarial experts in developing appropriate return assumptions the expected rate of return longterm investment rate on domestic pension assets used to determine net benefit costs was 625 percent in 2017 and 672 percent in 2016 the average expected rate of return on international pension assets used to determine net benefit costs was 351 percent in 2017 and 422 percent in 2016

the assumed rate of compensation increases used to determine the present value of our domestic pension plan obligations was 361 percent at october 31 2017 compared to 361 percent at october 31 2016 the assumed rate of compensation increases used to determine the present value of our international pension plan obligations was 313 percent at october 31 2017 compared to 312 percent at october 31 2016

annual expense amounts are determined based on the discount rate used at the end of the pri or year differences between actual and assumed investment returns on pension plan assets result in actuarial gains or losses that are amortized into expense over a period of years 

economic assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported the effect of a one percent change in the discount rate expected return on assets and compensation increase is shown in the table below bracketed numbers represent decreases in expense and obligation amounts

 



 

with respect to the domestic postretirement medical plan the discount rate used to value the benefit plan was 386 percent at october 31 2017 and 405 percent at october 31 2016 the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the health care cost trend rate is assumed to be 370 percent in 2018 decreasing gradually to 323 percent in 2026

for the international postretirement plan the discount rate used to value the benefit obligation was 352 percent at october 31 2017 and 340 percent at october 31 2016 the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the health care cost trend rate is assumed to be 650 percent in 2018 decreasing gradually to 350 percent in 2037 

the discount rate and the health care cost trend rate assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported for example a onepercentage point change in the discount rate and the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects bracketed numbers represent decreases in expense and obligation amounts

 



 

employees hired after january 1 2002 are not eligible to participate in the domestic postretirement medical plan 

in the fourth quarter of 2016 we adopted a change in the method to be used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for defined benefit pension plans historically for the vast majority of our plans the service and interest cost components were estimated using a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period beginning in 2017 we used a spot rate approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows in the estimation of the service and interest components of benefit cost resulting in a more precise measurement this change did not affect the measurement of total benefit obligations the change was accounted for as a change in estimate that is inseparable from a change in accounting principle and accordingly was accounted for prospectively

starting in 2017  the reductions in service and interest costs for 2017 associated with this change were 1200 and 3100 respectively 

pension and postretirement expenses in 2018 are expected to be approximately 474 higher than 2017

income taxes – income taxes are estimated based on income for financial reporting purposes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes and certain changes in valuation allowances we provide valuation allowances against deferred tax assets if based on available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

management believes the valuation allowances are adequate after considering future taxable income allowable carryforward periods and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize the deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount including the valuation allowance an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made conversely should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be expensed in the period such determination was made

further at each interim reporting period we estimate an effective income tax rate that is expected to be applicable for the full year significant judgment is involved regarding the application of global income tax laws and regulations and when projecting the jurisdictional mix of income additionally interpretation of tax laws court decisions or other guidance provided by taxing authorities influences our estimate of the effective income tax rates as a result our actual effective income tax rates and related income tax liabilities may differ materially from our estimated effective tax rates and related income tax liabilities any resulting differences are recorded in the period they become known

we believe that the combination of present capital resources cash from operations and unused financing sources are more than adequate to meet cash requirements for 2018 there are no significant restrictions limiting the transfer of funds from international subsidiaries to the parent company

outlook

our operating performance balance sheet position and financial ratios for 2017 remained strong relative to recent years although uncertainties persisted in global financial markets and the general economic environment going forward we are wellpositioned to manage our liquidity needs that arise from working capital requirements capital expenditures contributions related to pension and postretirement obligations and principal and interest payments on indebtedness primary sources of capital to meet these needs as well as other opportunistic investments are cash provided by operations and borrowings under our loan agreements in 2017 cash from operations was 169 percent of revenue with respect to borrowings under existing loan agreements as of october 31 2017 we had 350862 available capacity under our fiveyear term 600000 unsecured multicurrency credit facility which may be increased to 850000 under certain conditions this credit facility expires in february 2020 in addition we had 53334 borrowing capacity remaining on our 200000 threeyear private shelf agreement with new york life investment management llc while these facilities provide the contractual terms for any borrowing we cannot be assured that these facilities would be available in the event that these financial institutions failed to remain sufficiently capitalized

other loan agreements exist with no remaining borrowing capacity but factor into debt covenant calculations that affect future borrowing capacity in july 2012 we entered into a note purchase agreement with a group of insurance companies under which we sold 200000 of senior notes the notes mature between july 2017 and july 2025 and bear interest at fixed rates between 262 percent and 313 percent as of april 2015 we entered into a 200000 term loan facility with pnc bank 100000 is due in april 2018 and has a weighted average interest rate of 224 percent and 100000 is due in april 2020 and has a weighted average interest rate of 234 percent in july 2015 we entered into a note purchase agreement under which 100000 of senior unsecured notes were 

nordson corporation 31 

 

purchased primarily by a group of insurance companies the notes consist of two tranches series a and b at 50000 each maturing in july 2025 and july 2027 and bearing interest at fixed rates of 289 percent and 319 percent  respectively in october 2015 we entered into a €70000 three year term loan agreement with bank of america merrill lynch international in london this agreement was amended in september 2016 to extend the term by one year and increase the principal b alance the balance of this loan at october 31 2017 was €10467  the interest rate is variable based on the libor rate plus applicable margin based on our leverage ratio and the weighted average interest rate was 100 percent at october 31 2017  in m arch 2017 we entered into a 705000 term loan facility with a group of banks the term agreement provides for terms loans in three tranches 200000 due in october 2018 200000 due in march 2020 and 305000 due in march 2022 the weighted average i nterest rate for borrowings under this agreement was 233 percent at october 31 2017 

respective to all of these loans are two primary covenants the leverage ratio that restricts indebtedness net of cash to a maximum 350 times consolidated fourquarter trailing ebitda and the interest coverage ratio that requires fourquarter trailing ebitda to be at minimum 30 times consolidated trailing fourquarter interest expense debt ebitda and interest expense are as defined in respective credit agreements

regarding expectations for 2018 we are optimistic about longer term growth opportunities in the diverse consumer durable nondurable medical electronics and industrial end markets we serve for the first quarter of 2018 sales are expected to increase 30 percent to 34 percent compared to the first quarter a year ago this growth includes organic volume up 15 percent to 19 percent 11 percent growth from the first year effect of acquisitions and a positive currency effect of 4 percent based on the current exchange rate environment the short cycle nature of our end markets does not provide much visibility beyond a fiscal quarter however we do expect growth rates to moderate beyond our first quarter particularly when considering our challenging comparisons to the prior year we move forward with caution given continued slow growth in emerging markets expectations for global gdp indicating a lowgrowth macroeconomic environment tax reform and trade agreement implications and marketplace effects of political instability in certain areas of the world 

though the pace of improvement in the global economy remains unclear our growth potential has been demonstrated over time from our capacity to build and enhance our core businesses by entering emerging markets and pursuing market adjacencies we drive value for our customers through our application expertise differentiated technology and direct sales and service support our priorities also are focused on operational efficiencies by employing continuous improvement methodologies in our business processes we expect our efforts will continue to provide more than sufficient cash from operations for meeting our liquidity needs and paying dividends to common shareholders as well as enabling us to invest in the development of new applications and markets for our technologies cash from operations have been 16 to 18 percent of revenues over the past five years resulting in more than sufficient cash for our ordinary business requirements we believe cash provided from operations our available borrowing capacity and ready access to capital markets is more than adequate to fund our liquidity needs within the next year 

with respect to contractual spending the table above presents our financial obligations as 1824861 of which 459201 is payable in 2018 in august 2015 the board of directors approved a 200000 common share repurchase program that added capacity to the board’s december 2014 approval authorizing management at its discretion to repurchase up to 300000 of common shares thereby increasing the total repurchase authorization to 500000 approximately 118971 remained available for share repurchases as of october 31 2017 the repurchase program is funded using cash from operations and proceeds from borrowings under our credit facilities timing and actual number of shares subject to repurchase are contingent on a number of factors including levels of cash generation from operations cash requirements for acquisitions repayment of debt and our share price we intend to focus on capital expenditures for 2018 on continued investments in our information systems and projects that improve both capacity and efficiency of manufacturing and distribution operations

effects of foreign currency

the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on sales and operating results cannot be precisely measured due to fluctuating selling prices sales volume product mix and cost structures in each country where we operate as a general rule a weakening of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies has a favorable effect on sales and net income while a strengthening of the dollar has a detrimental effect

in 2017 as compared with 2016 the united states dollar was generally stronger against foreign currencies if 2016 exchange rates had been in effect during 2017 sales would have been approximately 8210 higher and thirdparty costs would have been approximately 5791 higher in 2016 as compared with 2015 the united states dollar was generally stronger against foreign currencies if 2015 exchange rates had been in effect during 2016 sales would have been approximately 23249 higher and thirdparty costs would have been approximately 8332 higher these effects on reported sales do not include the impact of local price adjustments made in response to changes in currency exchange rates

inflation 

inflation affects profit margins as the ability to pass cost increases on to customers is restricted by the need for competitive pricing although inflation has been modest in recent years and has had no material effect on the years covered by these financial statements we continue to seek ways to minimize the impact of inflation through focused efforts to increase productivity

trends

the fiveyear summary in item 6 documents our historical financial trends over this period the world’s economic conditions fluctuated significantly our solid performance is attributed to our participation in diverse geographic and industrial markets and our longterm commitment to develop and provide quality products and worldwide service to meet our customers’ changing needs

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

we operate internationally and enter into intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies consequently we are subject to market risk arising from exchange rate movements between the dates foreign currencies are recorded and the dates they are settled we regularly use foreign exchange contracts to reduce our risks related to most of these transactions these contracts primarily associated with the euro yen and pound sterling typically have maturities of 90 days or less and generally require the exchange of foreign currencies for united states dollars at rates stated in the contracts gains and losses from changes in the market value of these contracts offset foreign exchange losses and gains respectively on the underlying transactions other transactions denominated in foreign currencies are designated as hedges of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries or are intercompany transactions of a longterm investment nature as a result of the use of foreign exchange contracts on a routine basis to reduce the risks related to most of our transactions denominated in foreign currencies as of october 31 2017 we did not have material foreign currency exposure

senior operating executives supervise an extensive quality control program for our equipment machinery and systems and manufacturing processes

natural gas and other fuels are our primary energy sources however standby capacity for alternative sources is available if needed




 item 1a ri sk factor s 

in an enterprise as diverse as ours a wide range of factors could affect future performance we discuss in this section some of the risk factors that if they actually occurred could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition value and results of operations you should consider these risk factors in connection with evaluating the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k because these factors could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected in forwardlooking statements

the significant risk factors affecting our operations include the following

changes in united states or international economic conditions could adversely affect the profitability of any of our operations

in 2016 approximately 29 percent of our revenue was generated in the united states while approximately 71 percent was generated outside the united states our largest markets include appliance automotive construction container electronics assembly food and beverage furniture medical metal finishing nonwovens packaging paper and paperboard converting plastics processing and semiconductor a slowdown in any of these specific end markets could directly affect our revenue stream and profitability

a portion of our product sales is attributable to industries and markets such as the semiconductor mobile electronics polymer processing and metal finishing industries which historically have been cyclical and sensitive to relative changes in supply and demand and general economic conditions the demand for our products depends in part on the general economic conditions of the industries or national economies of our customers downward economic cycles in our customers’ industries or countries may reduce sales of some of our products it is not possible to predict accurately the factors that will affect demand for our products in the future

any significant downturn in the health of the general economy globally regionally or in the markets in which we sell products could have an adverse effect on our revenues and financial performance resulting in impairment of assets

significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates or change in monetary policy may harm our financial results

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly with respect to the euro the yen the pound sterling and the chinese yuan any significant change in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business against the united states dollar could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for additional detail related to this risk see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk

the majority of our consolidated revenues in 2016 were generated in currencies other than the united states dollar which is our reporting currency we recognize foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from our operations in the period incurred as a result currency fluctuations between the united states dollar and the currencies in which we do business have caused and will continue to cause foreign currency transaction and translation gains and losses which historically have been material and could continue to be material we cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future operating results because of the number of currencies involved the variability of currency exposures and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates we take actions to manage our foreign currency exposure such as entering into hedging transactions where available but we cannot assure that our strategies will adequately protect our consolidated operating results from the effects of exchange rate fluctuations for example the announcement of brexit caused volatility in global currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the united states dollar against foreign currencies in which we conduct business future adverse consequences arising from brexit may include continued volatility in exchange rates any significant fluctuation in exchange rates may be harmful to our financial condition and results of operations we also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into united states dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or customers located in or conducting business in a country imposing controls currency devaluations diminish the united states dollar value of the currency of the country instituting the devaluation and if they occur or continue for significant periods could adversely affect our earnings or cash flow

if we fail to develop new products or our customers do not accept the new products we develop our revenue and profitability could be adversely impacted

innovation is critical to our success we believe that we must continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and manufacture new products with improved capabilities in order to continue to be a leading provider of precision technology solutions for the industrial equipment market we also believe that we must continue to make improvements in our productivity in order to maintain our competitive position difficulties or delays in research development or production of new products or failure to gain market acceptance of new products and technologies may reduce future sales and adversely affect our competitive position we 

nordson corporation 10 

 

continue to invest in the development and marketing of new products there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resou rces to make such investments that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses if we fail to make innovations launch products with quality problems or the market does not accept our new products our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected in addition as new or enhanced products are introduced we must successfully manage the transit ion from older products to minimize disruption in customers’ ordering patterns avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that we can deliver sufficient supplies of new products to meet customers’ demands 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions and we may not be able to execute on our acquisition strategy or integrate acquisitions successfully

our recent historical growth has depended and our future growth is likely to continue to depend in part on our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses into our existing operations we intend to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world we cannot assure we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition opportunities prevail against competing potential acquirers negotiate appropriate acquisition terms obtain financing that may be needed to consummate such acquisitions complete proposed acquisitions successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new markets in addition we cannot assure that any acquisition once successfully integrated will perform as planned be accretive to earnings or prove to be beneficial to our operations and cash flow

the success of our acquisition strategy is subject to other risks and uncertainties including















in addition an acquisition could adversely impact our operating performance as a result of the incurrence of acquisitionrelated debt preacquisition potential tax liabilities acquisition expenses the amortization of acquisitionacquired assets or possible future impairments of goodwill or intangible assets associated with the acquisition

we may also face liability with respect to acquired businesses for violations of environmental laws occurring prior to the date of our acquisition and some or all of these liabilities may not be covered by environmental insurance secured to mitigate the risk or by indemnification from the sellers from which we acquired these businesses we could also incur significant costs including but not limited to remediation costs natural resources damages civil or criminal fines and sanctions and thirdparty claims as a result of past or future violations of or liabilities associated with environmental laws

increased it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems networks products solutions and services

increased global it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including employee training comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems our systems networks products solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats depending on their nature and scope such threats could potentially lead to the compromising of confidential information including but not limited to confidential information relating to customer or employee data improper use of our systems and networks manipulation and destruction of data defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions which in turn could adversely affect our reputation competitiveness and results of operations

nordson corporation 11 

 

if our intellectual property protection is inadequate others may be able to use our technologies and tradenames and thereby reduce our ability to compete which could have a material adverse effect on us our financial condition and results of operations 

we regard much of the technology underlying our products and the trademarks under which we market our products as proprietary the steps we take to protect our proprietary technology may be inadequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or third parties may independently develop similar technology we rely on a combination of patents trademark copyright and trade secret laws employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and other contracts to establish and protect our technology and other intellectual property rights the agreements may be breached or terminated and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach and existing trade secrets patent and copyright law afford us limited protection policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult a third party could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization litigation may be necessary for us to defend against claims of infringement or to protect our intellectual property rights and could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our efforts further we might not prevail in such litigation which could harm our business

our products could infringe on the intellectual property of others which may cause us to engage in costly litigation and if we are not successful could cause us to pay substantial damages and prohibit us from selling our products

third parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us based on their patents or other intellectual property claims and we may have to pay substantial damages possibly including treble damages if it is ultimately determined our products infringe we may have to obtain a license to sell our products if it is determined that our products infringe upon another party’s intellectual property we might be prohibited from selling our products before we obtain a license which if available at all may require us to pay substantial royalties even if infringement claims against us are without merit defending these types of lawsuits takes significant time may be expensive and may divert management attention from other business concerns

any impairment in the value of our intangible assets including goodwill would negatively affect our operating results and total capitalization

our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets primarily goodwill the goodwill results from our acquisitions and represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the identifiable net assets we acquired we assess at least annually whether there has been any impairment in the value of our intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels if competing or alternative technologies emerge if market conditions for acquired businesses decline if significant and prolonged negative industry or economic trends exist if our stock price and market capitalization declines or if future cash flow estimates decline we could incur under current applicable accounting rules a noncash charge to operating earnings for goodwill impairment any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and equity book value the effect of which could be material

we may be exposed to liabilities under the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa which could have a material adverse effect on our business

we are subject to compliance with various laws and regulations including the fcpa and similar worldwide antibribery and anticorruption laws which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or making other improper payments to private or public parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining an unfair business advantage the fcpa also requires proper record keeping and characterization of such payments in our reports filed with the sec our employees are trained and required to comply with these laws and we are committed to legal compliance and corporate ethics violations of these laws could result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and financial penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition or results of operations 

inability to access capital could impede growth or the repayment or refinancing of existing indebtedness

the limits imposed on us by the restrictive covenants contained in our credit facilities could prevent us from making acquisitions or cause us to lose access to these facilities

our existing credit facilities contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to among other things









nordson corporation 12 

 

in addition our credit facilities require us to meet financial ratios including a “leverage ratio” and an “interest coverage ratio” both as defined in the credit facilities 

these restrictions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs and could otherwise restrict our financing activities

our ability to comply with the covenants and other terms of our credit facilities will depend on our future operating performance if we fail to comply with such covenants and terms we may be in default and the maturity of the related debt could be accelerated and become immediately due and payable we may be required to obtain waivers from our lenders in order to maintain compliance under our credit facilities including waivers with respect to our compliance with certain financial covenants if we are unable to obtain necessary waivers and the debt under our credit facilities is accelerated we would be required to obtain replacement financing at prevailing market rates

we may need new or additional financing in the future to expand our business or refinance existing indebtedness if we are unable to access capital on satisfactory terms and conditions we may not be able to expand our business or meet our payment requirements under our existing credit facilities our ability to obtain new or additional financing will depend on a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control we may not be able to obtain new or additional financing because we have substantial debt or because we may not have sufficient cash flow to service or repay our existing or future debt in addition depending on market conditions and our financial performance neither debt nor equity financing may be available on satisfactory terms or at all finally as a consequence of worsening financial market conditions our credit facility providers may not provide the agreed credit if they become undercapitalized

changes in interest rates could adversely affect us

any period of interest rate increases may also adversely affect our profitability at october 31 2016 we had 984787 of total debt and notes payable outstanding of which 64 percent was priced at interest rates that float with the market a one percent increase in the interest rate on the floating rate debt in 2016 would have resulted in approximately 7205 of additional interest expense a higher level of floating rate debt would increase the exposure to changes in interest rates for additional detail related to this risk see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk

failure to retain our existing senior management team or the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could hurt our business and inhibit our ability to operate and grow successfully

our success will continue to depend to a significant extent on the continued service of our executive management team and the ability to recruit hire and retain other key management personnel to support our growth and operational initiatives and replace executives who retire or resign failure to retain our leadership team and attract and retain other important management and technical personnel could place a constraint on our global growth and operational initiatives possibly resulting in inefficient and ineffective management and operations which would likely harm our revenues operations and product development efforts and eventually result in a decrease in profitability

the level of returns on pension plan assets and changes in the actuarial assumptions used could adversely affect us

our operating results may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of expense we record for our defined benefit pension plans us gaap requires that we calculate pension expense using actuarial valuations which are dependent upon our various assumptions including estimates of expected longterm rate of return on plan assets discount rates for future payment obligations and the expected rate of increase in future compensation levels our pension expense and funding requirements may also be affected by our actual return on plan assets and by legislation and other government regulatory actions changes in assumptions laws or regulations could lead to variability in operating results and could have a material adverse impact on liquidity

regulations related to conflictfree minerals may result in additional expenses that could affect our financial condition and business operations

pursuant to the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the sec promulgated final rules regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals known as conflict minerals which are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries as well as procedures regarding a manufacturer’s efforts to prevent the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from those minerals these new disclosure obligations will require continuing due diligence efforts to support our future disclosure requirements we incurred and will continue to incur costs associated with complying with such disclosure requirements including costs associated with canvassing our supply chain to determine the source country of any conflict minerals incorporated in our products in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities in addition the implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products

political conditions in foreign countries in which we operate could adversely affect us 

we conduct our manufacturing sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and are subject to risks associated with doing business outside the united states in 2016 approximately 71 percent of our total sales were generated outside the united states we expect that international operations and united states export sales will continue to be important to our business for the foreseeable future both sales from international operations and export sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside the united states such risks include but are not limited to the following



















any of these events could reduce the demand for our products limit the prices at which we can sell our products interrupt our supply chain or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operating performance

our international operations also depend upon favorable trade relations between the us and those foreign countries in which our customers subcontractors and materials suppliers have operations a protectionist trade environment in either the us or those foreign countries in which we do business such as a change in the current tariff structures export compliance or other trade policies may materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our products in foreign markets

our business and operating results may be adversely affected by natural disasters or other catastrophic events beyond our control

while we have taken precautions to prevent production and service interruptions at our global facilities severe weather conditions such as hurricanes or tornadoes as well major earthquakes and other natural disasters in areas in which we have manufacturing facilities or from which we obtain products may cause physical damage to our properties closure of one or more of our manufacturing or distribution facilities lack of an adequate work force in a market temporary disruption in the supply of inventory disruption in the transport of products and utilities and delays in the delivery of products to our customers any of these factors may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

the insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures

we maintain property business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered we are potentially at risk if one or more of our insurance carriers fail additionally severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the ratings and survival of some insurers in the future we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain

 item 3 legal proceedings

we are involved in pending or potential litigation regarding environmental product liability patent contract employee and other matters arising from the normal course of business including the environmental matter discussed below after consultation with legal counsel we believe that the probability is remote that losses in excess of the amounts we have accrued would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition quarterly or annual operating results or cash flows

environmental – we have voluntarily agreed with the city of new richmond wisconsin and other potentially responsible parties to share costs associated with the remediation of the city of new richmond municipal landfill the “site” and constructing a potable water delivery system serving the impacted area down gradient of the site at october 31 2016 and 2015 our accrual for the ongoing operation maintenance and monitoring obligation at the site was 516 and 565 respectively 

the liability for environmental remediation represents management’s best estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable undiscounted costs related to known remediation obligations the accuracy of our estimate of environmental liability is affected by several uncertainties such as additional requirements that may be identified in connection with remedial activities the complexity and evolution of environmental laws and regulations and the identification of presently unknown remediation requirements consequently our liability could be different than our current estimate however we do not expect that the costs associated with remediation will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

critical accounting policies and estimates

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses on an ongoing basis we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that are used to prepare financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates used by management

certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below on a regular basis critical accounting policies are reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors

revenue recognition – most of our revenues are recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the sales price is fixed or determinable collectibility is reasonably assured and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer certain arrangements may include installation installation supervision training and spare parts which tend to be completed in a short period of time at an insignificant cost and utilizing skills not unique to us and therefore are typically regarded as inconsequential or perfunctory revenue for undelivered items is deferred and included within accrued liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet revenues deferred in 2016 2015 and 2014 were not material 

translation of foreign currency financial statements and foreign currency transactions – our reporting currency is the us dollar however the functional currency for each of our foreign subsidiaries is its principal operating currency we translate the amounts included in our consolidated statements of income from our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars at weightedaverage exchange rates which we believe are representative of the actual exchange rates on the dates of the transactions our foreign subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars from local currency at the actual exchange rates as of the end of each reporting date and we record the resulting foreign exchange translation adjustments in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss if the us dollar strengthens we reflect the resulting losses as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss conversely if the us dollar weakens foreign exchange translation gains result which favorably impact accumulated other comprehensive income loss translation adjustments may be included in net earnings in the event of a sale or liquidation of certain of our underlying foreign investments if we determine that the functional currency of any of our foreign subsidiaries should be the us dollar our financial statements will be affected should this occur we will adjust our reporting to appropriately account for any such changes 

as appropriate we use permanently invested intercompany loans as a source of capital to reduce exposure to foreign currency fluctuations at our foreign subsidiaries these loans on a consolidated basis are treated as being analogous to equity for accounting purposes therefore foreign exchange gains or losses on these intercompany loans are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss

goodwill – goodwill is the excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in various business combinations goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level or more often if indications of impairment exist our reporting units are the adhesive dispensing systems segment the industrial coating systems segment and one level below the advanced technology systems segment 

we test goodwill in accordance with accounting standards codification asc 350 the goodwill impairment test is a twostep process in the first step performed in the fourth quarter of each year we estimate a reporting unit’s fair value using a combination of the discounted cash flow method of the income approach and the guideline public company method of the market approach and compare the result against the reporting unit’s carrying value of net assets if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value then a second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired we use an independent valuation specialist to assist with 

nordson corporation 20 

 

refining our assumptions and methods used to determine fair values using these methods in step one the discounted cash flow method uses assumptions for revenue growth operating margin and working capital turnover that are based on general management’s strategic plans tempered by performance trends and reasonable expectations about those trends terminal value calculations employ a published formula known as the gordon growth model method that essentially captures the present value of perpetual cash flows beyond the last projected period assuming a constant weighted average cost of capital wacc methodology and growth rate for each reporting unit a sensitivity analysis is performed to vary the discount and terminal growth rates in order to provide a range of reasonableness for detecting impairment 

discount rates are developed using a wacc methodology the wacc represents the blended average required rate of return for equity and debt capital based on observed market return data and company specific risk factors for 2016 the discount rates used ranged from 9 percent to 15 percent depending upon the reporting units size end market volatility and projection risk the calculated internal rate of return for the discounted cash flow method was 10 percent the same as the calculated wacc for total nordson in the application of the guideline public company method fair value is determined using transactional evidence for similar publicly traded equity the comparable company guideline group is determined based on relative similarities to each reporting unit since exact correlations are not available an indication of fair value for each reporting unit is based on the placement of each reporting unit within a range of multiples determined for its comparable guideline company group valuation multiples are derived by dividing latest twelve month performance for revenues and ebitda into total invested capital which is the sum of traded equity plus interest bearing debt less cash these multiples are applied against the revenue and ebitda of each reporting unit while the implied indications of fair value using the guideline public company method yield meaningful results the discounted cash flow method of the income approach includes management’s thoughtful projections and insights as to what the reporting units will accomplish in the near future accordingly the reasonable implied fair value of each reporting unit is a blend based on the relative strength of the approaches employed

to test the reasonableness of the aggregate fair value we performed the control premium test which compares the sum of the implied fair values calculated for our reporting units net of debt to the market value of equity the control premium was 1 percent as of the test date of august 1 2016 and a slight discount to the market value of equity as of october 31 2016 the control premium indicated that the discounted cash flow valuation was reasonable 

in 2016 and 2015 the results of our step one testing indicated no impairment therefore the second step of impairment testing was not necessary

the excess of fair value fv over carrying value cv was compared to the carrying value for each reporting unit based on the results shown in the table below and based on our measurement date of august 1 2016 our conclusion is that no indicators of impairment exist in 2016 potential events or circumstances such as a sustained downturn in global economies could have a negative effect on estimated fair values

 



 

the table above does not include acquisitions that occurred after the august 1 measurement date but before our fiscal yearend we acquired linktech tm quick couplings inc “linktech” on september 1 2016 determination of the preliminary goodwill associated with this acquisition was completed with the assistance of an independent valuation specialist in the fourth quarter of 2016 since the date of the valuation no events or changes in circumstances have occurred that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the acquisition below its carrying value for future valuation purposes linktech will be included in the advanced technology systems – fluid management reporting unit

other longlived assets – we test other depreciable and amortizable longlived assets for recoverability in accordance with asc 360 using undiscounted cash flows if indicators of impairment exist the total carrying value of longlived assets for each reporting unit is compared to the forecasted cash flows of each reporting unit’s longlived assets being tested cash flows have been defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization less annual maintenance capital spending

inventor ies  inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market cost was determined using the lastin firstout lifo method for 20 percent of consolidated inventories at october 31 2016 and october 31 2015 with the firstin firstout fifo method used for the remaining inventory on an ongoing basis inventory is tested for technical obsolescence as well as for future demand and changes in market conditions we have historically maintained inventory reserves to reflect those conditions when the cost o f inventory is not expected to be recovered reserves are also maintained for inventory used for demonstration purposes the inventory reserve balance was 29324 28230 and 26744 at october 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

pension plans and postretirement medical plans  the measurement of liabilities related to our pension plans and postretirement medical plans is based on management’s assumptions related to future factors including interest rates return on pension plan assets compensation increases mortality and turnover assumptions and health care cost trend rates 

the weightedaverage discount rate used to determine the present value of our domestic pension plan obligations was 394 percent at october 31 2016 and 439 percent at october 31 2015 the weightedaverage discount rate used to determine the present value of our various international pension plan obligations was 186 percent at october 31 2016 compared to 281 percent at october 31 2015 the discount rates used for all plans were determined by using quality fixed income investments with a duration period approximately equal to the period over which pension obligations are expected to be settled

in determining the expected return on plan assets we consider both historical performance and an estimate of future longterm rates of return on assets similar to those in our plans we consult with and consider the opinions of financial and actuarial experts in developing appropriate return assumptions the expected rate of return longterm investment rate on domestic pension assets used to determine net benefit costs was 672 percent in 2016 and 676 percent in 2015 the average expected rate of return on international pension assets used to determine net benefit costs was 422 percent in 2016 and 439 percent in 2015

the assumed rate of compensation increases used to determine the present value of our domestic pension plan obligations was 361 percent at october 31 2016 compared to 350 percent at october 31 2015 the assumed rate of compensation increases used to determine the present value of our international pension plan obligations was 312 percent at october 31 2016 compared to 322 percent at october 31 2015

annual expense amounts are determined based on the discount rate used at the end of the prior year differences between actual and assumed investment returns on pension plan assets result in actuarial gains or losses that are amortized into expense over a period of years

economic assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported the effect of a one percent change in the discount rate expected return on assets and compensation increase is shown in the table below bracketed numbers represent decreases in expense and obligation amounts

 



 

with respect to the domestic postretirement medical plan the discount rate used to value the benefit plan was 405 percent at october 31 2016 and 450 percent at october 31 2015 the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the health care cost trend rate is assumed to be 363 percent in 2017 decreasing gradually to 324 percent in 2026

for the international postretirement plan the discount rate used to value the benefit obligation was 340 percent at october 31 2016 and 435 percent at october 31 2015 the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the health care cost trend rate is assumed to be 613 percent in 2017 decreasing gradually to 350 percent in 2031 

nordson corporation 22 

 

the discount rate and the health care cost trend rate assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported for example a onepercentage point change in the discount rate and the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects bracketed numbers represent decreases in expense and obligation amounts 

 



 

employees hired after january 1 2002 are not eligible to participate in the domestic postretirement medical plan 

in the fourth quarter of 2016 we adopted a change in the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans historically for the vast majority of our plans the service and interest cost components were estimated using a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period beginning in 2017 we will use a spot rate approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows in the estimation of the service and interest components of benefit cost resulting in a more precise measurement this change does not affect the measurement of total benefit obligations the change will be accounted for as a change in estimate that is inseparable from a change in accounting principle and accordingly will be accounted for prospectively starting in 2017 the reductions in service and interest costs for 2017 associated with this change are expected to be 1100 and 3700 respectively

pension and postretirement expenses in 2017 are expected to be approximately 1211 lower than 2016 primarily due to the adoption of the spot rate approach as noted above 

income taxes – income taxes are estimated based on income for financial reporting purposes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes and certain changes in valuation allowances we provide valuation allowances against deferred tax assets if based on available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

management believes the valuation allowances are adequate after considering future taxable income allowable carryforward periods and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize the deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount including the valuation allowance an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made conversely should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be expensed in the period such determination was made

further at each interim reporting period we estimate an effective income tax rate that is expected to be applicable for the full year significant judgment is involved regarding the application of global income tax laws and regulations and when projecting the jurisdictional mix of income additionally interpretation of tax laws court decisions or other guidance provided by taxing authorities influences our estimate of the effective income tax rates as a result our actual effective income tax rates and related income tax liabilities may differ materially from our estimated effective tax rates and related income tax liabilities any resulting differences are recorded in the period they become known

nordson corporation 23 

 

financial instruments  assets liabilities and commitments that are to be settled in cash and are denominated in foreign currencies are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates we enter into foreign currency forward contracts which are derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of foreign currency exposures resulting from the collection of receivables payables and loans denominated in foreign currencies the maturities of these contracts are usually less than 90 days forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and therefore are marked to market each accounting period and the resulting gains or losses are included in “other–net” within other income expense in the consoli dated statement of income 

warranties  we provide customers with a product warranty that requires us to repair or replace defective products within a specified period of time generally one year from the date of delivery or first use an accrual is recorded for expected warranty costs for products shipped through the end of each accounting period in determining the amount of the accrual we rely primarily on historical warranty claims amounts charged to the warranty reserve were 14487 12531 and 10813 in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively the reserve balance was 11770 10537 and 9918 at october 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

performance share incentive awards  executive officers and selected other key employees are eligible to receive share awards with payouts based on corporate financial performance over threeyear periods award payouts vary based on the degree to which corporate financial performance equals or exceeds predetermined threshold target and maximum performance levels at the end of a performance period no award payout will occur unless certain threshold performance levels are equaled or exceeded the amount of compensation expense is based upon current performance projections for each threeyear performance period and the percentage of the requisite service that has been rendered the calculations are also based upon the grant date fair value determined using the closing market price of nordson common stock at the grant date reduced by the implied value of dividends not to be paid awards are recorded as capital in excess of stated value in shareholders’ equity the cumulative amount recorded at october 31 2016 for the plans originating in 2014 2015 and 2016 was 10951 compensation expense attributable to all performance share incentive award periods for executive officers and selected other key employees for 2016 2015 and 2014 was 7083 3459 and 4304 respectively 

2016 compared to 2015

sales – worldwide sales for 2016 were 1808994 an increase of 71 percent from 2015 sales of 1688666 sales volume increased 85 percent and unfavorable currency translation effects reduced sales by 14 percent the volume increase consisted of 65 percent from organic growth and 20 percent from acquisitions we had one acquisition during 2016 linktech which is included within the advanced technology systems segment three acquisitions were made during 2015 liquidyn gmbh “liquidyn” and matrix technologies gmbh “matrix” which were included within the advanced technology systems segment and wafo produktionsgesellschaft gmbh “wafo” which was included in the adhesives dispensing systems segment as used throughout this form 10k geographic regions include the americas canada mexico and central and south america asia pacific excluding japan europe japan and the united states 

sales of the adhesive dispensing systems segment were 879573 in 2016 an increase of 43507 or 52 percent from 2015 sales of 836066 the increase was the net result of a sales volume increase of 69 percent partially offset by unfavorable currency effects that reduced sales by 17 percent the sales volume increase consisted of 07 percent from the wafo acquisition and 62 percent from organic volume within this segment sales volume increased in all geographic regions except for the americas and japan and was particularly strong in europe organic growth was driven by product lines serving consumer nondurable disposable hygiene general product assembly rigid packaging and polymer processing end markets 

sales of the advanced technology systems segment were 676329 in 2016 an increase of 82471 or 139 percent from 2015 sales of 593858 the increase was the result of a sales volume increase of 147 percent partially offset by unfavorable currency effects that reduced sales by 08 percent the sales volume increase consisted of 101 percent from organic volume and 46 percent from the firstyear effect of acquisitions within the segment sales volume inclusive of acquisitions increased in all geographic regions and was most pronounced in japan and asia pacific growth was driven by increased demand for test and inspection and automated dispensing solutions serving electronics end markets as well continued strength in fluid management product lines serving medical and industrial end markets

sales of the industrial coating systems segment were 253092 in 2016 a decrease of 5650 or 22 percent from 2015 sales of 258742 the decrease was the result of a sales volume decrease of 06 percent and unfavorable currency effects that reduced sales by 16 percent within this segment sales volume increased in the americas and asia pacific regions and was offset by decreases in the united states europe and japan growth in cold material product lines serving automotive end markets was offset by softness in powder coating and container product lines serving industrial end markets 

nordson corporation 24 

 

sales outside the united states accounted for 706 percent of our sales in 2016 as compar ed to 686 percent in 2015 on a geographic basis sales in the united states were 531117 an increase of 02 percent from 2015 the increase in sales volume consisted of 04 percent from acquisitions offset by an organic volume decline of 02 percent in the americas region sales were 124657 a decrease of 36 percent from 2015 with volume increasing 25 percent offset by unfavorable currency effects of 61 percent the increase in sales volume consisted of 17 percent from organic volume and 08 pe rcent from acquisitions sales in europe were 503869 an increase of 89 percent from 2015 with volume increasing 123 percent partially offset by unfavorable currency effects of 34 percent the increase in sales volume consisted of 92 percent from or ganic volume and 31 percent from acquisitions sales in japan were 122054 an increase of 132 percent from 2015 with volume increasing 22 percent and favorable currency effects of 110 percent the increase in sales volume consisted of 19 percent fr om organic volume and 03 percent from acquisitions sales in the asia pacific region were 527297 an increase of 149 percent from the prior year with volume increasing 174 percent partially offset by unfavorable currency effects of 25 percent the i ncrease in sales volume consisted of 140 percent from organic growth and 34 percent from acquisitions 

it is estimated that the effect of pricing on total revenue was not material relative to 2015

operating profit – cost of sales were 815495 in 2016 up 53 percent from 2015 gross profit expressed as a percentage of sales increased to 549 percent in 2016 from 541 percent in 2015 of the 08 percentage point improvement in gross margin favorable product mix added 13 percentage points primarily related to higher sales growth in our adhesive dispensing systems and advanced technology systems segments which have higher margins relative to our industrial coating systems segment the 05 percentage point offset is primarily due to unfavorable currency translation effects 

selling and administrative expenses were 594293 in 2016 compared to 584823 in 2015 the 16 percent increase includes 29 percent primarily in support of higher sales growth offset by 13 percent due to currency translation effects

selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to 329 percent in 2016 from 346 percent in 2015 the 17 percentage point improvement is primarily due to leveraging higher sales growth in our adhesive dispensing systems and advanced technology systems segments 

severance and restructuring costs of 10775 were recorded in 2016 within the adhesives dispensing systems segment restructuring initiatives to optimize operations in the us and belgium and consolidate certain polymer processing product line facilities in the us resulted in severance and restructuring costs of 7800 to enhance operational efficiency and customer service within the advanced technology systems segment a restructuring initiative resulted in severance and restructuring costs of 1054 within the industrial coatings systems segment a restructuring program to enhance operational efficiency and customer service resulted in severance costs of 1921 additional costs related to these initiatives are not expected to be material in future periods all severance and restructuring costs are included in selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income 

operating capacity for each of our segments can support fluctuations in order activity without significant changes in operating costs also currency translation affects reported operating margins operating margins for each segment were unfavorably impacted by a stronger dollar primarily against the british pound and chinese yuan during 2016 as compared to 2015

operating profit as a percentage of sales increased to 215 percent in 2016 compared to 188 percent in 2015 of the 27 percentage point improvement in operating margin favorable leverage of our selling and administrative expenses contributed 18 percentage points favorable product mix added 13 percentage points primarily related to higher sales growth in our adhesives dispensing systems and advanced technology systems segments which have higher margins relative to our industrial coating systems segment and lower severance and restructuring expenses contributed 01 percentage points the 05 percentage point offset is primarily due to unfavorable currency translation effects

for the adhesive dispensing systems segment operating profit as a percentage of sales increased to 261 percent in 2016 compared to 234 percent in 2015 of the 27 percentage point improvement in operating margin favorable leverage of our selling and administrative expenses contributed 20 percentage points favorable product mix added 12 percentage points due to increased sales to consumer nondurable disposable hygiene general product assembly and rigid packaging end markets and lower severance and restructuring expense added 01 percentage points the 06 percentage point offset is primarily due to unfavorable currency translation effects

see note 10 for additional information









we believe that the combination of present capital resources cash from operations and unused financing sources are more than adequate to meet cash requirements for 2017 there are no significant restrictions limiting the transfer of funds from international subsidiaries to the parent company

outlook

our operating performance balance sheet position and financial ratios for 2016 remained strong relative to recent years although uncertainties persisted in global financial markets and the general economic environment going forward we are wellpositioned to manage our liquidity needs that arise from working capital requirements capital expenditures contributions related to pension and postretirement obligations and principal and interest payments on indebtedness primary sources of capital to meet these needs as well as other opportunistic investments are cash provided by operations and borrowings under our loan agreements in 2016 cash from operations was 183 percent of revenue with respect to borrowing under existing loan agreements as of october 31 2016 we had 355320 available capacity under our fiveyear term 600000 unsecured multicurrency credit facility which may be increased to 850000 under certain conditions this credit facility expires in february 2020 in addition we had 42778 borrowing capacity remaining on our 200000 threeyear private shelf agreement with new york life investment management llc while these facilities provide the contractual terms for any borrowing we cannot be assured that these facilities would be available in the event that these financial institutions failed to remain sufficiently capitalized

other loan agreements exist with no remaining borrowing capacity but factor into debt covenant calculations that affect future borrowing capacity in july 2012 we entered into a note purchase agreement with a group of insurance companies under which we sold 200000 of senior notes the notes mature between july 2017 and july 2025 and bear interest at fixed rates between 227 percent and 313 percent as of april 2015 we entered into a 200000 term loan facility with pnc bank 100000 is due in three years and has an interest rate spread of 1 percent over libor and 100000 is due in five years and has an interest rate spread of 11 percent over libor in july 2015 we entered into a note purchase agreement under which 100000 of senior unsecured notes were purchased primarily by a group of insurance companies the notes consist of two tranches series a and b at 50000 each maturing in july 2025 and july 2027 and bearing interest at fixed rates of 289 percent and 319 percent respectively in october 2015 we entered into a €70000 three year term loan agreement with bank of america merrill lynch international in london this agreement was amended in september 2016 to extend the term by one year and increase the principal balance the balance of this loan at october 31 2016 was €72300 the interest rate is variable based on the libor rate plus applicable margin based on our leverage ratio and was 0875 percent over libor at october 31 2016

respective to all of these loans are two primary covenants the le verage ratio that restricts indebtedness net of cash to a maximum 350 times consolidated fourquarter trailing ebitda and the interest coverage ratio that requires fourquarter trailing ebitda to be at minimum 30 times consolidated trailing fourquarte r interest expense debt ebitda and interest expense are as defined in respective credit agreements with respect to these two primary covenants as of october 31 2016 we were approximately 54 percent of the most restrictive leverage ratio and appro ximately 13 percent of the most restrictive interest coverage ratio unused borrowing capacity under existing loan agreements would amount to an additional 23 percent of the most restrictive leverage ratio 

regarding expectations for 2017 we are optimistic about longer term growth opportunities in the diverse consumer durable nondurable medical electronics and industrial end markets we serve however we move forward in the nearterm with caution given continued slow growth in emerging markets expectations for global gdp indicating a lowgrowth macroeconomic environment and marketplace effects of political instability in certain areas of the world with respect to the united kingdom’s uk expected exit brexit from the european union eu resulting effects upon markets we serve and tax jurisdictions in which we operate will depend upon terms of agreements the uk makes to retain access to eu markets during the nearterm and more permanently and also to national laws and regulations that may replace and diverge from eu laws and regulations until more specific details are determined the economic and political uncertainty in the uk and eu likely will continue along with implications upon the global economy while the announcement of brexit initially resulted in significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange markets the interim effects at this time upon the way we do business and results from operations have not been material 

though the pace of improvement in the global economy remains unclear our growth potential has been demonstrated over time from our capacity to build and enhance our core businesses by entering emerging markets and pursuing market adjacencies we drive value for our customers through our application expertise differentiated technology and direct sales and service support our priorities also are focused on operational efficiencies by employing continuous improvement methodologies in our business processes we expect our efforts will continue to provide more than sufficient cash from operations for meeting our liquidity needs and paying dividends to common shareholders as well as enabling us to invest in the development of new applications and markets for our technologies cash from operations have been 16 to 19 percent of revenues over the past five years resulting in more than sufficient cash for our ordinary business requirements we believe our cash provided from operations and available borrowing capacity will enable us to make other opportunistic investments in our own common shares and strategic business combinations 

with respect to contractual spending the table above presents our financial obligations as 1212488 of which 171380 is payable in 2017 in august 2015 the board of directors approved a 200000 common share repurchase program that added capacity to the board’s december 2014 approval authorizing management at its discretion to repurchase shares up to 300000 approximately 118971 remained available for share repurchases as of october 31 2016 the repurchase program is funded using cash from operations and proceeds from borrowings under our credit facilities timing and actual number of shares subject to repurchase are contingent on a number of factors including levels of cash generation from operations cash requirements for acquisitions repayment of debt and our share price capital expenditures for 2017 will be focused on continued investments in our information systems and projects that improve both capacity and efficiency of manufacturing and distribution operations

effects of foreign currency

the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on sales and operating results cannot be precisely measured due to fluctuating selling prices sales volume product mix and cost structures in each country where we operate as a general rule a weakening of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies has a favorable effect on sales and net income while a strengthening of the dollar has a detrimental effect

in 2016 as compared with 2015 the united states dollar was generally stronger against foreign currencies if 2015 exchange rates had been in effect during 2016 sales would have been approximately 23249 higher and thirdparty costs would have been approximately 8332 higher in 2015 as compared with 2014 the united states dollar was stronger against foreign currencies if 2014 exchange rates had been in effect during 2015 sales would have been approximately 114844 higher and thirdparty costs would have been approximately 67414 higher these effects on reported sales do not include the impact of local price adjustments made in response to changes in currency exchange rates

inflation

inflation affects profit margins as the ability to pass cost increases on to customers is restricted by the need for competitive pricing although inflation has been modest in recent years and has had no material effect on the years covered by these financial statements we continue to seek ways to minimize the impact of inflation through focused efforts to increase productivity

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

we operate internationally and enter into intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies consequently we are subject to market risk arising from exchange rate movements between the dates foreign currencies are recorded and the dates they are settled we regularly use foreign exchange contracts to reduce our risks related to most of these transactions these contracts primarily associated with the euro yen and pound sterling typically have maturities of 90 days or less and generally require the exchange of foreign currencies for united states dollars at rates stated in the contracts gains and losses from changes in the market value of these contracts offset foreign exchange losses and gains respectively on the underlying transactions other transactions denominated in foreign currencies are designated as hedges of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries or are intercompany transactions of a longterm investment nature as a result of the use of foreign exchange contracts on a routine basis to reduce the risks related to most of our transactions denominated in foreign currencies as of october 31 2016 we did not have material foreign currency exposure

note 13 to the financial statements contains additional information about our foreign currency transactions and the methods and assumptions used to record these transactions

a portion of our operations is financed with shortterm and longterm borrowings and is subject to market risk arising from changes in interest rates

the tables that follow present principal repayments and weightedaverage interest rates on outstanding borrowings of fixedrate debt

 



 

we also have variablerate notes payable and longterm debt the weighted average interest rate of this debt was 16 percent at october 31 2016 and 12 percent at october 31 2015 a one percent increase in interest rates would have resulted in additional interest expense of approximately 7205 on the variable rate notes payable and longterm debt in 2016

senior operating executives supervise an extensive quality control program for our equipment machinery and systems

natural gas and other fuels are our primary energy sources however standby capacity for alternative sources is available if needed




 item 1a ri sk factors 

in an enterprise as diverse as ours a wide range of factors could affect future performance we discuss in this section some of the risk factors that if they actually occurred could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition value and results of operations you should consider these risk factors in connection with evaluating the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k because these factors could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected in forwardlooking statements

the significant risk factors affecting our operations include the following

changes in united states or international economic conditions could adversely affect the profitability of any of our operations

in 2015 approximately 31 percent of our revenue was generated in the united states while approximately 69 percent was generated outside the united states our largest markets include appliance automotive construction container electronics assembly food and beverage furniture medical metal finishing nonwovens packaging paper and paperboard converting plastics processing and semiconductor a slowdown in any of these specific end markets could directly affect our revenue stream and profitability

a portion of our product sales is attributable to industries and markets such as the semiconductor mobile electronics and metal finishing industries which historically have been cyclical and sensitive to relative changes in supply and demand and general economic conditions the demand for our products depends in part on the general economic conditions of the industries or national economies of our customers downward economic cycles in our customers’ industries or countries may reduce sales of some of our products it is not possible to predict accurately the factors that will affect demand for our products in the future

any significant downturn in the health of the general economy globally regionally or in the markets in which we sell products could have an adverse effect on our revenues and financial performance resulting in impairment of assets

significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates or change in monetary policy may harm our financial results

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly with respect to the euro the yen the pound sterling and the chinese yuan any significant change in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business against the united states dollar could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for additional detail related to this risk see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk

the majority of our consolidated revenues in 2015 were generated in currencies other than the united states dollar which is our reporting currency we recognize foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from our operations in the period incurred as a result currency fluctuations between the united states dollar and the currencies in which we do business have caused and will continue to cause foreign currency transaction and translation gains and losses which historically have been material and could continue to be material we cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future operating results because of the number of currencies involved the variability of currency exposures and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates we take actions to manage our foreign currency exposure such as entering into hedging transactions where available but we cannot assure that our strategies will adequately protect our consolidated operating results from the effects of exchange rate fluctuations

we also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into united states dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or customers located in or conducting business in a country imposing controls currency devaluations diminish the united states dollar value of the currency of the country instituting the devaluation and if they occur or continue for significant periods could adversely affect our earnings or cash flow

nordson corporation 9 

 

if we fail to develop new products or our customers do not accept the new products we develop our revenue and profitability could be adversely impacted 

innovation is critical to our success we believe that we must continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and manufacture new products with improved capabilities in order to continue to be a leading provider of precision technology solutions for the industrial equipment market we also believe that we must continue to make improvements in our productivity in order to maintain our competitive position difficulties or delays in research development or production of new products or failure to gain market acceptance of new products and technologies may reduce future sales and adversely affect our competitive position we continue to invest in the development and marketing of new products there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses if we fail to make innovations launch products with quality problems or the market does not accept our new products our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected in addition as new or enhanced products are introduced we must successfully manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption in customers’ ordering patterns avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that we can deliver sufficient supplies of new products to meet customers’ demands

our growth strategy includes acquisitions and we may not be able to execute on our acquisition strategy or integrate acquisitions successfully

our recent historical growth has depended and our future growth is likely to continue to depend in part on our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses into our existing operations we intend to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world we cannot assure we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition opportunities prevail against competing potential acquirers negotiate appropriate acquisition terms obtain financing that may be needed to consummate such acquisitions complete proposed acquisitions successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new markets in addition we cannot assure that any acquisition once successfully integrated will perform as planned be accretive to earnings or prove to be beneficial to our operations and cash flow

the success of our acquisition strategy is subject to other risks and uncertainties including















in addition an acquisition could adversely impact our operating performance as a result of the incurrence of acquisitionrelated debt preacquisition potential tax liabilities acquisition expenses the amortization of acquisitionacquired assets or possible future impairments of goodwill or intangible assets associated with the acquisition

we may also face liability with respect to acquired businesses for violations of environmental laws occurring prior to the date of our acquisition and some or all of these liabilities may not be covered by environmental insurance secured to mitigate the risk or by indemnification from the sellers from which we acquired these businesses we could also incur significant costs including but not limited to remediation costs natural resources damages civil or criminal fines and sanctions and thirdparty claims as a result of past or future violations of or liabilities associated with environmental laws

increased it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems networks products solutions and services 

increased global it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including employee training comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems our systems networks products solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats depending on their nature and scope such threats could potentially lead to the compromising of confidential information improper use of our systems and networks manipulation and destruction of data defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions which in turn could adversely affect our reputation competitiveness and results of operations

if our intellectual property protection is inadequate others may be able to use our technologies and tradenames and thereby reduce our ability to compete which could have a material adverse effect on us our financial condition and results of operations

we regard much of the technology underlying our products and the trademarks under which we market our products as proprietary the steps we take to protect our proprietary technology may be inadequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or third parties may independently develop similar technology we rely on a combination of patents trademark copyright and trade secret laws employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and other contracts to establish and protect our technology and other intellectual property rights the agreements may be breached or terminated and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach and existing trade secrets patent and copyright law afford us limited protection policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult a third party could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization litigation may be necessary for us to defend against claims of infringement or to protect our intellectual property rights and could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our efforts further we might not prevail in such litigation which could harm our business

our products could infringe on the intellectual property of others which may cause us to engage in costly litigation and if we are not successful could cause us to pay substantial damages and prohibit us from selling our products

third parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us based on their patents or other intellectual property claims and we may have to pay substantial damages possibly including treble damages if it is ultimately determined our products infringe we may have to obtain a license to sell our products if it is determined that our products infringe upon another party’s intellectual property we might be prohibited from selling our products before we obtain a license which if available at all may require us to pay substantial royalties even if infringement claims against us are without merit defending these types of lawsuits takes significant time may be expensive and may divert management attention from other business concerns

any impairment in the value of our intangible assets including goodwill would negatively affect our operating results and total capitalization

our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets primarily goodwill the goodwill results from our acquisitions and represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the identifiable net assets we acquired we assess at least annually whether there has been any impairment in the value of our intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels if competing or alternative technologies emerge if market conditions for acquired businesses decline if significant and prolonged negative industry or economic trends exist if our stock price and market capitalization declines or if future cash flow estimates decline we could incur under current applicable accounting rules a noncash charge to operating earnings for goodwill impairment any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and equity book value the effect of which could be material

nordson corporation 11 

 

we may be exposed to liabilities under the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are subject to compliance with various laws and regulations including the fcpa and similar worldwide antibribery laws which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or making other improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining an unfair business advantage the fcpa also requires proper record keeping and characterization of such payments in our reports filed with the sec our employees are trained and required to comply with these laws and we are committed to legal compliance and corporate ethics violations of these laws could result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and financial penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition or results of operations 

inability to access capital could impede growth or the repayment or refinancing of existing indebtedness

the limits imposed on us by the restrictive covenants contained in our credit facilities could prevent us from making acquisitions or cause us to lose access to these facilities

our existing credit facilities contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to among other things









in addition our credit facilities require us to meet financial ratios including a “leverage ratio” and an “interest coverage ratio” both as defined in the credit facilities

these restrictions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs and could otherwise restrict our financing activities

our ability to comply with the covenants and other terms of our credit facilities will depend on our future operating performance if we fail to comply with such covenants and terms we may be in default and the maturity of the related debt could be accelerated and become immediately due and payable we may be required to obtain waivers from our lenders in order to maintain compliance under our credit facilities including waivers with respect to our compliance with certain financial covenants if we are unable to obtain necessary waivers and the debt under our credit facilities is accelerated we would be required to obtain replacement financing at prevailing market rates

we may need new or additional financing in the future to expand our business or refinance existing indebtedness if we are unable to access capital on satisfactory terms and conditions we may not be able to expand our business or meet our payment requirements under our existing credit facilities our ability to obtain new or additional financing will depend on a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control we may not be able to obtain new or additional financing because we have substantial debt or because we may not have sufficient cash flow to service or repay our existing or future debt in addition depending on market conditions and our financial performance neither debt nor equity financing may be available on satisfactory terms or at all finally as a consequence of worsening financial market conditions our credit facility providers may not provide the agreed credit if they become undercapitalized

changes in interest rates could adversely affect us

any period of interest rate increases may also adversely affect our profitability at october 31 2015 we had 1116593 of total debt and notes payable outstanding of which 67 percent was priced at interest rates that float with the market a one percent increase in the interest rate on the floating rate debt in 2015 would have resulted in approximately 7456 of additional interest expense a higher level of floating rate debt would increase the exposure to changes in interest rates for additional detail related to this risk see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk

nordson corporation 12 

 

failure to retain our existing senior mana gement team or the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could hurt our business and inhibit our ability to operate and grow successfully 

our success will continue to depend to a significant extent on the continued service of our executive management team and the ability to recruit hire and retain other key management personnel to support our growth and operational initiatives and replace executives who retire or resign failure to retain our leadership team and attract and retain other important management and technical personnel could place a constraint on our global growth and operational initiatives possibly resulting in inefficient and ineffective management and operations which would likely harm our revenues operations and product development efforts and eventually result in a decrease in profitability

the level of returns on pension plan assets and changes in the actuarial assumptions used could adversely affect us

our operating results may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of expense we record for our defined benefit pension plans us gaap requires that we calculate pension expense using actuarial valuations which are dependent upon our various assumptions including estimates of expected longterm rate of return on plan assets discount rates for future payment obligations and the expected rate of increase in future compensation levels our pension expense and funding requirements may also be affected by our actual return on plan assets and by legislation and other government regulatory actions changes in assumptions laws or regulations could lead to variability in operating results and could have a material adverse impact on liquidity

new regulations related to conflictfree minerals may result in additional expenses that could affect our financial condition and business operations

pursuant to the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the sec promulgated final rules regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals known as conflict minerals which are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries as well as procedures regarding a manufacturer’s efforts to prevent the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from those minerals these new disclosure obligations will require continuing due diligence efforts to support our future disclosure requirements we incurred and will continue to incur costs associated with complying with such disclosure requirements including costs associated with canvassing our supply chain to determine the source country of any conflict minerals incorporated in our products in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities in addition the implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products

political conditions in foreign countries in which we operate could adversely affect us

we conduct our manufacturing sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and are subject to risks associated with doing business outside the united states in 2015 approximately 69 percent of our total sales were generated outside the united states we expect that international operations and united states export sales will continue to be important to our business for the foreseeable future both sales from international operations and export sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside the united states such risks include but are not limited to the following





















nordson corporation 13 

 

any of these events could reduce the demand for our products limit the prices at which we can sell our products interrupt our supply chain or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operating performance 

our international operations also depend upon favorable trade relations between the us and those foreign countries in which our customers subcontractors and materials suppliers have operations a protectionist trade environment in either the us or those foreign countries in which we do business such as a change in the current tariff structures export compliance or other trade policies may materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our products in foreign markets

our business and operating results may be adversely affected by natural disasters or other catastrophic events beyond our control

while we have taken precautions to prevent production and service interruptions at our global facilities severe weather conditions such as hurricanes or tornadoes as well major earthquakes and other natural disasters in areas in which we have manufacturing facilities or from which we obtain products may cause physical damage to our properties closure of one or more of our manufacturing or distribution facilities lack of an adequate work force in a market temporary disruption in the supply of inventory disruption in the transport of products and utilities and delays in the delivery of products to our customers any of these factors may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

the insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures

we maintain property business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered we are potentially at risk if one or more of our insurance carriers fail additionally severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the ratings and survival of some insurers in the future we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain

 item 3 legal proceedings

we are involved in pending or potential litigation regarding environmental product liability patent contract employee and other matters arising from the normal course of business including the environmental matter discussed below it is our opinion after consultation with legal counsel that resolutions of these matters are not expected to result in a material effect on our financial condition quarterly or annual operating results or cash flows

environmental – we have voluntarily agreed with the city of new richmond wisconsin and other potentially responsible parties to share costs associated with the remediation of the city of new richmond municipal landfill the “site” and constructing a potable water delivery system serving the impacted area down gradient of the site at october 31 2015 and 2014 our accrual for the ongoing operation maintenance and monitoring obligation at the site was 565 and 615 respectively 

the liability for environmental remediation represents management’s best estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable undiscounted costs related to known remediation obligations the accuracy of our estimate of environmental liability is affected by several uncertainties such as additional requirements that may be identified in connection with remedial activities the complexity and evolution of environmental laws and regulations and the identification of presently unknown remediation requirements consequently our liability could be different than our current estimate however we do not expect that the costs associated with remediation will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

critical accounting policies and estimates

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses on an ongoing basis we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that are used to prepare financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates used by management

certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below on a regular basis critical accounting policies are reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors

revenue recognition – most of our revenues are recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the sales price is fixed or determinable collectibility is reasonably assured and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer the fasb has issued guidance on multiple deliverable arrangements that establishes a relative selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available thirdparty evidence tpe if vendorspecific objective evidence is not available or best estimated selling price besp if neither vendorspecific objective evidence nor thirdparty evidence is available our multiple deliverable arrangements include installation installation supervision training and spare parts which tend to be completed in a short period of time at an insignificant cost and utilizing skills not unique to us and therefore are typically regarded as inconsequential or perfunctory revenue for undelivered items is deferred and included within accrued liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet revenues deferred in 2015 2014 and 2013 were not material 

translation of foreign currency financial statements and foreign currency transactions – our reporting currency is the us dollar however the functional currency for each of our foreign subsidiaries is its principal operating currency we translate the amounts included in our consolidated statements of income from our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars at weightedaverage exchange rates which we believe are representative of the actual exchange rates on the dates of the transactions our foreign subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars from local currency at the actual exchange rates as of the end of each reporting date and we record the resulting foreign exchange translation adjustments in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss if the us dollar strengthens we reflect the resulting losses as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss conversely if the us dollar weakens foreign exchange translation gains result which favorably impact accumulated other comprehensive income loss translation adjustments may be included in net earnings in the event of a sale or liquidation of certain of our underlying foreign investments if we determine that the functional currency of any of our foreign subsidiaries should be the us dollar our financial statements will be affected should this occur we will adjust our reporting to appropriately account for any such changes 

as appropriate we use permanently invested intercompany loans as a source of capital to reduce exposure to foreign currency fluctuations at our foreign subsidiaries these loans on a consolidated basis are treated as being analogous to equity for accounting purposes therefore foreign exchange gains or losses on these intercompany loans are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss

goodwill – goodwill is the excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in various business combinations goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level or more often if indications of impairment exist our reporting units are the adhesive dispensing systems segment the industrial coating systems segment and one level below the advanced technology systems segment 

nordson corporation 22 

 

we test goodwill in accordance with accounting standards codification asc 350 the goodwill impairment test is a twostep process in the first step performed in the fourth quarter of each year we estimate a reporting unit’s fair value using a combination of the discounted cash flow method of the income approach and the guideline publi c company method of the market approach and compare the result against the reporting unit’s carrying value of net assets if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value then a second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired  we use an independent valuation specialist to assist with refining our assumptions and methods used to determine fair values using these methods in step one the discounted cash flow method uses assumptions for revenue growth operating margin and work ing capital turnover that are based on general management’s strategic plans tempered by performance trends and reasonable expectations about those trends terminal value calculations employ a published formula known as the gordon growth model method that e ssentially captures the present value of perpetual cash flows beyond the last projected period assuming a constant weighted average cost of capital wacc methodology and growth rate for each reporting unit a sensitivity analysis is performed to vary the discount and terminal growth rates in order to provide a range of reasonableness for detecting impairment 

discount rates are developed using a wacc methodology the wacc represents the blended average required rate of return for equity and debt capital based on observed market return data and company specific risk factors for 2015 the discount rates used ranged from 10 percent to 16 percent depending upon the reporting units size end market volatility and projection risk the calculated internal rate of return for the discounted cash flow method was 11 percent the same as the calculated wacc for total nordson in the application of the guideline public company method fair value is determined using transactional evidence for similar publicly traded equity the comparable company guideline group is determined based on relative similarities to each reporting unit since exact correlations are not available an indication of fair value for each reporting unit is based on the placement of each reporting unit within a range of multiples determined for its comparable guideline company group valuation multiples are derived by dividing latest twelve month performance for revenues and ebitda into total invested capital which is the sum of traded equity plus interest bearing debt less cash these multiples are applied against the revenue and ebitda of each reporting unit while the implied indications of fair value using the guideline public company method yield meaningful results the discounted cash flow method of the income approach includes management’s thoughtful projections and insights as to what the reporting units will accomplish in the near future accordingly the reasonable implied fair value of each reporting unit is a blend based on the relative strength of the approaches employed

to test the reasonableness of the aggregate fair value we performed the control premium test which compares the sum of the implied fair values calculated for our reporting units net of debt to the market value of equity the control premium was 3 percent as of the test date of august 1 2015 and 13 percent as of october 31 2015 the control premium indicated that the discounted cash flow valuation was reasonable 

in 2015 and 2014 the results of our step one testing indicated no impairment therefore the second step of impairment testing was not necessary

nordson corporation 23 

 

the excess of fair value fv over carrying value cv was compared to the carrying value for each reporting unit based on the results shown in the table below a nd based on our measurement date of august 1 201 5  our conclusion is that no indicators of impairment exist in 201 5  potential events or circumstances such as a sustained downturn in global economies could have a negative effect on estimated fair values  

 



 

the table above does not include two acquisitions that occurred after the august 1 measurement date but before our fiscal yearend we acquired wafo produktionsgesellschaft gmbh “wafo” on august 3 2015 and matrix technologies gmbh “matrix” on september 1 2015 determination of the preliminary goodwill associated with these acquisitions was completed with the assistance of an independent valuation specialist in the fourth quarter of 2015 since the dates of the valuations no events or changes in circumstances have occurred that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of these acquisitions below their carrying values for future valuation purposes wafo will be included in the adhesive dispensing systems segment reporting unit and matrix will be included in the advanced technology systems – test  inspection reporting unit

other longlived assets – we test other depreciable and amortizable longlived assets for recoverability in accordance with asc 360 using undiscounted cash flows if indicators of impairment exist the total carrying value of longlived assets for each reporting unit is compared to the forecasted cash flows of each reporting unit’s longlived assets being tested cash flows have been defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization less annual maintenance capital spending 

inventories  inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market cost was determined using the lastin firstout lifo method for 20 percent of consolidated inventories at october 31 2015 and october 31 2014 with the firstin firstout fifo method used for the remaining inventory on an ongoing basis inventory is tested for technical obsolescence as well as for future demand and changes in market conditions we have historically maintained inventory reserves to reflect those conditions when the cost of inventory is not expected to be recovered reserves are also maintained for inventory used for demonstration purposes the inventory reserve balance was 28230 26744 and 26579 at october 31 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively 

pension plans and postretirement medical plans  the measurement of liabilities related to our pension plans and postretirement medical plans is based on management’s assumptions related to future factors including interest rates return on pension plan assets compensation increases mortality and turnover assumptions and health care cost trend rates 

the weightedaverage discount rate used to determine the present value of our domestic pension plan obligations was 439 percent at october 31 2015 and 429 percent at october 31 2014 the weightedaverage discount rate used to determine the present value of our various international pension plan obligations was 281 percent at october 31 2015 compared to 294 percent at october 31 2014 the discount rates used for all plans were determined by using quality fixed income investments with a duration period approximately equal to the period over which pension obligations are expected to be settled

in determining the expected return on plan assets we consider both historical performance and an estimate of future longterm rates of return on assets similar to those in our plans we consult with and consider the opinions of financial and actuarial experts in developing appropriate return assumptions the expected rate of return longterm investment rate on domestic pension assets used to determine net benefit costs was 676 percent in 2015 and 724 percent in 2014 the average expected rate of return on international pension assets used to determine net benefit costs was 439 percent in 2015 and 460 percent in 2014

nordson corporation 24 

 

the assumed rate of compensation increases used to determine the present value of our domestic pension plan obligations was 350 percent at october 31 201 5 compared to 349 percent at october 31 2014 the assumed rate of compensation increases used to determine the present value of our international pension plan obligations was 322 percent at october 31 2015 compared to 319 percent at october 31 2014  

annual expense amounts are determined based on the discount rate used at the end of the prior year differences between actual and assumed investment returns on pension plan assets result in actuarial gains or losses that are amortized into expense over a period of years

with respect to the domestic postretirement medical plan the discount rate used to value the benefit plan was 450 percent at october 31 2015 and 440 percent at october 31 2014 the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the health care cost trend rate is assumed to be 372 percent in 2016 decreasing gradually to 327 percent in 2025

for the international postretirement plan the discount rate used to value the benefit obligation was 435 percent at october 31 2015 and 425 percent at october 31 2014 the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the health care cost trend rate is assumed to be 631 percent in 2016 decreasing gradually to 350 percent in 2031

employees hired after january 1 2002 are not eligible to participate in the domestic postretirement medical plan

pension and postretirement expenses in 2016 are expected to be approximately 4900 lower than 2015 primarily due to changes in discount rates 

income taxes – income taxes are estimated based on income for financial reporting purposes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes and certain changes in valuation allowances we provide valuation allowances against deferred tax assets if based on available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

management believes the valuation allowances are adequate after considering future taxable income allowable carryforward periods and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize the deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount including the valuation allowance an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made conversely should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be expensed in the period such determination was made

further at each interim reporting period we estimate an effective income tax rate that is expected to be applicable for the full year significant judgment is involved regarding the application of global income tax laws and regulations and when projecting the jurisdictional mix of income additionally interpretation of tax laws court decisions or other guidance provided by taxing authorities influences our estimate of the effective income tax rates as a result our actual effective income tax rates and related income tax liabilities may differ materially from our estimated effective tax rates and related income tax liabilities any resulting differences are recorded in the period they become known

financial instruments  assets liabilities and commitments that are to be settled in cash and are denominated in foreign currencies are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates we enter into foreign currency forward contracts which are derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of foreign currency exposures resulting from the collection of receivables payables and loans denominated in foreign currencies the maturities of these contracts are usually less than 90 days forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and therefore are marked to market each accounting period and the resulting gains or losses are included in “other–net” within other income expense in the consolidated statement of income 

warranties  we provide customers with a product warranty that requires us to repair or replace defective products within a specified period of time generally one year from the date of delivery or first use an accrual is recorded for expected warranty costs for products shipped through the end of each accounting period in determining the amount of the accrual we rely primarily on historical warranty claims amounts charged to the warranty reserve were 12531 10813 and 7891 in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively the reserve balance was 10537 9918 and 9409 at october 31 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively

recently issued accounting standards  in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a new standard regarding revenue recognition under this standard a company recognizes revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the standard implements a fivestep process for customer contract revenue recognition that focuses on transfer of control in august 2015  the fasb issued a standard to delay the effective date by one year in accordance with this delay the new standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2019 early adoption is permitted but not before the original effective date of the standard the new standard is required to be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying it recognized at the date of initial application we are currently assessing the impact this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements as well as the method by which we will adopt the new standard 

in april 2015 the fasb issued a new standard regarding the presentation of debt issuance costs under this standard a company is required to present unamortized debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability rather than as a separate asset the recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by this new standard in august 2015 the fasb issued an amendment to this standard to address lineofcredit arrangements which would allow an entity to present debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortize the debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the lineofcredit arrangement it will be effective for us beginning in 2017 we do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as it will only impact presentation

in july 2015 the fasb issued a new standard regarding the measurement of inventory under this standard inventory that is measured using the firstin firstout “fifo” or average cost methods is required to be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion disposal and transportation this standard does not impact inventory measured on a lastin lastout “lifo” method it will be effective for us beginning in 2017 we are currently assessing the impact this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements 

in september 2015 the fasb issued a new standard intended to simplify the accounting for measurement period adjustments in a business combination measurement period adjustments are changes to provisional amounts recorded when the accounting for a business combination is incomplete as of the end of a reporting period the measurement period can extend for up to a year following the transaction date during the measurement period companies may make adjustments to provisional amounts when information necessary to complete the measurement is received the new guidance requires companies to recognize these adjustments including any related impacts to net income in the reporting period in which the adjustments are determined companies are no longer required to retroactively apply measurement period adjustments to all periods presented it will be effective for us beginning in 2017 the new guidance will be applied prospectively and the impact of adoption will be dependent on the nature of measurement period adjustments that may be necessary

liquidity and capital resources 

cash and cash equivalents increased 7954 in 2015 cash provided by operating activities was 261951 in 2015 compared to 288330 in 2014 the primary sources were net income adjusted for noncash income and expenses consisting of depreciation and amortization noncash stock compensation deferred income taxes other noncash expense and loss on sale of property plant and equipment and the tax benefit from the exercise of stock options the sum of which was 291452 in 2015 compared to 322529 in 2014 operating assets and liabilities used 29501 of cash in 2015 compared to 34199 in 2014 the primary reasons for this decrease were higher receivables due to higher yearend shipments higher inventory investments to meet anticipated demand partially offset by higher income taxes payable and other accrued liabilities 

cash used by investing activities was 138535 in 2015 down from 230525 in 2014 in the current year cash of 75565 was used for the liquidyn wafo and matrix acquisitions compared to the 2014 acquisitions of avalon laboratories and dima group bv which used 186420 of cash capital expenditures were 62087 in 2015 up from 43574 in the prior year current year capital expenditures included a new facility in colorado supporting our fluid management product lines production machinery and continued investments in our information systems platform

the following is a summary of significant changes by balance sheet caption from october 31 2014 to october 31 2015 receivables increased 23706 primarily due to higher yearend shipments combined with receivable balances held by liquidyn wafo and matrix which were all acquired in 2015 the increase of 14801 in inventories was primarily due to acquisitions and higher inventory investments to meet anticipated demand net property plant and equipment increased 25501 primarily due to capital expenditures and acquisitions partially offset by depreciation expense goodwill increased 29838 due to acquisitions completed in 2015 that added 46389 of goodwill offset by 16551 from the effects of currency translation the decrease in net other intangibles of 13884 was due to 22081 of intangibles added as a result of the 2015 acquisitions offset by 27487 of amortization and 8478 from the effects of currency translation

the decrease in notes payable of 105073 was primarily due to the repayment of a 100000 shortterm credit facility with pnc bank the increase in income taxes payable of 12056 was due to the timing of required tax payments the increase of 3930 in accrued liabilities was primarily due to higher compensationrelated accruals current maturities of longterm debt increased 12091 as a result of the scheduled repayment of our new york life credit facility the longterm debt increase of 409775 primarily reflects 81783 of net borrowings under our revolving credit agreement 14445 of net borrowings under our new york life credit facility 200000 of borrowings under our new term loan facility 100000 of borrowings from new senior notes and 77042 of borrowings under a new euro term loan entered into with bank of america these borrowings were offset by repayments of 51743 under our €100000 agreement with the bank of tokyomitsubishi ufj ltd and the reclassification from longterm to current maturities as mentioned above the 6011 decrease in longterm pension obligations and the 1610 decrease in postretirement obligations were primarily the result of a higher valuation of plan assets a slight increase in the global weightedaverage discount rate partially offset by compensation increases 

in december 2014 the board of directors authorized a new 300000 common share repurchase program this program replaced the 200000 program approved by the board in august 2013 uses for repurchased shares include the funding of benefit programs including stock options restricted stock and 401k matching shares purchased are treated as treasury shares until used for such purposes the repurchase program is being funded using cash from operations and proceeds from borrowings under our credit facilities

as of october 31 2015 approximately 88 percent of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents were held at various foreign subsidiaries deferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries that are intended to be permanently invested in those operations these undistributed earnings represent the postincome tax earnings under us gaap not adjusted for previously taxed income which aggregated approximately 712913 and 622914 at october 31 2015 and 2014 respectively should these earnings be distributed applicable foreign tax credits distributions of previously taxed income and utilization of other attributes would substantially offset taxes due upon the distribution it is not practical to estimate the amount of additional taxes that might be payable on such undistributed earnings

outlook 

our operating performance balance sheet position and financial ratios for 2015 remained strong relative to recent years although uncertainties persisted in global financial markets and the general economic environment going forward we are wellpositioned to manage our liquidity needs that arise from working capital requirements capital expenditures contributions related to pension and postretirement obligations and principal and interest payments on indebtedness primary sources of capital to meet these needs as well as other opportunistic investments are cash provided by operations and borrowings under our loan agreements in 2015 cash from operations was 155 percent of revenue with respect to borrowing under existing loan agreements as of october 31 2015 we had 142975 available capacity under our fiveyear term 600000 unsecured multicurrency credit facility which may be increased to 850000 under certain conditions this credit facility expires in february 2020 in addition we had 107222 borrowing capacity remaining on our 175000 threeyear private shelf agreement with new york life investment management llc while these facilities provide the contractual terms for any borrowing we cannot be assured that these facilities would be available in the event that these financial institutions failed to remain sufficiently capitalized

other loan agreements exist with no remaining borrowing capacity but factor into debt covenant calculations that affect future borrowing capacity on july 26 2012 we entered into a note purchase agreement with a group of insurance companies under which we sold 200000 of senior notes the notes mature between july 2017 and july 2025 and bear interest at fixed rates between 227 percent and 313 percent as of october 31 2015 we owe €10450 on a €100000 threeyear term loan facility entered into on august 30 2013 with the bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj ltd this loan facility bears interest at variable margin rates of 075 percent to 1625 percent above eur libor as of april 10 2015 we entered into a 200000 term loan facility with a group of banks 100000 is due in three years and has an interest rate spread of 1 percent over libor and 100000 is due in five years and has an interest rate spread of 11 over libor on july 28 2015 we entered into a note purchase agreement under which 100000 of senior unsecured notes were purchased primarily by a group of insurance companies the notes consist of two tranches series a and b at 50000 each maturing in july 2025 and july 2027 and bearing interest at fixed rates of 289 percent and 319 percent respectively on october 05 2015 we entered into a €70000 three year term loan agreement with bank of america merrill lynch international limited in london the interest rate is variable based on the libor rate plus applicable margin based on our leverage ratio at october 31 2015 the interest rate was 0875 percent over libor

respective to all of these loans are two primary covenants the leverage ratio that restricts indebtedness net of cash to a maximum 350 times consolidated fourquarter trailing ebitda and the interest coverage ratio that requires fourquarter trailing ebitda to be at minimum 30 times consolidated trailing fourquarter interest expense debt ebitda and interest expense are as defined in their respective credit agreements with respect to these two primary covenants as of october 31 2015 we were approximately 75 percent of the most restrictive leverage ratio and approximately 13 percent of the most restrictive interest coverage ratio unused borrowing capacity under existing loan agreements would amount to an additional 17 percent of the most restrictive leverage ratio

regarding expectations for 2016 we are optimistic about longer term growth opportunities in the diverse consumer durable nondurable medical electronics and industrial end markets we serve however we move forward in the nearterm with caution given negative currency translation effects of a much stronger us dollar continued slow growth in emerging markets expectations for global gdp indicating a lowgrowth macroeconomic environment and marketplace effects of political instability in certain areas of the world though the pace of improvement in the global economy remains unclear our growth potential has been demonstrated over time from our capacity to build and enhance our core businesses by entering emerging markets and pursuing market adjacencies we drive value for our customers through our application expertise differentiated technology and direct sales and service support our priorities also are focused on operational efficiencies by employing continuous improvement methodologies in our business processes we expect our efforts will continue to provide more than sufficient cash from operations for meeting our liquidity needs and paying dividends to common shareholders as well as enabling us to invest in the development of new applications and markets for our technologies cash from operations have been 15 to 20 percent of revenues over the past five years resulting in more than sufficient cash for our ordinary business requirements we believe our cash provided from operations and available borrowing capacity will enable us to make other opportunistic investments in our own common shares and strategic business combinations 

nordson corporation 34 

 

with respect to contractual spending the table above presents our financial obligations as 1320802 of which 124340 is payable in 2016 in august 2015  the board of directors approved a 200000 common share repurchase program that added capacity to the board’s december 2014 approval authorizing management at its discretion to repurchase shares up to 300000 under the expanded 500000 share repurchase program a balance of 150 8 48 remained as of october 31  2015  this new authorization continues a succession of share repurchase programs authorized since 2011 the repurchase program is funded using cash from operations and proceeds from borrowings under our credit facilities timing and actu al number of shares subject to repurchase are contingent on a number of factors including levels of cash generation from operations cash requirements for acquisitions repayment of debt and our share price capital expenditures for 2016 will be focused o n continued investments in our information systems and projects that improve both capacity and efficiency of manufacturing and distribution operations 

effects of foreign currency

the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on sales and operating results cannot be precisely measured due to fluctuating selling prices sales volume product mix and cost structures in each country where we operate as a general rule a weakening of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies has a favorable effect on sales and net income while a strengthening of the dollar has a detrimental effect

in 2015 as compared with 2014 the united states dollar was stronger against foreign currencies if 2014 exchange rates had been in effect during 2015 sales would have been approximately 114844 higher and thirdparty costs would have been approximately 67414 higher in 2014 as compared with 2013 the united states dollar was generally stronger against foreign currencies if 2013 exchange rates had been in effect during 2014 sales would have been approximately 7002 higher and thirdparty costs would have been approximately 1845 higher these effects on reported sales do not include the impact of local price adjustments made in response to changes in currency exchange rates

inflation

inflation affects profit margins as the ability to pass cost increases on to customers is restricted by the need for competitive pricing although inflation has been modest in recent years and has had no material effect on the years covered by these financial statements we continue to seek ways to minimize the impact of inflation through focused efforts to increase productivity

trends

the fiveyear summary in item 6 documents our historical financial trends over this period the world’s economic conditions fluctuated significantly our solid performance is attributed to our participation in diverse geographic and industrial markets and our longterm commitment to develop and provide quality products and worldwide service to meet our customers’ changing needs

 item 7a quantitative and qualitat ive disclosures about market risk 

we operate internationally and enter into intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies consequently we are subject to market risk arising from exchange rate movements between the dates foreign currencies are recorded and the dates they are settled we regularly use foreign exchange contracts to reduce our risks related to most of these transactions these contracts primarily associated with the euro yen and pound sterling typically have maturities of 90 days or less and generally require the exchange of foreign currencies for united states dollars at rates stated in the contracts gains and losses from changes in the market value of these contracts offset foreign exchange losses and gains respectively on the underlying transactions other transactions denominated in foreign currencies are designated as hedges of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries or are intercompany transactions of a longterm investment nature as a result of the use of foreign exchange contracts on a routine basis to reduce the risks related to most of our transactions denominated in foreign currencies as of october 31 2015 we did not have material foreign currency exposure

note 13 to the financial statements contains additional information about our foreign currency transactions and the methods and assumptions used to record these transactions

a portion of our operations is financed with shortterm and longterm borrowings and is subject to market risk arising from changes in interest rates

the tables that follow present principal repayments and weightedaverage interest rates on outstanding borrowings of fixedrate debt

 



 

we also have variablerate notes payable and longterm debt the weighted average interest rate of this debt was 12 percent at october 31 2015 and 11 percent at october 31 2014 a one percent increase in interest rates would have resulted in additional interest expense of approximately 6273 on the variable rate notes payable and longterm debt in 2015

manufacturing and raw materials 

our production operations include machining molding and assembly we manufacture specially designed parts and assemble components into finished equipment many components are made in standard modules that can be used in more than one product or in combination with other components for a variety of models we have principal manufacturing operations and sources of supply in the united states in ohio georgia california colorado michigan minnesota new jersey north carolina pennsylvania rhode island virginia and wisconsin as well as in belgium the people’s republic of china germany india mexico the netherlands thailand and the united kingdom

senior operating executives supervise an extensive quality control program for our equipment machinery and systems 

natural gas and other fuels are our primary energy sources however standby capacity for alternative sources is available if needed 

intellectual property 

we maintain procedures to protect our intellectual property including patents trademarks and copyrights both domestically and internationally risk factors associated with our intellectual property are discussed in item 1a risk factors 

our intellectual property portfolios include valuable patents trade secrets knowhow domain names trademarks and trade names as of october 31 2014 we held 534 united states patents and 1181 foreign patents and had 241 united states patent applications pending and 990 foreign patent applications pending but there is no assurance that any patent application will be issued we continue to apply for and obtain patent protection for new products on an ongoing basis 

patents covering individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of filing or grant and legal term of patents in various countries where a patent is obtained our current patent portfolio has expiration dates ranging from november 2014 to july 2039 the actual protection a patent provides which can vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in each country we believe however that the duration of our patents generally exceeds the life cycles of the technologies disclosed and claimed in the patents 

we believe our trademarks are important assets and we aggressively manage our brands we also own a number of trademarks in the united states and foreign countries including registered trademarks for nordson asymtek dage efd micromedics value plastics and xaloy and various common law trademarks which are important to our business inasmuch as they identify nordson and our products to our customers as of october 31 2014 we had a total of 1633 trademark registrations in the united states and in various foreign countries 

we rely upon a combination of nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights and also enter into confidentiality and intellectual property agreements with our employees that require them to disclose any inventions created during employment convey all rights to inventions to us and restrict the distribution of proprietary information 

we protect and promote our intellectual property portfolio and take those actions we deem appropriate to enforce our intellectual property rights and to defend our right to sell our products although in aggregate our intellectual property is important to our operations we do not believe that the loss of any one patent trademark or group of related patents or trademarks would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position of our overall business 

  

seasonal variation in business 

generally the highest volume of sales occurs in our fourth quarter due in large part to the timing of customers’ capital spending programs accordingly first quarter sales volume is typically the lowest of the year due to timing of customers’ capital spending programs and customer holiday shutdowns 

working capital practices 

no special or unusual practices affect our working capital we generally require advance payments as deposits on customized equipment and systems and in certain cases require progress payments during the manufacturing of these products we continue to initiate new processes focused on reduction of manufacturing lead times resulting in lower investment in inventory while maintaining the capability to respond promptly to customer needs 

custo mers 

we serve a broad customer base both in terms of industries and geographic regions in 2014 no single customer accounted for ten percent or more of sales 

back log 

our backlog of open orders increased to approximately 223000 at october 31 2014 from approximately 211000 at october 31 2013 the amounts for both years were calculated based upon exchange rates in effect at october 31 2014 the increase is primarily due to orders within the advanced technology segment as well as from 2014 acquisitions all orders in the 2014 yearend backlog are expected to be shipped to customers in 2015 

gov ernment contracts 

our business neither includes nor depends upon a significant amount of governmental contracts or subcontracts therefore no material part of our business is subject to renegotiation or termination at the option of the government

our equipment is sold in competition with a wide variety of alternative bonding sealing finishing coating processing testing inspecting and fluid control techniques  potential uses for our equipment include any production processes that require preparation modification or curing of surfaces dispensing application processing or control of fluids and materials or testing and inspecting for quality 

many factors influence our competitive position including pricing product quality and service we maintain a leadership position in our business segments by delivering highquality innovative products and technologies as well as service and technical support working with customers to understand their processes and developing the application solutions that help them meet their production requirements also contributes to our leadership position our worldwide network of direct sales and technical resources also is a competitive advantage 

rese arch and development 

investments in research and development are important to our longterm growth enabling us to keep pace with changing customer and marketplace needs through the development of new products and new applications for existing products we place strong emphasis on technology developments and improvements through internal engineering and research teams research and development expenses were approximately 47536 in 2014 compared with approximately 47973 in 2013 and 36535 in 2012 as a percentage of sales research and development expenses were approximately 28 31 and 26 percent in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

environmental compliance 

we are subject to extensive federal state local and foreign environmental safety and health laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to land and water and the generation handling treatment and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials under certain of these laws we can be held strictly liable for hazardous substance contamination of any real property we have ever owned operated or used as a disposal site or for natural resource damages associated with such contamination we are also required to maintain various related permits and licenses many of which require periodic modification and renewal the operation of manufacturing plants unavoidably entails environmental safety and health risks and we could incur material unanticipated costs or liabilities in the future if any of these risks were realized in ways or to an extent that we did not anticipate 

  

we believe that we operate in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations compliance with environmental laws and regulations requires continuing management effort and expenditures we have incurred and will continue to incur costs and capital expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations and to obtain and maintain the necessary permits and licenses we believe that the cost of complying with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our earnings liquidity or competitive position but cannot assure that material compliancerelated costs and expenses may not arise in the future for example future adoption of new or amended environmental laws regulations or requirements or newly discovered contamination or other circumstances that could require us to incur costs and expenses that may have a material effect but cannot be presently anticipated 

we believe that policies practices and procedures have been properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of material environmental damage arising from our operations we accrue for estimated environmental liabilities with charges to expense and believe our environmental accrual is adequate to provide for our portion of the costs of all such known environmental liabilities compliance with federal state and local environmental protection laws during 2014 had no material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position based upon consideration of currently available information we believe liabilities for environmental matters will not have a material adverse affect on our financial position operating results or liquidity but we cannot assure that material environmental liabilities may not arise in the future 

employees 

as of october 31 2014 we had 5966 fulltime and parttime employees including 146 at our amherst ohio facility who are represented by a collective bargaining agreement that expires on october 30 2016 and 64 at our new castle pennsylvania facility who are represented by collective bargaining agreements that expire on august 31 2017 and september 30 2017 no work stoppages have been experienced at any of our facilities during any of the periods covered by this report

 item 1a risk factors tableend in an enterprise as diverse as ours a wide range of factors could affect future performance we discuss in this section some of the risk factors that if they actually occurred could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition value and results of operations you should consider these risk factors in connection with evaluating the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k because these factors could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected in forwardlooking statements 

the significant risk factors affecting our operations include the following 

changes in united states or international economic conditions could adversely affect the profitability of any of our operations 

in 2014 approximately 30 percent of our revenue was derived from domestic customers while approximately 70 percent was derived from international customers our largest markets include appliance automotive construction container electronics assembly food and beverage furniture life sciences and medical metal finishing nonwovens packaging paper and paperboard converting plastics processing and semiconductor a slowdown in any of these specific end markets could directly affect our revenue stream and profitability 

a portion of our product sales is attributable to industries and markets such as the semiconductor mobile electronics and metal finishing industries which historically have been cyclical and sensitive to relative changes in supply and demand and general economic conditions the demand for our products depends in part on the general economic conditions of the industries or national economies of our customers downward economic cycles in our customers’ industries or countries may reduce sales of some of our products it is not possible to predict accurately the factors that will affect demand for our products in the future 

any significant downturn in the health of the general economy globally regionally or in the markets in which we sell products could have an adverse effect on our revenues and financial performance resulting in impairment of assets 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions and we may not be able to execute on our acquisition strategy or integrate acquisitions successfully 

our recent historical growth has depended and our future growth is likely to continue to depend in part on our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses into our existing operations we intend to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world we cannot assure however that we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition opportunities prevail against competing potential acquirers negotiate appropriate acquisition terms obtain financing that may be needed to consummate such acquisitions complete proposed acquisitions successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new markets in addition we cannot assure that any acquisition once successfully integrated will perform as planned be accretive to earnings or prove to be beneficial to our operations and cash flow 

the success of our acquisition strategy is subject to other risks and uncertainties including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

in addition an acquisition could adversely impact our operating performance as a result of the incurrence of acquisitionrelated debt preacquisition potential tax liabilities acquisition expenses the amortization of acquisitionacquired assets or possible future impairments of goodwill or intangible assets associated with the acquisition 

we may also face liability with respect to acquired businesses for violations of environmental laws occurring prior to the date of our acquisition and some or all of these liabilities may not be covered by environmental insurance secured to mitigate the risk or by indemnification from the sellers from which we acquired these businesses we could also incur significant costs including but not limited to remediation costs natural resources damages civil or criminal fines and sanctions and thirdparty claims as a result of past or future violations of or liabilities associated with environmental laws 

if we fail to develop new products or our customers do not accept the new products we develop our revenue and profitability could be adversely impacted 

innovation is critical to our success we believe that we must continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and manufacture new products with improved capabilities in order to continue to be a leading provider of precision technology solutions for the industrial equipment market we also believe that we must continue to make improvements in our productivity in order to maintain our competitive position difficulties or delays in research development or production of new products or failure to gain market acceptance of new products and technologies may reduce future sales and adversely affect our competitive position we continue to invest in the development and marketing of new products there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses if we fail to make innovations launch products with quality problems or the market does not accept our new products our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected in addition as new or enhanced products are introduced we must successfully manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption in customers’ ordering patterns avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that we can deliver sufficient supplies of new products to meet customers’ demands 

increased it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems networks products solutions and services 

increased global it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including employee training comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems our systems networks products solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats depending on their nature and scope such threats could potentially lead to the compromising of confidential information improper use of our systems and networks manipulation and destruction of data defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions which in turn could adversely affect our reputation competitiveness and results of operations 

if our intellectual property protection is inadequate others may be able to use our technologies and tradenames and thereby reduce our ability to compete which could have a material adverse effect on us our financial condition and results of operations 

we regard much of the technology underlying our products and the trademarks under which we market our products as proprietary the steps we take to protect our proprietary technology may be inadequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or third parties may independently develop similar technology we rely on a combination of patents trademark copyright and trade secret laws employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and other contracts to establish and protect our technology and other intellectual property rights the agreements may be breached or terminated and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach and existing trade secrets patent and copyright law afford us limited protection policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult a third party could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization litigation may be necessary for us to defend against claims of infringement or to protect our intellectual property rights and could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our efforts further we might not prevail in such litigation which could harm our business 

  

our products could infringe on the intellectual property of others which may cause us to engage in costly litigation and if we are not successful could cause us to pay substantial damages and prohibit us from selling our products 

third parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us based on their patents or other intellectual property claims and we may have to pay substantial damages possibly including treble damages if it is ultimately determined that our products infringe we may have to obtain a license to sell our products if it is determined that our products infringe upon another party’s intellectual property we might be prohibited from selling our products before we obtain a license which if available at all may require us to pay substantial royalties even if infringement claims against us are without merit defending these types of lawsuits takes significant time may be expensive and may divert management attention from other business concerns 

any impairment in the value of our intangible assets including goodwill would negatively affect our operating results and total capitalization 

our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets primarily goodwill the goodwill results from our acquisitions and represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the identifiable net assets we acquired we assess at least annually whether there has been any impairment in the value of our intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels if competing or alternative technologies emerge if market conditions for acquired businesses decline if significant and prolonged negative industry or economic trends exist if our stock price and market capitalization declines or if future cash flow estimates decline we could incur under current applicable accounting rules a noncash charge to operating earnings for goodwill impairment any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and equity book value the effect of which could be material 

significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates or change in monetary policy may harm our financial results 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly with respect to the euro the yen the pound sterling and the chinese yuan any significant change in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business against the united states dollar could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for additional detail related to this risk see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

the majority of our consolidated revenues in 2014 were generated in currencies other than the united states dollar which is our reporting currency we recognize foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from our operations in the period incurred as a result currency fluctuations between the united states dollar and the currencies in which we do business have caused and will continue to cause foreign currency transaction and translation gains and losses which historically have been material and could continue to be material we cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future operating results because of the number of currencies involved the variability of currency exposures and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates we take actions to manage our foreign currency exposure such as entering into hedging transactions where available but we cannot assure that our strategies will adequately protect our consolidated operating results from the effects of exchange rate fluctuations 

we also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into united states dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or customers located in or conducting business in a country imposing controls currency devaluations diminish the united states dollar value of the currency of the country instituting the devaluation and if they occur or continue for significant periods could adversely affect our earnings or cash flow 

  

we may be exposed to liabilities under the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are subject to compliance with various laws and regulations including the fcpa and similar worldwide antibribery laws which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or making other improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining an unfair business advantage the fcpa also requires proper record keeping and characterization of such payments in our reports filed with the sec our employees are trained and required to comply with these laws and we are committed to legal compliance and corporate ethics violations of these laws could result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and financial penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition or results of operations 

inability to access capital could impede growth or the repayment or refinancing of existing indebtedness 

the limits imposed on us by the restrictive covenants contained in our credit facilities could prevent us from making acquisitions or cause us to lose access to these facilities 

our existing credit facilities contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to among other things 

 

    in addition our credit facilities require us to meet financial ratios including a “leverage ratio” and an “interest coverage ratio” both as defined in the credit facilities 

these restrictions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs and could otherwise restrict our financing activities 

our ability to comply with the covenants and other terms of our credit facilities will depend on our future operating performance if we fail to comply with such covenants and terms we may be in default and the maturity of the related debt could be accelerated and become immediately due and payable we may be required to obtain waivers from our lenders in order to maintain compliance under our credit facilities including waivers with respect to our compliance with certain financial covenants if we are unable to obtain necessary waivers and the debt under our credit facilities is accelerated we would be required to obtain replacement financing at prevailing market rates 

we may need new or additional financing in the future to expand our business or refinance existing indebtedness if we are unable to access capital on satisfactory terms and conditions we may not be able to expand our business or meet our payment requirements under our existing credit facilities our ability to obtain new or additional financing will depend on a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control we may not be able to obtain new or additional financing because we have substantial debt or because we may not have sufficient cash flow to service or repay our existing or future debt in addition depending on market conditions and our financial performance neither debt nor equity financing may be available on satisfactory terms or at all finally as a consequence of worsening financial market conditions our credit facility providers may not provide the agreed credit if they become undercapitalized 

changes in interest rates could adversely affect us 

any period of interest rate increases may also adversely affect our profitability at october 31 2014 we had 799800 of total debt and notes payable outstanding of which 68 percent was priced at interest rates that float with the market a one percent increase in the interest rate on the floating rate debt in 2014 would have resulted in approximately 4201 of additional interest expense a higher level of floating rate debt would increase the exposure to changes in interest rates for additional detail related to this risk see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

  

failure to retain our existing senior management team or the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could hurt our business and inhibit our ability to operate and grow successfully 

our success will continue to depend to a significant extent on the continued service of our executive management team and the ability to recruit hire and retain other key management personnel to support our growth and operational initiatives and replace executives who retire or resign failure to retain our leadership team and attract and retain other important management and technical personnel could place a constraint on our global growth and operational initiatives possibly resulting in inefficient and ineffective management and operations which would likely harm our revenues operations and product development efforts and eventually result in a decrease in profitability 

the level of returns on pension plan assets and changes in the actuarial assumptions used could adversely affect us 

our operating results may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of expense we record for our defined benefit pension plans us gaap requires that we calculate pension expense using actuarial valuations which are dependent upon our various assumptions including estimates of expected longterm rate of return on plan assets discount rates for future payment obligations and the expected rate of increase in future compensation levels our pension expense and funding requirements may also be affected by our actual return on plan assets and by legislation and other government regulatory actions changes in assumptions laws or regulations could lead to variability in operating results and could have a material adverse impact on liquidity 

new regulations related to conflictfree minerals may result in additional expenses that could affect our financial condition and business operations 

pursuant to the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the sec promulgated final rules regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals known as conflict minerals which are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries as well as procedures regarding a manufacturer’s efforts to prevent the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from those minerals these new disclosure obligations will require continuing due diligence efforts to support our future disclosure requirements we incurred and will continue to incur costs associated with complying with such disclosure requirements including costs associated with canvassing our supply chain to determine the source country of any conflict minerals incorporated in our products in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities in addition the implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products 

political conditions in foreign countries in which we operate could adversely affect us 

we conduct our manufacturing sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and are subject to risks associated with doing business outside the united states in 2014 approximately 70 percent of our total sales were to customers outside the united states we expect that international operations and united states export sales will continue to be important to our business for the foreseeable future both sales from international operations and export sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside the united states such risks include but are not limited to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

any of these events could reduce the demand for our products limit the prices at which we can sell our products or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operating performance 

our international operations also depend upon favorable trade relations between the us and those foreign countries in which our customers subcontractors and materials suppliers have operations a protectionist trade environment in either the us or those foreign countries in which we do business such as a change in the current tariff structures export compliance or other trade policies may materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our products in foreign markets 

our business and operating results may be adversely affected by natural disasters or other catastrophic events beyond our control 

while we have taken precautions to prevent production and service interruptions at our global facilities severe weather conditions such as hurricanes or tornadoes as well major earthquakes and other natural disasters in areas in which we have manufacturing facilities or from which we obtain products may cause physical damage to our properties closure of one or more of our manufacturing or distribution facilities lack of an adequate work force in a market temporary disruption in the supply of inventory disruption in the transport of products and utilities and delays in the delivery of products to our customers any of these factors may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

the insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures 

we maintain property business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered we are potentially at risk if one or more of our insurance carriers fail additionally severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the ratings and survival of some insurers in the future we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend we are involved in pending or potential litigation regarding environmental product liability patent contract employee and other matters arising from the normal course of business including the environmental matter discussed below it is our opinion after consultation with legal counsel that resolutions of these matters are not expected to result in a material effect on our financial condition quarterly or annual operating results or cash flows 

environmental — we have voluntarily agreed with the city of new richmond wisconsin and other potentially responsible parties to share costs associated with the remediation of the city of new richmond municipal landfill the “site” and constructing a potable water delivery system serving the impacted area down gradient of the site at october 31 2014 and 2013 our accrual for the ongoing operation maintenance and monitoring obligation at the site was 615 and 668 respectively 

the liability for environmental remediation represents management’s best estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable undiscounted costs related to known remediation obligations the accuracy of our estimate of environmental liability is affected by several uncertainties such as additional requirements that may be identified in connection with remedial activities the complexity and evolution of environmental laws and regulations and the identification of presently unknown remediation requirements consequently our liability could be different than our current estimate however we do not expect that the costs associated with remediation will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses on an ongoing basis we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that are used to prepare financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates used by management 

certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below on a regular basis critical accounting policies are reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 

revenue recognition — most of our revenues are recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the sales price is fixed or determinable collectibility is reasonably assured and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer the fasb has issued guidance on multiple deliverable arrangements that establishes a relative selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available thirdparty evidence tpe if vendorspecific objective evidence is not available or best estimated selling price besp if neither vendorspecific objective evidence nor thirdparty evidence is available our multiple deliverable arrangements include installation installation supervision training and spare parts which tend to be completed in a short period of time at an insignificant cost and utilizing skills not unique to us and therefore are typically regarded as inconsequential or perfunctory revenue for undelivered items is deferred and included within accrued liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet revenues deferred in 2014 2013 and 2012 were not material 

translation of foreign currency financial statements and foreign currency transactions — our reporting currency is the us dollar however the functional currency for each of our foreign subsidiaries is its principal operating currency we translate the amounts included in our consolidated statements of income from our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars at weightedaverage exchange rates which we believe are representative of the actual exchange rates on the dates of the transactions our foreign subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars from local currency at the actual exchange rates as of the end of each reporting date and we record the resulting foreign exchange translation adjustments in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss if the us dollar strengthens we reflect the resulting losses as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss conversely if the us dollar weakens foreign exchange translation gains result which favorably impact accumulated other comprehensive income loss translation adjustments may be included in net earnings in the event of a sale or liquidation of certain of our underlying foreign investments if we determine that the functional currency of any of our foreign subsidiaries should be the us dollar our financial statements will be affected should this occur we will adjust our reporting to appropriately account for any such changes 

as appropriate we use permanently invested intercompany loans as a source of capital to reduce exposure to foreign currency fluctuations at our foreign subsidiaries these loans on a consolidated basis are treated as being analogous to equity for accounting purposes therefore foreign exchange gains or losses on these intercompany loans are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 

  

goodwill — goodwill is the excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in various business combinations goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level or more often if indications of impairment exist our reporting units are the adhesive dispensing systems segment the industrial coating systems segment and one level below the advanced technology systems segment 

we test goodwill in accordance with accounting standards codification asc 350 the goodwill impairment test is a twostep process in the first step performed in the fourth quarter of each year we estimate a reporting unit’s fair value using a combination of the discounted cash flow method of the income approach and the guideline public company method of the market approach and compare the result against the reporting unit’s carrying value of net assets if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value then a second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired we use an independent valuation specialist to assist with refining our assumptions and methods used to determine fair values using these methods in step one the discounted cash flow method uses assumptions for revenue growth operating margin and working capital turnover that are based on general management’s strategic plans tempered by performance trends and reasonable expectations about those trends terminal value calculations employ a published formula known as the gordon growth model method that essentially captures the present value of perpetual cash flows beyond the last projected period assuming a constant weighted average cost of capital wacc methodology and growth rate for each reporting unit a sensitivity analysis is performed to vary the discount and terminal growth rates in order to provide a range of reasonableness for detecting impairment 

discount rates are developed using a wacc methodology the wacc represents the blended average required rate of return for equity and debt capital based on observed market return data and company specific risk factors for 2014 the discount rates used ranged from 10 percent to 17 percent depending upon the reporting unit’s size end market volatility and projection risk the calculated internal rate of return for the discounted cash flow method was 11 percent the same as the calculated wacc for total nordson in the application of the guideline public company method fair value is determined using transactional evidence for similar publicly traded equity the comparable company guideline group is determined based on relative similarities to each reporting unit since exact correlations are not available an indication of fair value for each reporting unit is based on the placement of each reporting unit within a range of multiples determined for its comparable guideline company group valuation multiples are derived by dividing latest twelve month performance for revenues and ebitda into total invested capital which is the sum of traded equity plus interest bearing debt less cash these multiples are applied against the revenue and ebitda of each reporting unit while the implied indications of fair value using the guideline public company method yield meaningful results the discounted cash flow method of the income approach includes management’s thoughtful projections and insights as to what the reporting units will accomplish in the near future accordingly the reasonable implied fair value of each reporting unit is a blend based on the relative strength of the approaches employed 

to test the reasonableness of the aggregate fair value we performed the control premium test which compares the sum of the implied fair values calculated for our reporting units net of debt to the market value of equity the control premium was 7 percent as of the test date of august 1 2014 and 5 percent as of october 31 2014 the control premium indicated that the discounted cash flow valuation was reasonable 

in 2014 and 2013 the results of our step one testing indicated no impairment therefore the second step of impairment testing was not necessary 

  

the excess of fair value fv over carrying value cv was compared to the carrying value for each reporting unit based on the results shown in the table below and based on our measurement date of august 1 2014 our conclusion is that no indicators of impairment exist in 2014 potential events or circumstances such as a sustained downturn in global economies could have a negative effect on estimated fair values 

 

 the table above does not include two acquisitions that occurred after the august 1 measurement date but before our fiscal yearend we acquired avalon laboratories holding corp “avalon” on august 8 2014 and dima group bv “dima” on august 29 2014 determination of the preliminary goodwill associated with these acquisitions was completed with the assistance of an independent valuation specialist in october 2014 since the dates of the valuations no events or changes in circumstances have occurred that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of these acquisitions below their carrying values for future valuation purposes avalon will be included in the advanced technology systems — fluid management reporting unit and dima will be included in the advanced technology systems — electronics systems reporting unit 

other longlived assets — we test other depreciable and amortizable longlived assets for recoverability in accordance with asc 360 using undiscounted cash flows the total carrying value of longlived assets for each reporting unit has been compared to the forecasted cash flows of each reporting unit’s longlived assets being tested cash flows have been defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization less annual maintenance capital spending 

estimates of future cash flows used to test the recoverability of a longlived asset asset group are based on the remaining useful life of the asset we believe that the relative value of longlived assets within each reporting unit is a reasonable proxy for the relative importance of the assets in the production of cash flow to get to a reasonable forecast period the aggregate net book value of longlived assets was divided by the current depreciation and amortization value to arrive at a blended remaining useful life our calculations for 2014 showed the undiscounted aggregate value of cash flows over the remaining useful life for each reporting unit was greater than the respective carrying value of the longlived assets within each reporting unit so no impairment charges were recognized 

inventories — inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market cost was determined using the lastin firstout lifo method for 21 percent of consolidated inventories at october 31 2014 and october 31 2013 with the firstin firstout fifo method used for the remaining inventory on an ongoing basis inventory is tested for technical obsolescence as well as for future demand and changes in market conditions we have historically maintained inventory reserves to reflect those conditions when the cost of inventory is not expected to be recovered reserves are also maintained for inventory used for demonstration purposes the inventory reserve balance was 26744 26579 and 20505 at october 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

pension plans and postretirement medical plans — the measurement of liabilities related to our pension plans and postretirement medical plans is based on management’s assumptions related to future factors including interest rates return on pension plan assets compensation increases mortality and turnover assumptions and health care cost trend rates 

the weightedaverage discount rate used to determine the present value of our domestic pension plan obligations was 429 percent at october 31 2014 and 475 percent at october 31 2013 the weightedaverage discount rate used to determine the present value of our various international pension plan obligations was 294 percent at october 31 2014 compared to 372 percent at october 31 2013 the discount rates used for all plans were determined by using quality fixed income investments with a duration period approximately equal to the period over which pension obligations are expected to be settled 

  

in determining the expected return on plan assets we consider both historical performance and an estimate of future longterm rates of return on assets similar to those in our plans we consult with and consider the opinions of financial and actuarial experts in developing appropriate return assumptions the expected rate of return longterm investment rate on domestic pension assets used to determine net benefit costs was 724 percent in 2014 and 2013 the average expected rate of return on international pension assets used to determine net benefit costs was 460 percent in 2014 and 443 percent in 2013 

the assumed rate of compensation increases used to determine the present value of our domestic pension plan obligations was 349 percent at october 31 2014 compared to 330 percent at october 31 2013 the assumed rate of compensation increases used to determine the present value of our international pension plan obligations was 319 percent at october 31 2014 compared to 318 percent at october 31 2013 

the measurement of domestic pension and other post employment benefit opeb plans’ projected benefit obligations included the effects of adopting the society of actuaries’ release of final rp2014  mp2014 mortality tables the adoption of these new tables resulted in an increase to our domestic pension and opeb plans’ projected benefit obligations of 28554 and 4878 respectively 

annual expense amounts are determined based on the discount rate used at the end of the prior year differences between actual and assumed investment returns on pension plan assets result in actuarial gains or losses that are amortized into expense over a period of years 

with respect to the domestic postretirement medical plan the discount rate used to value the benefit plan was 440 percent at october 31 2014 and 480 percent at october 31 2013 the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the health care cost trend rate is assumed to be 393 percent in 2015 decreasing gradually to 341 percent in 2024 

for the international postretirement plan the discount rate used to value the benefit obligation was 425 percent at october 31 2014 and 495 percent at october 31 2013 the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the health care cost trend rate is assumed to be 648 percent in 2015 decreasing gradually to 350 percent in 2031 

employees hired after january 1 2002 are not eligible to participate in the domestic postretirement medical plan 

pension and postretirement expenses in 2015 are expected to be approximately 4000 higher than 2014 primarily due to changes in discount rates and the new mortality tables used for domestic plans 

income taxes — income taxes are estimated based on income for financial reporting purposes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes and certain changes in valuation allowances we provide valuation allowances against deferred tax assets if based on available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

management believes the valuation allowances are adequate after considering future taxable income allowable carryforward periods and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize the deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount including the valuation allowance an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made conversely should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be expensed in the period such determination was made 

further at each interim reporting period we estimate an effective income tax rate that is expected to be applicable for the full year significant judgment is involved regarding the application of global income tax laws and regulations and when projecting the jurisdictional mix of income additionally interpretation of tax laws court decisions or other guidance provided by taxing authorities influences our estimate of the effective income tax rates as a result our actual effective income tax rates and related income tax liabilities may differ materially from our estimated effective tax rates and related income tax liabilities any resulting differences are recorded in the period they become known 

  

financial instruments — assets liabilities and commitments that are to be settled in cash and are denominated in foreign currencies are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates we enter into foreign currency forward contracts which are derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of foreign currency exposures resulting from the collection of receivables payables and loans denominated in foreign currencies the maturities of these contracts are usually less than 90 days forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and therefore are marked to market each accounting period and the resulting gains or losses are included in “other–net” within other income expense in the consolidated statement of income 

warranties — we provide customers with a product warranty that requires us to repair or replace defective products within a specified period of time generally one year from the date of delivery or first use an accrual is recorded for expected warranty costs for products shipped through the end of each accounting period in determining the amount of the accrual we rely primarily on historical warranty claims amounts charged to the warranty reserve were 10813 7891 and 5430 in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the reserve balance was 9918 9409 and 8929 at october 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

performance share incentive awards — executive officers and selected other key employees are eligible to receive share awards with payouts based on corporate performance over threeyear periods award payouts vary based on the degree to which corporate performance equals or exceeds predetermined threshold target and maximum performance levels at the end of a performance period no award payout will occur unless certain threshold performance levels are equaled or exceeded the amount of compensation expense is based upon current performance projections for each threeyear performance period and the percentage of the requisite service that has been rendered the calculations are also based upon the grant date fair value determined using the closing market price of nordson common stock at the grant date reduced by the implied value of dividends not to be paid awards are recorded as capital in excess of stated value in shareholders’ equity the cumulative amount recorded at october 31 2014 for the plans originating in 2012 2013 and 2014 was 7570 compensation expense attributable to all performance share incentive award periods for executive officers and selected other key employees for 2014 2013 and 2012 was 4304 3588 and 4235 respectively

recently issued accounting standards — in july 2013 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standards update asu which requires the netting of unrecognized tax benefits against a deferred tax asset for a loss or other carry forward that would apply in settlement of uncertain tax positions under the new standard unrecognized tax benefits will be netted against all available samejurisdiction loss or other tax carry forwards that would be utilized rather than only against carry forwards that are created by the unrecognized tax benefits the new guidance is effective prospectively to all existing unrecognized tax benefits but entities can choose to apply it retrospectively the guidance will be effective for us in our first quarter of 2015 with early adoption permitted we do not believe the adoption of this asu will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

in may 2014 the fasb issued a new standard regarding revenue recognition under this standard a company recognizes revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the standard implements a fivestep process for customer contract revenue recognition that focuses on transfer of control it will be effective for us beginning in 2018 with early adoption not permitted entities can transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulativeeffect adjustment as of the date of adoption we are currently assessing the impact this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements as well as the method by which we will adopt the new standard

see note 8 for additional information 

4 pension and postretirement plan funding amounts after 2015 will be determined based on the future funded status of the plans and therefore cannot be estimated at this time see note 6 for additional information 

5 purchase obligations primarily represent commitments for materials used in our manufacturing processes that are not recorded in our consolidated balance sheet 

we believe that the combination of present capital resources internally generated funds and unused financing sources are more than adequate to meet cash requirements for 2015 there are no significant restrictions limiting the transfer of funds from international subsidiaries to the parent company 

outlook 

our operating performance balance sheet position and financial ratios for 2014 remained strong relative to 2013 and recent years although uncertainties persisted in global financial markets and the general economic environment going forward we are wellpositioned to manage our liquidity needs that arise from working capital requirements capital expenditures contributions related to pension and postretirement obligations and principal and interest payments on indebtedness primary sources of capital to meet these needs as well as other opportunistic investments are cash provided by operations and borrowings under our loan agreements in 2014 cash from operations was 17 percent of revenue with respect to borrowing under existing loan agreements as of october 31 2014 we had 124758 available capacity under our fiveyear term 500000 unsecured multicurrency credit facility in addition we had 121666 borrowing capacity remaining on our 175000 threeyear private shelf agreement with new york life investment management llc while these facilities provide the contractual terms for any borrowing we cannot be assured that these facilities would be available in the event that these financial institutions failed to remain sufficiently capitalized 

other loan agreements exist with no remaining borrowing capacity but factor into debt covenant calculations that affect future borrowing capacity on july 26 2012 we entered into a note purchase agreement with a group of insurance companies under which we sold 200000 of senior notes the notes mature between july 2017 and july 2025 and bear interest at fixed rates between 227 percent and 313 percent as of october 31 2014 we owe €50500 on a €100000 threeyear term loan facility entered into on august 30 2013 with the bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj ltd this loan facility bears interest at variable margin rates of 075 percent to 1625 percent above eur libor as of august 6 2014 we entered into a 100000 364day term loan facility with pnc bank national association rate on this loan is 75 basis points over libor 

respective to all of these loans are two primary covenants the leverage ratio that restricts indebtedness net of cash to a maximum 350 times consolidated fourquarter trailing ebitda and the interest coverage ratio that requires fourquarter trailing ebitda to be at minimum 275 times consolidated trailing fourquarter interest expense debt ebitda and interest expense are as defined in respective credit agreements with respect to these two primary covenants as of october 31 2014 we were approximately 47 percent of the most restrictive leverage ratio and approximately nine times the most restrictive interest coverage ratio unused borrowing capacity under existing loan agreements would amount to an additional 15 percent of the most restrictive leverage ratio 

  

regarding expectations for 2015 we are optimistic about the growth opportunities in the diverse consumer durable nondurable medical electronics and industrial end markets we serve however we move forward with caution given slower growth in emerging markets economists’ expectations for global gdp indicating a lowgrowth macroeconomic environment and marketplace effects of political instability in certain areas of the world though the pace of improvement in the global economy remains somewhat unclear our growth potential has been demonstrated over time from our capacity to build and enhance our core by entering emerging markets and pursuing market adjacencies we drive value for our customers through our application expertise differentiated technology and direct sales and service support our priorities also focus on operational improvements by employing continuous improvement methodologies to our business processes we expect these efforts will continue to provide more than sufficient cash from operations for meeting our liquidity needs and paying dividends to common shareholders as well as enabling us to invest in the development of new applications and markets for our technologies and pursue strategic acquisition opportunities for 2009 — 2014 excluding voluntary contributions to us defined benefit plans in 2010 cash from operations have been 17 to 21 percent of revenues resulting in more than sufficient cash for our ordinary business requirements our available borrowing capacity will enable us to make opportunistic investments in our own common shares and strategic business combinations 

with respect to contractual spending the table above presents our financial obligations as 989631 of which 223865 is payable in 2015 effective december 16 2014 we have in place a share repurchase program approved by the board of directors authorizing management at its discretion to repurchase shares up to 300000 

this new authorization continues a succession of share repurchase programs authorized since 2011 the repurchase program is funded using cash from operations and proceeds from borrowings under our credit facilities timing and actual number of shares subject to repurchase are contingent on a number of factors including levels of cash generation from operations cash requirements for acquisitions repayment of debt and our share price capital expenditures for 2015 will be focused on continued investments in our information systems completing a new facility in colorado supporting our fluid management product lines and projects that improve both capacity and efficiency of manufacturing and distribution operations 

effects of foreign currency 

the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on sales and operating results cannot be precisely measured due to fluctuating selling prices sales volume product mix and cost structures in each country where we operate as a general rule a weakening of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies has a favorable effect on sales and net income while a strengthening of the dollar has a detrimental effect 

in 2014 as compared with 2013 the united states dollar was generally stronger against foreign currencies if 2013 exchange rates had been in effect during 2014 sales would have been approximately 7002 higher and thirdparty costs would have been approximately 1845 higher in 2013 as compared with 2012 the united states dollar was generally stronger against foreign currencies if 2012 exchange rates had been in effect during 2013 sales would have been approximately 15052 higher and thirdparty costs would have been approximately 7035 higher these effects on reported sales do not include the impact of local price adjustments made in response to changes in currency exchange rates 

inflation 

inflation affects profit margins as the ability to pass cost increases on to customers is restricted by the need for competitive pricing although inflation has been modest in recent years and has had no material effect on the years covered by these financial statements we continue to seek ways to minimize the impact of inflation through focused efforts to increase productivity 

trends 

the fiveyear summary in item 6 documents our historical financial trends over this period the world’s economic conditions fluctuated significantly our solid performance is attributed to our participation in diverse geographic and industrial markets and our longterm commitment to develop and provide quality products and worldwide service to meet our customers’ changing needs

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we operate internationally and enter into intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies consequently we are subject to market risk arising from exchange rate movements between the dates foreign currencies are recorded and the dates they are settled we regularly use foreign exchange contracts to reduce our risks related to most of these transactions these contracts primarily associated with the euro yen and pound sterling typically have maturities of 90 days or less and generally require the exchange of foreign currencies for united states dollars at rates stated in the contracts gains and losses from changes in the market value of these contracts offset foreign exchange losses and gains respectively on the underlying transactions other transactions denominated in foreign currencies are designated as hedges of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries or are intercompany transactions of a longterm investment nature as a result of the use of foreign exchange contracts on a routine basis to reduce the risks related to most of our transactions denominated in foreign currencies as of october 31 2014 we did not have material foreign currency exposure

senior operating executives supervise an extensive quality control program for our equipment machinery and systems 

natural gas and other fuels are our primary energy sources however standby capacity for alternative sources is available if needed 




 item 1a risk factors tableend in an enterprise as diverse as ours a wide range of factors could affect future performance we discuss in this section some of the risk factors that if they actually occurred could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition value and results of operations you should consider these risk factors in connection with evaluating the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k because these factors could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected in forwardlooking statements 

the significant risk factors affecting our operations include the following 

changes in united states or international economic conditions could adversely affect the profitability of any of our operations 

in 2013 approximately 30 percent of our revenue was derived from domestic customers while approximately 70 percent was derived from international customers our largest markets include appliance automotive construction container electronics assembly food and beverage furniture life sciences and medical metal finishing nonwovens packaging paper and paperboard converting plastics processing and semiconductor a slowdown in any of these specific end markets could directly affect our revenue stream and profitability 

a portion of our product sales is attributable to industries and markets such as the semiconductor and metal finishing industries which historically have been cyclical and sensitive to relative changes in supply and demand and general economic conditions the demand for our products depends in part on the general economic conditions of the industries or national economies of our customers downward economic cycles in our customers’ industries or countries may reduce sales of some of our products it is not possible to predict accurately the factors that will affect demand for our products in the future 

any significant downturn in the health of the general economy globally regionally or in the markets in which we sell products could have an adverse effect on our revenues and financial performance resulting in impairment of assets 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions and we may not be able to execute on our acquisition strategy or integrate acquisitions successfully 

our recent historical growth has depended and our future growth is likely to continue to depend in part on our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses into our existing operations we intend to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world we cannot assure however that we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition opportunities prevail against competing potential acquirers negotiate appropriate acquisition terms obtain financing that may be needed to consummate such acquisitions complete proposed acquisitions successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new markets in addition we cannot assure that any acquisition once successfully integrated will perform as planned be accretive to earnings or prove to be beneficial to our operations and cash flow 

the success of our acquisition strategy is subject to other risks and uncertainties including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

in addition an acquisition could adversely impact our operating performance as a result of the incurrence of acquisitionrelated debt acquisition expenses the amortization of acquisitionacquired assets or possible future impairments of goodwill or intangible assets associated with the acquisition 

we may also face liability with respect to acquired businesses for violations of environmental laws occurring prior to the date of our acquisition and some or all of these liabilities may not be covered by environmental insurance secured to mitigate the risk or by indemnification from the sellers from which we acquired these businesses we could also incur significant costs including but not limited to remediation costs natural resources damages civil or criminal fines and sanctions and thirdparty claims as a result of past or future violations of or liabilities associated with environmental laws 

failure to retain our existing senior management team or the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could hurt our business and inhibit our ability to operate and grow successfully 

our success will continue to depend to a significant extent on the continued service of our executive management team and the ability to recruit hire and retain other key management personnel to support our growth and operational initiatives and replace executives who retire or resign failure to retain our leadership team and attract and retain other important management and technical personnel could place a constraint on our global growth and operational initiatives possibly resulting in inefficient and ineffective management and operations which would likely harm our revenues operations and product development efforts and eventually result in a decrease in profitability 

if we fail to develop new products or our customers do not accept the new products we develop our revenue and profitability could be adversely impacted 

innovation is critical to our success we believe that we must continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and manufacture new products with improved capabilities in order to continue to be a leading provider of precision technology solutions for the industrial equipment market we also believe that we must continue to make improvements in our productivity in order to maintain our competitive position difficulties or delays in research development or production of new products or failure to gain market acceptance of new products and technologies may reduce future sales and adversely affect our competitive position we continue to invest in the development and marketing of new products there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses if we fail to make innovations launch products with quality problems or the market does not accept our new products our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected in addition as new or enhanced products are introduced we must successfully manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption in customers’ ordering patterns avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that we can deliver sufficient supplies of new products to meet customers’ demands 

if our intellectual property protection is inadequate others may be able to use our technologies and tradenames and thereby reduce our ability to compete which could have a material adverse effect on us our financial condition and results of operations 

we regard much of the technology underlying our products and the trademarks under which we market our products as proprietary the steps we take to protect our proprietary technology may be inadequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or third parties may independently develop similar technology we rely on a combination of patents trademark copyright and trade secret laws employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and other contracts to establish and protect our technology and other intellectual property rights the agreements may be breached or terminated and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach and existing trade secrets patent and copyright law afford us limited protection policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult a third party could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization litigation may be necessary for us to defend against claims of infringement or to protect our intellectual property rights and could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our efforts further we might not prevail in such litigation which could harm our business 

  

our products could infringe on the intellectual property of others which may cause us to engage in costly litigation and if we are not successful could cause us to pay substantial damages and prohibit us from selling our products 

third parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us based on their patents or other intellectual property claims and we may have to pay substantial damages possibly including treble damages if it is ultimately determined that our products infringe we may have to obtain a license to sell our products if it is determined that our products infringe upon another party’s intellectual property we might be prohibited from selling our products before we obtain a license which if available at all may require us to pay substantial royalties even if infringement claims against us are without merit defending these types of lawsuits takes significant time may be expensive and may divert management attention from other business concerns 

any impairment in the value of our intangible assets including goodwill would negatively affect our operating results and total capitalization 

our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets primarily goodwill the goodwill results from our acquisitions and represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the identifiable net assets we acquired we assess at least annually whether there has been any impairment in the value of our intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels if competing or alternative technologies emerge if market conditions for acquired businesses decline if significant and prolonged negative industry or economic trends exist if our stock price and market capitalization declines or if future cash flow estimates decline we could incur under current applicable accounting rules a noncash charge to operating earnings for goodwill impairment any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and equity book value the effect of which could be material 

significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates or change in monetary policy may harm our financial results 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly with respect to the euro the yen the pound sterling and the chinese yuan any significant change in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business against the united states dollar could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for additional detail related to this risk see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

the majority of our consolidated revenues in 2013 were generated in currencies other than the united states dollar which is our reporting currency we recognize foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from our operations in the period incurred as a result currency fluctuations between the united states dollar and the currencies in which we do business have caused and will continue to cause foreign currency transaction and translation gains and losses which historically have been material and could continue to be material we cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future operating results because of the number of currencies involved the variability of currency exposures and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates we take actions to manage our foreign currency exposure such as entering into hedging transactions where available but we cannot assure that our strategies will adequately protect our consolidated operating results from the effects of exchange rate fluctuations 

we also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into united states dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or customers located in or conducting business in a country imposing controls currency devaluations diminish the united states dollar value of the currency of the country instituting the devaluation and if they occur or continue for significant periods could adversely affect our earnings or cash flow 

  

inability to access capital could impede growth or the repayment or refinancing of existing indebtedness 

the limits imposed on us by the restrictive covenants contained in our credit facilities could prevent us from making acquisitions or cause us to lose access to these facilities 

our existing credit facilities contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition our credit facilities require us to meet financial ratios including “total indebtedness” to “consolidated trailing earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization” ebitda both as defined in the credit facility and consolidated trailing ebitda to consolidated trailing interest expense as defined in the credit facility 

these restrictions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs and could otherwise restrict our financing activities 

our ability to comply with the covenants and other terms of our credit facilities will depend on our future operating performance if we fail to comply with such covenants and terms we will be in default and the maturity of the related debt could be accelerated and become immediately due and payable we may be required to obtain waivers from our lenders in order to maintain compliance under our credit facilities including waivers with respect to our compliance with certain financial covenants if we are unable to obtain necessary waivers and the debt under our credit facilities is accelerated we would be required to obtain replacement financing at prevailing market rates 

we may need new or additional financing in the future to expand our business or refinance existing indebtedness if we are unable to access capital on satisfactory terms and conditions we may not be able to expand our business or meet our payment requirements under our existing credit facilities our ability to obtain new or additional financing will depend on a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control we may not be able to obtain new or additional financing because we have substantial debt or because we may not have sufficient cash flow to service or repay our existing or future debt in addition depending on market conditions and our financial performance neither debt nor equity financing may be available on satisfactory terms or at all finally as a consequence of worsening financial market conditions our credit facility providers may not provide the agreed credit if they become undercapitalized 

rapid changes in interest rates could adversely affect us 

any period of unexpected or rapid increase in interest rates may also adversely affect our profitability at october 31 2013 we had 652594 of total debt and notes payable outstanding of which 59 percent was priced at interest rates that float with the market a one percent increase in the interest rate on the floating rate debt in 2013 would have resulted in approximately 3464 of additional interest expense a higher level of floating rate debt would increase the exposure to changes in interest rates for additional detail related to this risk see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

  

the level of returns on pension plan assets and changes in the actuarial assumptions used could adversely affect us 

our operating results may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of expense we record for our defined benefit pension plans us gaap requires that we calculate pension expense using actuarial valuations which are dependent upon our various assumptions including estimates of expected longterm rate of return on plan assets discount rates for future payment obligations and the expected rate of increase in future compensation levels our pension expense and funding requirements may also be affected by our actual return on plan assets and by legislation and other government regulatory actions changes in assumptions laws or regulations could lead to variability in operating results and could have a material adverse impact on liquidity 

new regulations related to conflictfree minerals may result in additional expenses that could affect our financial condition and business operations 

pursuant to the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the sec promulgated final rules regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals known as conflict minerals which are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries as well as procedures regarding a manufacturer’s efforts to prevent the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from those minerals these new disclosure obligations will require due diligence efforts to support our initial disclosure requirements effective in may 2014 we will incur costs associated with complying with such disclosure requirements including costs associated with canvassing our supply chain to determine the source country of any conflict minerals incorporated in our products in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities in addition the implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products 

political conditions in foreign countries in which we operate could adversely affect us 

we conduct our manufacturing sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and are subject to risks associated with doing business outside the united states in 2013 approximately 70 percent of our total sales were to customers outside the united states we expect that international operations and united states export sales will continue to be important to our business for the foreseeable future both sales from international operations and export sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside the united states such risks include but are not limited to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any of these events could reduce the demand for our products limit the prices at which we can sell our products or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operating performance 

  

our international operations also depend upon favorable trade relations between the us and those foreign countries in which our customers subcontractors and materials suppliers have operations a protectionist trade environment in either the us or those foreign countries in which we do business such as a change in the current tariff structures export compliance or other trade policies may materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our products in foreign markets 

our business and operating results may be adversely affected by natural disasters or other catastrophic events beyond our control 

while we have taken precautions to prevent production and service interruptions at our global facilities severe weather conditions such as hurricanes or tornadoes as well major earthquakes and other natural disasters in areas in which we have manufacturing facilities or from which we obtain products may cause physical damage to our properties closure of one or more of our manufacturing or distribution facilities lack of an adequate work force in a market temporary disruption in the supply of inventory disruption in the transport of products and utilities and delays in the delivery of products to our customers any of these factors may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

the insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures 

we maintain property business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered we are potentially at risk if one or more of our insurance carriers fail additionally severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the ratings and survival of some insurers in the future we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend we are involved in pending or potential litigation regarding environmental product liability patent contract employee and other matters arising from the normal course of business including the environmental matter discussed below it is our opinion after consultation with legal counsel that resolutions of these matters are not expected to result in a material effect on our financial condition quarterly or annual operating results or cash flows 

environmental — we have voluntarily agreed with the city of new richmond wisconsin and other potentially responsible parties to share costs associated with the remediation of the city of new richmond municipal landfill the “site” and constructing a potable water delivery system serving the impacted area down gradient of the site at october 31 2013 and 2012 our accrual for the ongoing operation maintenance and monitoring obligation at the site was 668 and 750 respectively 

the liability for environmental remediation represents management’s best estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable undiscounted costs related to known remediation obligations the accuracy of our estimate of environmental liability is affected by several uncertainties such as additional requirements that may be identified in connection with remedial activities the complexity and evolution of environmental laws and regulations and the identification of presently unknown remediation requirements consequently our liability could be greater than our current estimate however we do not expect that the costs associated with remediation will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses on an ongoing basis we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that are used to prepare financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates used by management 

certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below on a regular basis critical accounting policies are reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 

revenue recognition — most of our revenues are recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the sales price is fixed or determinable collectability is reasonably assured and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer the fasb has issued guidance on multiple deliverable arrangements that establishes a relative selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available thirdparty evidence tpe if vendorspecific objective evidence is not available or best estimated selling price besp if neither vendorspecific objective evidence nor thirdparty evidence is available our multiple deliverable arrangements include installation installation supervision training and spare parts which tend to be completed in a short period of time at an insignificant cost and utilizing skills not unique to us and therefore are typically regarded as inconsequential or perfunctory revenue for undelivered items is deferred and included within accrued liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet revenues deferred in 2013 2012 and 2011 were not material 

goodwill — goodwill is the excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in various business combinations goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level or more often if indications of impairment exist our reporting units are the adhesive dispensing systems segment the industrial coating systems segment and one level below the advanced technology systems segment 

we test goodwill in accordance with accounting standards codification asc 350 the goodwill impairment test is a twostep process in the first step performed in the fourth quarter of each year we calculate a reporting unit’s fair value using a discounted cash flow valuation methodology and compare the result against the reporting unit’s carrying value of net assets if the carrying value of a reporting unit is close to or exceeds its fair value then a second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired we used independent valuation specialists to assist with refining our assumptions and methods used to determine fair values using discounted cash flow dcf methodology for our reporting units and other longlived assets and to prepare indications of value derived from a market approach using guideline companies and a reconciliation to results of the dcf approach in step one the assumptions used for discounted cash flow revenue growth operating margin and working capital turnover are based on general management’s strategic plans tempered by performance trends and reasonable expectations about those trends terminal value calculations employ a published formula known as the “gordon growth model method” that essentially captures the present value of perpetual cash flows beyond the last projected period assuming a constant weighted average cost of capital wacc methodology and growth 

  

rate for each reporting unit a sensitivity analysis is performed to vary the discount and terminal growth rates in order to provide a range of reasonableness that our expected assumptions are fair for detecting impairment 

discount rates are developed using a wacc methodology the wacc represents the blended average required rate of return for equity and debt capital based on observed market return data and company specific risk factors for 2013 the discount rates used ranged from 10 percent to 19 percent depending upon the reporting unit’s size end market volatility and projection risk the calculated internal rate of return for the step one consolidated valuation was 11 percent the same as the calculated wacc for total nordson 

to test the reasonableness of the discounted cash flow valuations we performed the control premium test which compares the sum of the fair values calculated for our reporting units net of debt to the market value of equity the control premium was negative 17 percent as of the test date of august 1 2013 and october 31 2013 the control premium indicated that the discounted cash flow valuation was reasonable in addition indications of value derived for each reporting unit using the market approach reconciled reasonably with the results of the discounted cash flow approach 

in 2013 and 2012 the results of our step one testing indicated no impairment therefore the second step of impairment testing was not necessary 

the excess of fair value fv over carrying value cv was compared to the carrying value for each reporting unit based on the results shown in the table below and based on our measurement date of august 1 2013 our conclusion is that no indicators of impairment exist in 2013 potential events or circumstances such as a sustained downturn in global economies could have a negative effect on estimated fair values 

 

 the table above does not include two acquisitions that occurred after the august 1 measurement date but before our fiscal yearend we acquired the kreyenborg group’s kreyenborg gmbh and bkg bruckmann  kreyenborg granuliertechnik gmbh “the kreyenborg group” on august 30 2013 and certain assets from nellcor puritan bennett mexico sa de cv a subsidiary of covidien lp on september 27 2013 determination of the preliminary goodwill associated with these acquisitions was completed with the assistance of independent valuation specialists in october 2013 since the dates of the valuations no events or changes in circumstances have occurred that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of these acquisitions below their carrying values for future valuation purposes the kreyenborg group will be included in our adhesive dispensing systems segment and the assets acquired from nellcor will be included in advanced technology systems — fluid management 

other longlived assets — we test other depreciable and amortizable longlived assets for recoverability in accordance with asc 360 using undiscounted cash flows longlived assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows the total carrying value of longlived assets for each reporting unit has been compared to the forecasted cash flows of each reporting unit’s longlived assets being tested cash flows have been defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization less annual maintenance capital spending 

estimates of future cash flows used to test the recoverability of a longlived asset asset group are based on the remaining useful life of the asset we believe that the relative value of longlived assets within each reporting unit is a reasonable proxy for the relative importance of the assets in the production of cash flow to get to a reasonable forecast period the aggregate net book value of longlived assets was divided by the current depreciation and amortization value to arrive at a blended remaining useful life our calculations for 2013 showed the undiscounted aggregate value of cash flows over the remaining useful life for each reporting unit was greater than the respective carrying value of the longlived assets within each reporting unit so no impairment charges were recognized 

  

inventories — inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market cost was determined using the lastin firstout lifo method for 21 percent of consolidated inventories at october 31 2013 and 24 percent at october 31 2012 with the firstin firstout fifo method used for the remaining inventory on an ongoing basis inventory is tested for technical obsolescence as well as for future demand and changes in market conditions we have historically maintained inventory reserves to reflect those conditions when the cost of inventory is not expected to be recovered reserves are also maintained for inventory used for demonstration purposes the inventory reserve balance was 26579 20505 and 16050 at october 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

pension plans and postretirement medical plans — the measurement of liabilities related to our pension plans and postretirement medical plans is based on management’s assumptions related to future factors including interest rates return on pension plan assets compensation increases mortality and turnover assumptions and health care cost trend rates 

the weightedaverage discount rate used to determine the present value of our domestic pension plan obligations was 475 percent at october 31 2013 and 385 percent at october 31 2012 the weightedaverage discount rate used to determine the present value of our various international pension plan obligations was 372 percent at october 31 2013 compared to 352 percent at october 31 2012 the discount rates used for all plans were determined by using quality fixed income investments with a duration period approximately equal to the period over which pension obligations are expected to be settled 

in determining the expected return on plan assets we consider both historical performance and an estimate of future longterm rates of return on assets similar to those in our plans we consult with and consider the opinions of financial and actuarial experts in developing appropriate return assumptions the expected rate of return longterm investment rate on domestic pension assets used to determine net benefit costs was 724 percent in 2013 and 775 percent in 2012 the average expected rate of return on international pension assets used to determine net benefit costs was 443 percent in 2013 and 485 percent in 2012 

the assumed rate of compensation increases used to determine the present value of our domestic pension plan obligations was 330 percent at october 31 2013 and october 31 2012 the assumed rate of compensation increases used to determine the present value of our international pension plan obligations was 318 percent at october 31 2013 compared to 313 percent at october 31 2012 

annual expense amounts are determined based on the discount rate used at the end of the prior year differences between actual and assumed investment returns on pension plan assets result in actuarial gains or losses that are amortized into expense over a period of years 

economic assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported the effect of a one percent change in the discount rate expected return on assets and compensation increase is shown in the table below bracketed numbers represent decreases in expense and obligation amounts 

 

   

with respect to the domestic postretirement medical plan the discount rate used to value the benefit plan was 480 percent at october 31 2013 and 385 percent at october 31 2012 the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the health care cost trend rate is assumed to be 412 percent in 2014 decreasing gradually to 347 percent in 2021 

for the international postretirement plan the discount rate used to value the benefit obligation was 495 percent at october 31 2013 and 440 percent at october 31 2012 the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the health care cost trend rate is assumed to be 665 percent in 2014 decreasing gradually to 350 percent in 2031 

the discount rate and the health care cost trend rate assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported for example a onepercentage point change in the discount rate and assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects 

 

 employees hired after january 1 2002 are not eligible to participate in the domestic postretirement medical plan 

pension and postretirement expenses in 2014 are expected to be approximately 5257 lower than 2013 primarily due to changes in discount rates 

financial instruments — assets liabilities and commitments that are to be settled in cash and are denominated in foreign currencies are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates we enter into foreign currency forward contracts which are derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of foreign currency exposures resulting from the collection of receivables payables and loans denominated in foreign currencies the maturities of these contracts are usually less than 90 days forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and therefore are marked to market each accounting period and the resulting gains or losses are included in “other–net” within other income expense in the consolidated statement of income 

warranties — we provide customers with a product warranty that requires us to repair or replace defective products within a specified period of time generally one year from the date of delivery or first use an accrual is recorded for expected warranty costs for products shipped through the end of each accounting period in determining the amount of the accrual we rely primarily on historical warranty claims amounts charged to the warranty reserve were 7891 5430 and 7417 in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the reserve balance was 9409 8929 and 6723 at october 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

longterm incentive plan ltip — under the longterm incentive plan executive officers and selected other key employees receive share awards based on corporate performance measures over threeyear performance periods awards vary based on the degree to which corporate performance equals or exceeds predetermined threshold target and maximum performance levels at the end of a performance period no award will occur unless certain threshold performance objectives are equaled or exceeded the amount of compensation expense is based upon current performance projections for each threeyear period and the percentage of the requisite service that has been rendered the calculations are also based upon the grant date fair value determined using the closing market price of common stock at the grant date reduced by the implied value of dividends not to be paid awards are recorded as capital in excess of stated value in shareholders’ equity the cumulative amount recorded at october 31 2013 for the plans originating in 2011 2012 and 2013 was 8083 

compensation expense attributable to all ltip performance periods for executive officers and selected other key employees for 2013 2012 and 2011 was 3588 4235 and 4067 respectively 

  

2013 compared to 2012 

sales — worldwide sales for 2013 were 1542921 an increase of 95 percent from 2012 sales of 1409578 sales volume increased 106 percent and unfavorable currency effects caused by the stronger us dollar primarily against the japanese yen reduced sales by 11 percent the volume increase consisted of 102 percent from acquisitions and 04 percent from organic growth three acquisitions were made during 2013 the kreyenborg group and certain assets of kodama chemical industry co ltd  which were both included within the adhesive dispensing systems segment and certain assets of nellcor puritan bennett mexico sa de cv a subsidiary of covidien lp “nellcor” which was included within the advanced technology systems segment three acquisitions were made during 2012 edi holdings inc edi and xaloy superior holdings inc xaloy which were included within the adhesive dispensing systems segment and sealant equipment  engineering inc see which was included within the industrial coating systems segment 

as used throughout this form 10k geographic regions include the americas canada mexico and central and south america asia pacific excluding japan europe japan and the united states 

sales of the adhesive dispensing systems segment were 793488 in 2013 an increase of 109392 or 160 percent from 2012 sales of 684096 the increase was the result of a sales volume increase of 176 percent offset by unfavorable currency effects that reduced sales by 16 percent the sales volume increase consisted of 188 percent from acquisitions offset by a 12 percent reduction in organic volume sales volume inclusive of acquisitions increased in all geographic regions and was particularly strong in the united states and asia pacific regions growth in our solar applications paper board packaging and certain durable goods markets was partially offset by softness in our plastics processing markets and disposable hygiene product markets 

sales of the advanced technology systems segment were 516266 in 2013 an increase of 274 or 01 percent from 2012 sales of 515992 the increase was the result of a sales volume increase of 03 percent offset by unfavorable currency effects that reduced sales by 02 percent the sales volume increase was solely due to organic growth within the segment volume increases occurred in all geographic regions except asia pacific and were most pronounced in japan growth in our automotive electronics display assembly printed circuit board assembly and medical equipment markets was offset by softness in our semiconductor packaging and industrial assembly end markets 

sales of the industrial coating systems segment were 233167 in 2013 an increase of 23677 or 113 percent from 2012 sales of 209490 the increase was the result of a sales volume increase of 127 percent offset by unfavorable currency effects that reduced sales by 14 percent the sales volume increase consisted of 56 percent organic growth and 71 percent from an acquisition sales volume inclusive of acquisitions increased in the united states americas and japan regions growth in some of our consumer and industrial durable goods markets was offset by softness in our large dollar systems supporting automotive oems and container coating markets 

sales outside the united states accounted for 698 percent of our sales in 2013 versus 724 percent in 2012 on a geographic basis sales in the united states were 465789 an increase of 198 percent from 2012 the increase consisted of 15 percent organic volume and 183 percent from acquisitions in the americas region sales were 123654 up 134 percent from the prior year with volume increasing 148 percent offset by unfavorable currency effects of 14 percent the increase in sales volume consisted of 58 percent organic volume and 90 percent from acquisitions sales in europe were 416725 in 2013 up 94 percent from 2012 with volume increasing 81 and favorable currency effects of 13 percent the increase in sales volume consisted primarily of 80 percent from acquisitions sales in japan for 2013 were 127945 an increase of 03 percent from the prior year the increase consisted of volume of 161 percent offset by unfavorable currency effects of 158 percent the increase in sales volume consisted of 85 percent organic volume and 76 percent from acquisitions sales in the asia pacific region were 408808 up 14 percent from the prior year with volume increasing 09 percent and favorable currency effects of 05 percent the increase in sales volume consisted of 54 percent from acquisitions offset by a decline in organic volume of 45 percent 

it is estimated that the effect of pricing on total revenue was neutral relative to 2012 

  

operating profit — cost of sales including those costs classified as restructuring were 676777 in 2013 up 154 percent from 2012 the increase compared to 2012 is primarily due to increased sales volume gross profit expressed as a percentage of sales decreased to 561 percent in 2013 from 584 percent in 2012 the reduction in gross margin was primarily a result of lower product line margins relating to 2013 and 2012 acquisitions as well as a higher mix of systems revenue in our legacy business and currency effects 

selling and administrative expenses excluding severance and restructuring costs were 541169 in 2013 an increase of 55884 or 115 percent from 2012 the increase was primarily due to the addition of acquired businesses acquisition transaction costs and higher compensation expenses related to increased employment levels partially offset by currency effects that reduced expenses 

selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 351 percent in 2013 from 344 percent in 2012 due primarily to the acquired businesses and modest organic sales volume growth 

severance and restructuring costs of 1126 were recorded during 2013 within the adhesives dispensing systems segment a restructuring program to optimize certain european operations resulted in costs of 315 within the advanced technology systems segment restructuring initiatives that involved plant and facility consolidations and other programs resulted in severance costs of 811 in 2013 

operating profit as a percentage of sales was 210 percent in 2013 compared to 238 percent in 2012 the decrease was primarily due to the dilutive effect of 2013 and 2012 acquisitions as well as modest organic sales growth and higher selling and administrative expenses 

segment operating margins in 2013 and 2012 were as follows 

 

 operating capacity for each of our segments can support fluctuations in order activity without significant changes in operating costs also currency translation affects reported operating margins operating margins for each segment were unfavorably impacted by a stronger dollar during 2013 as compared to 2012 

operating profit as a percentage of sales for the adhesive dispensing systems segment decreased to 257 percent in 2013 from 309 percent in 2012 the decrease was primarily due to the dilutive effect of 2013 and 2012 acquisitions 

operating profit as a percentage of sales for the advanced technology systems segment was 239 percent in 2013 compared to 260 percent in 2012 the decline was partially due to a higher mix of engineered systems serving mobile electronic device customers and incremental spending on initiatives that are intended to drive growth in future periods 

operating profit as a percentage of sales for the industrial coating systems segment was 145 percent in 2013 compared to 124 percent in 2012 the increase was primarily due to better absorption of fixed expenses as well as the accretive effect of a 2012 acquisition 

interest and other income expense — interest expense in 2013 was 14841 an increase of 3688 or 331 percent from 2012 the increase was due to higher borrowing levels resulting primarily from acquisitions in the second half of 2012 and 2013 

other income in 2013 was 1694 compared to 1463 in 2012 included in 2013 were the gain on sale of real estate in china of 2106 and foreign currency losses of 2214 the 2012 amount included a net gain of 713 on the sale of three facilities within the adhesive dispensing systems segment and foreign currency losses of 1016 

income taxes — income tax expense in 2013 was 89306 or 287 percent of pretax income as compared to 101424 or 311 percent of pretax income in 2012 

  

the 2013 rate was impacted by a favorable adjustment to unrecognized tax benefits of 900 primarily related to expiration of certain foreign statutes of limitations on january 2 2013 the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 was enacted which retroactively reinstated and extended the federal research and development tax credit federal rd tax credit from january 1 2012 to december 31 2013 and extended certain other tax provisions as a result the company’s income tax expense for 2013 includes a discrete tax benefit of 1700 related to 2012 

the 2012 tax rate was impacted by a favorable adjustment related to our 2011 tax provision that reduced income taxes by 400 a favorable adjustment to deferred taxes related to a tax rate reduction in the united kingdom that reduced income taxes by 175 and additional tax expense of 325 related to an adjustment of deferred taxes resulting from a tax rate reduction in japan 

net income loss — net income was 221817 or 342 per diluted share in 2013 compared to net income of 224829 or 345 per diluted share in 2012 this represented a 13 percent decrease in net income and a 09 percent decrease in diluted earnings per share 

recently issued accounting standards — in september 2011 the fasb issued guidance amending the way companies test for goodwill impairment companies will have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine the existence of events or circumstances that lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances companies determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount then performing the twostep impairment test is unnecessary this guidance did not change our annual process for goodwill impairment testing or impact the financial statements 

in february 2013 the fasb issued an accounting standards update asu requiring new disclosures for reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income companies are required to present these disclosures either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes to the consolidated financial statements this guidance is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2014 it will only be a change in disclosure so we do not believe the adoption of this asu will have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 

in july 2013 the fasb issued an asu which requires the netting of unrecognized tax benefits against a deferred tax asset for a loss or other carry forward that would apply in settlement of uncertain tax positions under the new standard unrecognized tax benefits will be netted against all available samejurisdiction loss or other tax carry forwards that would be utilized rather than only against carry forwards that are created by the unrecognized tax benefits the new guidance is effective prospectively to all existing unrecognized tax benefits but entities can choose to apply it retrospectively the guidance will be effective for us in our first quarter of 2015 with early adoption permitted we are currently assessing the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements 

2012 compared to 2011 

sales — worldwide sales for 2012 were 1409578 an increase of 143 percent from 2011 sales of 1233159 sales volume increased 164 percent and unfavorable currency effects caused by the stronger us dollar decreased sales by 21 percent the volume increase consisted of 85 percent from acquisitions and 79 percent from organic growth three acquisitions were made during 2012 edi holdings inc edi and xaloy superior holdings inc xaloy which were included within the adhesive dispensing systems segment and sealant equipment  engineering inc see which was included within the industrial coating systems segment three acquisitions were made during 2011 micromedics inc micromedics and value plastics which were included within the advanced technology systems segment and constructiewerkhuizen g verbruggen nv verbruggen which was included within the adhesive dispensing systems segment 

as used throughout this form 10k geographic regions include the americas canada mexico and central and south america asia pacific excluding japan europe japan and the united states 

sales of the adhesive dispensing systems segment were 684096 in 2012 an increase of 72185 or 118 percent from 2011 sales of 611911 the increase was the result of a sales volume increase of 149 percent

sales of the advanced technology systems segment were 515992 in 2012 an increase of 78760 or 180 percent from 2011 sales of 437232 the increase was the result of a sales volume increase of 189 percent offset by unfavorable currency effects that decreased sales by 09 percent the sales volume increase consisted of 139 percent organic growth and 50 percent from acquisitions within the segment volume increases occurred in all geographic regions except europe and were most pronounced in asia pacific volume increases were driven by strong broadbased demand for dispensing and test and inspection in electronics end markets especially for mobile device applications 

in 2012 sales of the industrial coating systems segment were 209490 an increase of 25474 or 138 percent from 2011 sales of 184016 the increase was the result of a sales volume increase of 155 percent offset by unfavorable currency effects that reduced sales by 17 percent the sales volume increase consisted of 133 percent organic growth and 22 percent from an acquisition sales volume increased in all geographic regions except the americas and was most pronounced in the united states the sales volume increase was driven by durable goods manufacturers’ demand for our coating and cold material system solutions 

sales outside the united states accounted for 724 percent of our sales in 2012 versus 747 percent last year on a geographic basis sales in the united states were 388904 an increase of 245 percent from 2011 the increase consisted of 82 percent organic volume and 163 percent from acquisitions in the americas region sales were 109074 up 69 percent from the prior year with volume increasing 113 percent offset by unfavorable currency effects of 44 percent the increase in sales volume consisted of 43 percent organic volume and 70 percent from acquisitions sales in europe were 381005 in 2012 a decrease of 24 percent from 2011 sales volume increases of 36 percent were offset by unfavorable currency effects of 60 percent the increase in sales volume consisted of a decline in organic volume of 31 percent offset by 67 percent from acquisitions sales in japan for 2012 were 127509 an increase of 149 percent from the prior year the increase consisted of volume of 134 percent and favorable currency effects of 15 percent the increase in sales volume consisted of 91 percent organic volume and 43 percent from acquisitions in asia pacific sales were 403086 up 270 percent from 2011 with volume increasing 271 percent partially offset by unfavorable currency effects of 01 percent the increase in sales volume consisted of 222 percent organic volume and 49 percent from acquisitions 

it is estimated that the effect of pricing on total revenue was neutral relative to 2011 

operating profit — cost of sales including those costs classified as restructuring were 586289 in 2012 up 210 percent from 2011 the increase compared to 2011 is primarily due to increased sales volume gross margin expressed as a percentage of sales decreased to 584 percent in 2012 from 607 percent in 2011 gross profit in 2012 was negatively impacted by higher charges for shortterm inventory purchase accounting valuation adjustments related to acquisitions and costs associated with the transfer of production and startup activities related to our united states adhesive dispensing systems plant consolidation initiative the costs associated with the transfer of production and startup activities were classified as “cost of goods sold — restructuring” in the consolidated statement of income other decreases in gross margin in 2012 were due primarily to the dilutive effect of acquired product lines and currency effects 

selling and administrative expenses excluding severance and restructuring costs were 485285 in 2012 an increase of 55796 or 130 percent from 2011 the increase was largely due to the addition of acquired businesses acquisition transaction costs and higher compensation expenses related to increased employment levels partially offset by currency effects that reduced expenses selling and administrative expenses for 2011 included 3120 related to a fee paid to withdraw from a multiemployer employee pension fund in japan 

selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to 344 percent in 2012 from 348 percent in 2011 due to the higher level of sales and the favorable effects of restructuring activities 

within advanced technology systems operations a restructuring initiative in 2012 will result in the consolidation of a facility in florida with a facility in california severance costs associated with this initiative will be approximately 530 of that amount 12 was recorded in 2012 with the remainder to be recorded in 2013 

  

another restructuring initiative in 2012 within industrial coating systems operations in ohio resulted in 690 of severance costs in 2011 restructuring initiatives within the adhesive dispensing systems segment resulted in severance moving costs and other termination fees of 1822 in 2012 and 1589 in 2011 

operating profit as a percent of sales was 238 percent in 2012 compared to 256 percent in 2011 the decrease was primarily due to a lower gross margin as noted above 

segment operating margins in 2012 and 2011 were as follows 

 

 operating capacity for each of our segments can support fluctuations in order activity without significant changes in operating costs also currency translation affects reported operating margins operating margins for each segment were unfavorably impacted by a stronger dollar during 2012 as compared to 2011 

operating profit as a percent of sales for the adhesive dispensing systems segment decreased to 309 percent in 2012 from 344 percent in 2011 the decrease was primarily due to lower gross margin related to charges for shortterm purchase accounting and sales mix primarily related to acquired product lines operating profit in 2012 was also impacted by 2040 of additional cost of sales related to a plant consolidation initiative completed in the second quarter and severance and moving costs of 1822 operating profit for 2011 included impairment losses of 1811 on three facilities that were written down to their fair value and severance costs and other termination fees of 1589 

operating profit as a percent of sales for the advanced technology systems segment was 260 percent in 2012 compared to 262 percent in 2011 operating profit included charges for shortterm purchase accounting of 2213 in 2012 and 3003 in 2011 

operating profit as a percent of sales for the industrial coating systems segment was 124 percent in 2012 compared to 148 percent in 2011 the decrease was primarily due to a lower gross margin related to large engineered systems and charges of 1367 for shortterm purchase accounting 

interest and other income expense — interest expense in 2012 was 11153 an increase of 6084 or 1200 percent from 2011 the increase was due to higher borrowing levels resulting primarily from acquisitions in 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2011 and share repurchases 

other income in 2012 was 1463 compared to 3518 in 2011 included in these amounts were foreign currency losses of 1016 in 2012 and gains of 2200 in 2011 the 2012 amount also included a net gain of 713 on the sale of three facilities within the adhesive dispensing systems segment 

income taxes — income tax expense in 2012 was 101424 or 311 percent of pretax income as compared to 92197 or 293 percent of pretax income in 2011 

the 2012 tax rate was impacted by a favorable adjustment related to our 2011 tax provision that reduced income taxes by 400 a favorable adjustment to deferred taxes related to a tax rate reduction in the united kingdom that reduced income taxes by 175 and additional tax expense of 325 related to an adjustment of deferred taxes resulting from a tax rate reduction in japan 

income tax expense for 2011 includes a benefit of 2027 from a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits primarily related to settlements with tax authorities in december 2010 enactment of the tax relief unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of 2010 provided retroactive reinstatement of a research credit as a result income tax expense for 2011 includes a tax benefit of 1580 related to research credit generated in 2010 

net income loss — net income was 224829 or 345 per diluted share in 2012 compared to net income of 222364 or 325 per diluted share in 2011 this represented a 11 percent increase in net income and a 

  

62 percent increase in diluted earnings per share the percentage increase in earnings per share is higher than the percentage change in net income due to a lower number of shares outstanding in the current year as a result of share purchases 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash and cash equivalents increased 1136 in 2013 cash provided by operating activities was 268376 in 2013 compared to 274398 in 2012 the primary sources were net income adjusted for noncash income and expenses and the tax benefit from the exercise of stock options the sum of which was 287378 in 2013 compared to 278891 in 2012 operating assets and liabilities used 19002 of cash in 2013 compared to 4493 in 2012 the primary reasons for the increase in the use of cash for operating assets and liabilities were higher inventory investment and lower accrued obligations and tax liabilities partially offset by lower accounts receivable 

cash used by investing activities was 220545 in 2013 compared to 466769 in 2012 the 2013 acquisitions of the kreyenborg group certain assets from kodama chemical industry co ltd and certain assets from nellcor puritan bennett mexico sa de cv a subsidiary of covidien lp used 176333 of cash the acquisitions of edi xaloy and see in 2012 used cash of 443864 capital expenditures were 47219 in 2013 up from 30959 in the prior year the increase in capital expenditures in 2013 was primarily due to the purchase of real estate and continued investments in our information system platform and production equipment cash proceeds of 3847 in 2013 related primarily to sale of real estate in china cash proceeds of 6120 from the sale of property plant and equipment in 2012 related primarily to the sale of real estate in norcross georgia cash of 2213 was received in 2012 related to the sale of our uv curing graphic arts and lamps product lines that occurred in june 2010 

cash of 52426 was used by financing activities in 2013 compared to cash provided by financing activities of 196817 in 2012 included in 2013 were net short and longterm borrowings of 15747 compared to 314554 in the prior year the change was primarily due to lower expenditures for acquisitions acquired businesses and assets in 2013 issuance of common shares related to employee benefit plans generated 6018 of cash in 2013 up from 4934 in 2012 and the tax benefit from stock option exercises was 5531 in the current year up from 4792 in the prior year these increases were the result of higher stock option exercises in 2013 cash of 33402 was used for the purchase of treasury shares down from 88455 in 2012 dividend payments were 40478 in 2013 up from 33805 in 2012 due to an increase in the annual dividend to 063 per share from 0525 per share 

the following is a summary of significant changes by balance sheet caption from october 31 2012 to october 31 2013 receivables decreased 15856 primarily due to lower sales in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to the fourth quarter of 2012 the increase of 28816 in inventories was primarily due to inventory held by the kreyenborg group which was acquired in 2013 net property plant and equipment increased 26048 primarily due to capital expenditures and acquisitions partially offset by depreciation expense goodwill increased 126394 due to acquisitions completed in 2013 that added 117404 of goodwill adjustments of 4825 related to 2012 acquisitions and 4165 from the effects currency translation the increase in net other intangibles of 41182 was due to 62983 of intangibles added as a result of the 2013 acquisitions partially offset by 22672 of amortization the increase of 5203 in other assets was primarily the result of the kreyenborg group acquisition 

the decrease in notes payable of 46397 was related to the scheduled repayment of a 50000 shortterm credit facility with pnc bank accounts payable decreased 5320 primarily due to the lower level of business activity in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to the fourth quarter of 2012 the decrease in income taxes payable of 12832 was largely due to the timing of required tax payments the decrease of 6848 in accrued liabilities was primarily due to the timing of donations to the nordson corporation foundation and lower accruals for annual incentive compensation the 7447 increase in customer advanced payments was mostly due to acquired businesses current maturities of longterm debt decreased 44836 as a result of the scheduled repayment of our 50000 prudential senior note in february 2013 partially offset by a reclassification from longterm debt the longterm debt increase of 110117 reflects 129058 borrowed under a euro 100000 agreement with the bank of tokyomitsubishi ufj ltd partially offset by repayments of 8450 under our revolving credit 

  

agreement and the reclassification from longterm to current maturities mentioned above the 57645 decrease in longterm pension obligations was primarily the result of an increase in the discount rate for us plans and contributions to the plans postretirement obligations decreased 10057 primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate for the us plan longterm deferred tax liabilities increased 53818 primarily as a result of the tax effect of pension and postretirement amounts recorded in other comprehensive income 2013 acquisitions and amortization of goodwill for tax purposes the increase of 7494 in other longterm liabilities was traced primarily to the kreyenborg group acquisition 

in march 2012 the board of directors approved a repurchase program of up to 100000 in august 2013 the board of directors replaced that program with a new repurchase program of up to 200000 uses for repurchased shares include the funding of benefit programs including stock options restricted stock and 401k matching shares purchased are treated as treasury shares until used for such purposes the repurchase program is being funded using cash from operations and proceeds from borrowings under our credit facilities during 2013 we repurchased 459 shares within these programs for a total amount of 30443 

as of october 31 2013 approximately 79 percent of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents were held at various foreign subsidiaries deferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries that are intended to be permanently invested in those operations these undistributed earnings aggregated approximately 510842 and 400487 at october 31 2013 and 2012 respectively should these earnings be distributed applicable foreign tax credits would substantially offset united states taxes due upon the distribution 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes contractual obligations as of october 31 2013 

 

 1 we have a 500000 unsecured multicurrency credit facility with a group of banks that expires in december 2016 and may be increased to 750000 under certain conditions at october 31 2013 254000 was outstanding under this facility compared to 262450 outstanding at october 31 2012 the weighted average interest rate for borrowings under this agreement was 106 percent at october 31 2013 there are two primary financial covenants that must be met under this facility the first covenant limits the amount of total indebtedness that can be incurred to 35 times consolidated trailing fourquarter ebitda both indebtedness and ebitda as defined in the credit agreement the second covenant requires consolidated trailing fourquarter ebitda to be at least three times consolidated trailing fourquarter interest expense both as defined in the credit agreement at october 31 2013 we were in compliance with all debt covenants and the amount we could borrow under the credit facility would not have been limited by any debt covenants 

in 2011 we entered into a 150000 threeyear private shelf note agreement with new york life investment management llc borrowings under the agreement may be up to 12 years with an average life of up to 10 years and are unsecured the interest rate on each borrowing can be fixed or floating and is based upon the market rate at the borrowing date this agreement contains customary events of default and covenants related to limitations 

  

on indebtedness and the maintenance of certain financial ratios at october 31 2013 63889 was outstanding under this facility at a fixed rate of 221 percent per annum effective february 2013 the amount of the facility was increased from 150000 to 175000 we were in compliance with all covenants at october 31 2013 and the amount we could borrow would not have been limited by any debt covenants 

in 2012 we entered into a note purchase agreement with a group of insurance companies under which we sold 200000 of senior notes the notes mature between july 2017 and july 2025 and bear interest at fixed rates between 227 percent and 313 percent we were in compliance with all covenants at october 31 2013 

in 2013 we entered into a € 100000 agreement with the bank of tokyomitsubishi ufj ltd the term of the agreement is three years and can be extended by one year at the end of the third and fourth anniversaries the interest rate is variable based upon the eur libor rate at october 31 2013 there was € 95000 129058 outstanding under this agreement and the interest rate was 099 percent

2 see note 10 for additional information 

3 see note 8 for additional information 

4 pension and postretirement plan funding amounts after 2014 will be determined based on the future funded status of the plans and therefore cannot be estimated at this time see note 6 for additional information 

5 purchase obligations primarily represent commitments for materials used in our manufacturing processes that are not recorded in our consolidated balance sheet 

we believe that the combination of present capital resources internally generated funds and unused financing sources are more than adequate to meet cash requirements for 2014 there are no significant restrictions limiting the transfer of funds from international subsidiaries to the parent company 

outlook 

our operating performance balance sheet position and financial ratios for 2013 remained strong relative to 2012 and recent years although uncertainties persisted in global financial markets and the general economic environment going forward we are wellpositioned to manage our liquidity needs that arise from working capital requirements capital expenditures contributions related to pension and postretirement obligations and principal and interest payments on indebtedness primary sources of capital to meet these needs as well as other opportunistic investments are cash provided by operations and borrowings under our loan agreements in 2013 cash from operations was 17 percent of revenue with respect to borrowing under existing loan agreements as of october 31 2013 we had 246000 available capacity under our fiveyear term 500000 unsecured multicurrency credit facility in addition we had 111111 borrowing capacity remaining on our 175000 threeyear private shelf agreement with new york life investment management llc while these facilities provide the contractual terms for any borrowing we cannot be assured that these facilities would be available in the event that these financial institutions failed to remain sufficiently capitalized 

other loan agreements exist with no remaining borrowing capacity but factor into debt covenant calculations that affect future borrowing capacity on july 26 2012 we entered into a note purchase agreement with a group of insurance companies under which we sold 200000 of senior notes the notes mature between july 2017 and july 2025 and bear interest at fixed rates between 227 percent and 313 percent as of october 31 2013 we owe €95000 on a €100000 threeyear term loan facility entered into on august 30 2013 with the bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj ltd this loan facility bears interest at variable margin rates of 075 percent to 1625 percent above eur libor 

respective to all of these loans are two primary covenants the leverage ratio that restricts indebtedness net of cash to a maximum 35 times consolidated fourquarter trailing ebitda and the interest coverage ratio that requires fourquarter trailing ebitda to be at minimum three times consolidated trailing fourquarter interest expense debt ebitda and interest expense are as defined in respective credit agreements with respect to these two primary covenants as of october 31 2013 we were approximately 43 percent of the most restrictive leverage ratio 

  

and approximately nine times the most restrictive interest coverage ratio unused borrowing capacity under existing loan agreements would amount to an additional 24 percent of the most restrictive leverage ratio 

we move forward with caution regarding expectations for 2014 given persistent uncertainties related for example to the eurozone’s economic recovery us deficit reduction issues prospects for growth in emerging markets and expectations for global gdp improvement out of a lowgrowth macroeconomic environment though the pace of improvement in the global economy remains somewhat unclear our growth potential has been demonstrated over time from our capacity to build and enhance our core by entering emerging markets and pursuing market adjacencies we drive value for our customers through our application expertise differentiated technology and direct sales and service support our priorities also focus on operational improvements by employing continuous improvement methodologies to our business processes we expect these efforts will continue to provide more than sufficient cash from operations for meeting our liquidity needs and paying dividends to common shareholders as well as enabling us to invest in the development of new applications and markets for our technologies and pursue strategic acquisition opportunities for 2009 — 2013 excluding voluntary contributions to us defined benefit plans in 2010 cash from operations have been 17 to 21 percent of revenues resulting in more than sufficient cash for our ordinary business requirements our available borrowing capacity will enable us to make opportunistic investments in our own common shares and strategic business combinations 

with respect to contractual spending the table above presents our financial obligations as 836038 of which 110663 is payable in 2014 as of august 14 2013 we have in place a stock repurchase program approved by the board of directors and authorizing management at its discretion to repurchase shares up to 200000 as of october 31 2013 we have 196031 remaining under this authorization the repurchase program is funded using cash from operations and proceeds from borrowings under our credit facilities timing and actual number of shares subject to repurchase are contingent on a number of factors including levels of cash generation from operations cash requirements for acquisitions repayment of debt and our share price capital expenditures for 2014 will be focused primarily upon our continued efforts to leverage our information systems platform and invest in projects that improve both capacity and efficiency of manufacturing and distribution operations 

effects of foreign currency 

the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on sales and operating results cannot be precisely measured due to fluctuating selling prices sales volume product mix and cost structures in each country where we operate as a general rule a weakening of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies has a favorable effect on sales and net income while a strengthening of the dollar has a detrimental effect 

in 2013 as compared with 2012 the united states dollar was generally stronger against foreign currencies if 2012 exchange rates had been in effect during 2013 sales would have been approximately 5322 higher and thirdparty costs would have been approximately 1607 higher in 2012 as compared with 2011 the united states dollar was generally stronger against foreign currencies if 2011 exchange rates had been in effect during 2012 sales would have been approximately 26386 higher and thirdparty costs would have been approximately 16015 higher these effects on reported sales do not include the impact of local price adjustments made in response to changes in currency exchange rates 

inflation 

inflation affects profit margins as the ability to pass cost increases on to customers is restricted by the need for competitive pricing although inflation has been modest in recent years and has had no material effect on the years covered by these financial statements we continue to seek ways to minimize the impact of inflation through focused efforts to increase productivity 

  

trends 

the fiveyear summary in item 6 documents our historical financial trends over this period the world’s economic conditions fluctuated significantly our solid performance is attributed to our participation in diverse geographic and industrial markets and our longterm commitment to develop and provide quality products and worldwide service to meet our customers’ changing needs

 item 1a risk factors tableend in an enterprise as diverse as ours a wide range of factors could affect future performance we discuss in this section some of the risk factors that if they actually occurred could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition value and results of operations you should consider these risk factors in connection with evaluating the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k because these factors could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected in forwardlooking statements 

the significant risk factors affecting our operations include the following 

changes in united states or international economic conditions could adversely affect the profitability of any of our operations 

in 2012 28 percent of our revenue was derived from domestic customers while 72 percent was derived from international customers our largest markets include appliance automotive construction container electronics assembly food and beverage furniture life sciences and medical metal finishing nonwovens packaging paper and paperboard converting plastics processing and semiconductor a slowdown in any of these specific end markets could directly affect our revenue stream and profitability 

a portion of our product sales is attributable to industries and markets such as the semiconductor and metal finishing industries which historically have been cyclical and sensitive to relative changes in supply and demand and general economic conditions the demand for our products depends in part on the general economic conditions of the industries or national economies of our customers downward economic cycles in our customers’ industries or countries may reduce sales of some of our products it is not possible to predict accurately the factors that will affect demand for our products in the future 

any significant downturn in the health of the general economy either globally regionally or in the markets in which we sell products could have an adverse effect on our revenues and financial performance resulting in impairment of assets 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions and we may not be able to execute on our acquisition strategy or integrate acquisitions successfully 

our recent historical growth has depended and our future growth is likely to continue to depend in part on our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses into our existing operations we intend to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world we cannot assure however that we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition opportunities prevail against competing potential acquirers negotiate appropriate acquisition terms obtain financing that may be needed to consummate such acquisitions complete proposed acquisitions successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new markets in addition we cannot assure that any acquisition once successfully integrated will perform as planned be accretive to earnings or prove to be beneficial to our operations and cash flow 

the success of our acquisition strategy is subject to other risks and uncertainties including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

in addition an acquisition could adversely impact our operating performance as a result of the incurrence of acquisitionrelated debt acquisition expenses the amortization of acquisitionacquired assets or possible future impairments of goodwill or intangible assets associated with the acquisition 

we may also face liability with respect to acquired businesses for violations of environmental laws occurring prior to the date of our acquisition and some or all of these liabilities may not be covered by environmental insurance secured to mitigate the risk or by indemnification from the sellers from which we acquired these businesses we could also incur significant costs including but not limited to remediation costs natural resources damages civil or criminal fines and sanctions and thirdparty claims as a result of past or future violations of or liabilities associated with environmental laws 

failure to retain our existing senior management team or the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could hurt our business and inhibit our ability to operate and grow successfully 

our success will continue to depend to a significant extent on the continued service of our executive management team and the ability to recruit hire and retain other key management personnel to support our growth and operational initiatives and replace executives who retire or resign failure to retain our leadership team and attract and retain other important management and technical personnel could place a constraint on our global growth and operational initiatives possibly resulting in inefficient and ineffective management and operations which would likely harm our revenues operations and product development efforts and eventually result in a decrease in profitability 

if we fail to develop new products or our customers do not accept the new products we develop our revenue and profitability could be adversely impacted 

innovation is critical to our success we believe that we must continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and manufacture new products with improved capabilities in order to continue to be a leading provider of precision technology solutions for the industrial equipment market we also believe that we must continue to make improvements in our productivity in order to maintain our competitive position difficulties or delays in research development or production of new products or failure to gain market acceptance of new products and technologies may reduce future sales and adversely affect our competitive position we continue to invest in the development and marketing of new products there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses if we fail to make innovations launch products with quality problems or the market does not accept our new products our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected in addition as new or enhanced products are introduced we must successfully manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption in customers’ ordering patterns avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that we can deliver sufficient supplies of new products to meet customers’ demands 

if our intellectual property protection is inadequate others may be able to use our technologies and tradenames and thereby reduce our ability to compete which could have a material adverse effect on us our financial condition and results of operations 

we regard much of the technology underlying our products and the trademarks under which we market our products as proprietary the steps we take to protect our proprietary technology may be inadequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or third parties may independently develop similar technology we rely on a combination of patents trademark copyright and trade secret laws employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and other contracts to establish and protect our technology and other intellectual property rights the agreements may be breached or terminated and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach and existing trade secrets patent and copyright law afford us limited protection policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult a third party could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization litigation may be necessary for us to defend against claims of infringement or to protect our intellectual property rights and could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our efforts further we might not prevail in such litigation which could harm our business 

  

our products could infringe on the intellectual property of others which may cause us to engage in costly litigation and if we are not successful could cause us to pay substantial damages and prohibit us from selling our products 

third parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us based on their patents or other intellectual property claims and we may have to pay substantial damages possibly including treble damages if it is ultimately determined that our products infringe we may have to obtain a license to sell our products if it is determined that our products infringe upon another party’s intellectual property we might be prohibited from selling our products before we obtain a license which if available at all may require us to pay substantial royalties even if infringement claims against us are without merit defending these types of lawsuits takes significant time may be expensive and may divert management attention from other business concerns 

significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates or change in monetary policy may harm our financial results 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly with respect to the euro the yen the pound sterling and the chinese yuan any significant change in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business against the united states dollar could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for additional detail related to this risk see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

the majority of our consolidated revenues in 2012 were generated in currencies other than the united states dollar which is our reporting currency we recognize foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from our operations in the period incurred as a result currency fluctuations between the united states dollar and the currencies in which we do business have caused and will continue to cause foreign currency transaction and translation gains and losses which historically have been material and could continue to be material we cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future operating results because of the number of currencies involved the variability of currency exposures and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates we take actions to manage our foreign currency exposure such as entering into hedging transactions where available but we cannot assure that our strategies will adequately protect our consolidated operating results from the effects of exchange rate fluctuations 

we also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into united states dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or customers located in or conducting business in a country imposing controls currency devaluations diminish the united states dollar value of the currency of the country instituting the devaluation and if they occur or continue for significant periods could adversely affect our earnings or cash flow 

inability to access capital could impede growth or the repayment or refinancing of existing indebtedness 

the limits imposed on us by the restrictive covenants contained in our credit facilities could prevent us from making acquisitions or cause us to lose access to these facilities 

our existing credit facilities contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition our credit facilities require us to meet financial ratios including “total indebtedness” to “consolidated trailing earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization” ebitda both as defined in the credit facility and consolidated trailing ebitda to consolidated trailing interest expense as defined in the credit facility 

  

these restrictions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs and could otherwise restrict our financing activities 

our ability to comply with the covenants and other terms of our credit facilities will depend on our future operating performance if we fail to comply with such covenants and terms we will be in default and the maturity of the related debt could be accelerated and become immediately due and payable we may be required to obtain waivers from our lenders in order to maintain compliance under our credit facilities including waivers with respect to our compliance with certain financial covenants if we are unable to obtain necessary waivers and the debt under our credit facilities is accelerated we would be required to obtain replacement financing at prevailing market rates 

we may need new or additional financing in the future to expand our business or refinance existing indebtedness if we are unable to access capital on satisfactory terms and conditions we may not be able to expand our business or meet our payment requirements under our existing credit facilities our ability to obtain new or additional financing will depend on a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control we may not be able to obtain new or additional financing because we have substantial debt or because we may not have sufficient cash flow to service or repay our existing or future debt in addition depending on market conditions and our financial performance neither debt nor equity financing may be available on satisfactory terms or at all finally as a consequence of worsening financial market conditions our credit facility providers may not provide the agreed credit if they become undercapitalized 

political conditions in foreign countries in which we operate could adversely affect us 

we conduct our manufacturing sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and are subject to risks associated with doing business outside the united states in 2012 approximately 72 percent of our total sales were to customers outside the united states we expect that international operations and united states export sales will continue to be important to our business for the foreseeable future both sales from international operations and export sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside the united states such risks include but are not limited to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any of these events could reduce the demand for our products limit the prices at which we can sell our products or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operating performance 

  

in addition there is a potential risk of conflict and instability in the relationships between taiwan and china and china and japan conflict or instability could disrupt the operations of our customers andor suppliers in all three countries additionally our manufacturing operations in china and elsewhere could be impacted should disruptions caused by these conflicts substantially curtail our ability to source components used in the manufacture and assembly of our equipment 

our international operations also depend upon favorable trade relations between the us and those foreign countries in which our customers subcontractors and materials suppliers have operations a protectionist trade environment in either the us or those foreign countries in which we do business such as a change in the current tariff structures export compliance or other trade policies may materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our products in foreign markets 

although we have obtained property damage and business interruption insurance a major catastrophe such as an earthquake hurricane flood tsunami or other natural disaster at any of our sites or significant labor strikes work stoppages political unrest or any of the events described above some of which may not be covered by our insurance in any of the areas where we conduct operations could result in a prolonged interruption of our business any disruption resulting from these events could cause significant delays in the manufacture or shipment of products or the provision of repair and other services that may result in our loss of sales and customers our insurance will not cover all potential risks and we cannot assure you that we will have adequate insurance to compensate us for all losses that result from any insured risks any material loss not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows we cannot assure you that insurance will be available in the future at a cost acceptable to us or at a cost that will not have a material adverse effect on our profitability net income and cash flows 

we could be adversely affected by rapid changes in interest rates 

any period of unexpected or rapid increase in interest rates may also adversely affect our profitability at october 31 2012 we had 633710 of total debt and notes payable outstanding of which 49 percent was priced at interest rates that float with the market a one percent increase in the interest rate on the floating rate debt in 2012 would have resulted in approximately 2951 of additional interest expense a higher level of floating rate debt would increase the exposure to changes in interest rates for additional detail related to this risk see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

new regulations related to conflictfree minerals may force us to incur additional expenses and may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations 

pursuant to the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the sec promulgated final rules regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals known as conflict minerals which are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries as well as procedures regarding a manufacturer’s efforts to prevent the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from those minerals these new disclosure obligations will require due diligence efforts to support our initial disclosure requirements effective in may 2014 we will incur costs associated with complying with such disclosure requirements including costs associated with canvassing our supply chain to determine the source country of any conflict minerals incorporated in our products in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities in addition the implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend we are involved in pending or potential litigation regarding environmental product liability patent contract employee and other matters arising from the normal course of business including the environmental matter discussed below it is our opinion after consultation with legal counsel that resolutions of these matters are not expected to result in a material effect on our financial condition quarterly or annual operating results or cash flows 

environmental — we have voluntarily agreed with the city of new richmond wisconsin and other potentially responsible parties to share costs associated with the remediation of the city of new richmond municipal landfill the “site” and constructing a potable water delivery system serving the impacted area down gradient of the site at october 31 2012 and 2011 our accrual for the ongoing operation maintenance and monitoring obligation at the site was 750 and 795 respectively 

the liability for environmental remediation represents management’s best estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable undiscounted costs related to known remediation obligations the accuracy of our estimate of environmental liability is affected by several uncertainties such as additional requirements that may be identified in connection with remedial activities the complexity and evolution of environmental laws and regulations and the identification of presently unknown remediation requirements consequently our liability could be greater than our current estimate however we do not expect that the costs associated with remediation will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses on an ongoing basis we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that are used to prepare financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates used by management 

certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below on a regular basis critical accounting policies are reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 

revenue recognition  — most of our revenues are recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the sales price is fixed or determinable collectibility is reasonably assured and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer in october 2009 the fasb issued an accounting standard update on multiple deliverable arrangements which we adopted on november 1 2010 this accounting standard update establishes a relative selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available thirdparty evidence tpe if vendorspecific objective evidence is not available or best estimated selling price besp if neither vendorspecific objective evidence nor thirdparty evidence is available our multiple deliverable arrangements include installation installation supervision training and spare parts which tend to be completed in a short period of time at an insignificant cost and utilizing skills not unique to us and therefore are typically regarded as inconsequential or perfunctory revenue for undelivered items is deferred and included within accrued liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet revenues deferred in 2012 2011 and 2010 were not material the requirements of this standard did not significantly change our units of accounting or how we allocate arrangement consideration to various units of accounting the adoption of this standard had no material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

goodwill — goodwill is the excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in various business combinations goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level or more often if indications of impairment exist our reporting units are the adhesive dispensing systems segment the industrial coating systems segment and one level below the advanced technology systems segment 

we test goodwill in accordance with accounting standards codification asc 350 and other depreciable and amortizable longlived assets for recoverability in accordance with asc 360 the goodwill impairment test is a twostep process in the first step performed in the fourth quarter of each year we calculate a reporting unit’s fair value using a discounted cash flow valuation methodology and compare the result against the reporting unit’s carrying value of net assets if the carrying value of a reporting unit is close to or exceeds its fair value then a second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired we used independent valuation specialists to assist with refining our assumptions and methods used to determine fair values using discounted cash flow dcf methodology for our reporting units and other longlived assets and to prepare indications of value derived from a market approach using guideline companies and a reconciliation to results of the dcf approach in step one the assumptions used for discounted cash flow revenue growth operating margin and working capital turnover are based on general management’s strategic plans tempered by performance trends and reasonable expectations 

  

about those trends terminal value calculations employ a published formula known as the “gordon growth model method” that essentially captures the present value of perpetual cash flows beyond the last projected period assuming a constant weighted average cost of capital wacc methodology and growth rate for each reporting unit a sensitivity analysis is performed to vary the discount and terminal growth rates in order to provide a range of reasonableness that our expected assumptions are fair for detecting impairment 

discount rates are developed using a wacc methodology the wacc represents the blended average required rate of return for equity and debt capital based on observed market return data and company specific risk factors for 2012 the discount rates used ranged from 9 percent to 18 percent depending upon the reporting unit’s size end market volatility and projection risk the calculated internal rate of return for the step one consolidated valuation was 102 percent the same as the calculated wacc for total nordson 

to test the reasonableness of the discounted cash flow valuations we performed the control premium test which compares the sum of the fair values calculated for our reporting units net of debt to the market value of equity the control premium was 12 percent as of the test date of august 1 2012 and negative 2 percent as of our yearend of october 31 2012 these comparisons indicated that the discounted cash flow valuation was reasonable in addition indications of value derived for each reporting unit using the market approach reconciled reasonably with the results of the discounted cash flow approach 

in 2012 and 2011 the results of our step one testing indicated no impairment therefore the second step of impairment testing was not necessary 

the excess of fair value fv over carrying value cv was compared to the carrying value for each reporting unit based on the results shown in the table below and based on our measurement date of august 1 2012 our conclusion is that no indicators of impairment exist in 2012 potential events or circumstances such as a sustained downturn in global economies could have a negative effect on estimated fair values the table below includes sealant equipment  engineering inc 

 

 we acquired sealant equipment  engineering inc see on august 1 2012 determination of the preliminary fair value associated with this acquisition was completed with the assistance of an independent valuation specialist in october 2012 since the date of valuation no events or changes in circumstances have occurred that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of see below its carrying value for future valuation purposes see will be included in our industrial coating systems segment 

other longlived assets — our test for recoverability of longlived depreciable and amortizable assets uses undiscounted cash flows longlived assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows the total carrying value of longlived assets for each reporting unit has been compared to the forecasted cash flows of each reporting unit’s longlived assets being tested cash flows have been defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization less annual maintenance capital spending 

estimates of future cash flows used to test the recoverability of a longlived asset asset group are based on the remaining useful life of the asset we believe that the relative value of longlived assets within each reporting unit is a reasonable proxy for the relative importance of the assets in the production of cash flow to get to a reasonable forecast period the aggregate net book value of longlived assets was divided by the current depreciation and amortization value to arrive at a blended remaining useful life our calculations for 2012 showed the undiscounted aggregate value of cash flows over the remaining useful life for each reporting unit was greater than the respective carrying value of the longlived assets within each reporting unit so no impairment charges were recognized 

  

inventories — inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market cost was determined using the lastin firstout lifo method for 24 percent of consolidated inventories at october 31 2012 and 26 percent at october 31 2011 with the firstin firstout fifo method used for the remaining inventory on an ongoing basis inventory is tested for technical obsolescence as well as for future demand and changes in market conditions we have historically maintained inventory reserves to reflect those conditions when the cost of inventory is not expected to be recovered reserves are also maintained for inventory used for demonstration purposes the inventory reserve balance was 20505 16050 and 16802 at october 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

pension plans and postretirement medical plans — the measurement of liabilities related to our pension plans and postretirement medical plans is based on management’s assumptions related to future factors including interest rates return on pension plan assets compensation increases mortality and turnover assumptions and health care cost trend rates 

the weightedaverage discount rate used to determine the present value of our domestic pension plan obligations was 385 percent at october 31 2012 and 446 percent at october 31 2011 the weightedaverage discount rate used to determine the present value of our various international pension plan obligations was 352 percent at october 31 2012 compared to 443 percent at october 31 2011 the discount rates used for all plans were determined by using quality fixed income investments with a duration period approximately equal to the period over which pension obligations are expected to be settled 

in determining the expected return on plan assets we consider both historical performance and an estimate of future longterm rates of return on assets similar to those in our plans we consult with and consider the opinions of financial and actuarial experts in developing appropriate return assumptions the expected rate of return longterm investment rate on domestic pension assets used to determine net benefit costs was 775 percent in 2012 and 825 percent in 2011 the average expected rate of return on international pension assets used to determine net benefit costs was 485 percent in 2012 and 484 percent in 2011 

the assumed rate of compensation increases used to determine the present value of our domestic pension plan obligations was 312 percent at october 31 2012 and 320 percent at october 31 2011 the assumed rate of compensation increases used to determine the present value of our international pension plan obligations was 313 percent at october 31 2012 compared to 316 percent at october 31 2011 

annual expense amounts are determined based on the discount rate used at the end of the prior year differences between actual and assumed investment returns on pension plan assets result in actuarial gains or losses that are amortized into expense over a period of years 

economic assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported the effect of a one percent change in the discount rate expected return on assets and compensation increase is shown in the table below bracketed numbers represent decreases in expense and obligation amounts 

 

 with respect to the domestic postretirement medical plan the discount rate used to value the benefit obligation decreased from 450 percent at october 31 2011 to 385 percent at october 31 2012 the annual rate of 

  

increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the health care cost trend rate is assumed to be 490 percent in 2013 decreasing gradually to 360 percent in 2017 the health care cost trend rate reflects a change in the plan design of the retiree medical plan effective january 1 2013 moving to a health reimbursement arrangement for post65 coverage 

for the international postretirement plan the discount rate used to value the benefit obligation was 440 percent at october 31 2012 and 585 percent at october 31 2011 the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the health care cost trend rate is assumed to be 700 percent in 2013 decreasing gradually to 350 percent in 2031 

the discount rate and the health care cost trend rate assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported for example a onepercentage point change in the discount rate and assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects 

 

 employees hired after january 1 2002 are not eligible to participate in the domestic postretirement medical plan 

pension and postretirement expenses in 2013 are expected to be approximately 5200 higher than 2012 primarily due to changes in discount rates and expected rates of return on assets 

financial instruments — assets liabilities and commitments that are to be settled in cash and are denominated in foreign currencies are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates we enter into foreign currency forward contracts which are derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of foreign currency exposures resulting from the collection of receivables payables and loans denominated in foreign currencies the maturities of these contracts are usually less than 90 days forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and therefore are marked to market each accounting period and the resulting gains or losses are included in “other–net” within other income expense in the consolidated statement of income 

warranties — we provide customers with a product warranty that requires us to repair or replace defective products within a specified period of time generally one year from the date of delivery or first use an accrual is recorded for expected warranty costs for products shipped through the end of each accounting period in determining the amount of the accrual we rely primarily on historical warranty claims amounts charged to the warranty reserve were 5430 7417 and 6068 in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the reserve balance was 8929 6723 and 5242 at october 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

longterm incentive plan ltip — under the longterm incentive plan executive officers and selected other key employees receive share awards based on corporate performance measures over threeyear performance periods awards vary based on the degree to which corporate performance equals or exceeds predetermined threshold target and maximum performance levels at the end of a performance period no award will occur unless certain threshold performance objectives are equaled or exceeded the amount of compensation expense is based upon current performance projections for each threeyear period and the percentage of the requisite service that has been rendered the calculations are also based upon the grant date fair value determined using the closing market price of common stock at the grant date reduced by the implied value of dividends not to be paid awards are recorded as capital in excess of stated value in shareholders’ equity the amount recorded at october 31 2012 for the plans originating in 2010 2011 and 2012 was 8707

related to our united states adhesive dispensing systems plant consolidation initiative the costs associated with the transfer of production and startup activities were classified as “cost of goods sold — restructuring” in the consolidated statement of income other decreases in gross margin in 2012 were due primarily to the dilutive effect of acquired product lines and currency effects 

selling and administrative expenses excluding severance and restructuring costs were 485285 in 2012 an increase of 55796 or 130 percent from 2011 the increase was largely due to the addition of acquired businesses acquisition transaction costs and higher compensation expenses related to increased employment levels partially offset by currency effects that reduced expenses selling and administrative expenses for 2011 included 3120 related to a fee paid to withdraw from a multiemployer employee pension fund in japan 

selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to 344 percent in 2012 from 348 percent in 2011 due to the higher level of sales and the favorable effects of restructuring activities

recently issued accounting standards — in december 2010 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance that provides requirements for pro forma revenue and earnings disclosures related to business combinations this guidance requires disclosure of revenue and earnings of the combined business as if the combination occurred at the start of the prior annual reporting period only we adopted this standard on november 1 2011 and required disclosures are included in note 13 

in may 2011 the fasb clarified the guidance concerning fair value measurements and disclosures the guidance requires the disclosure of quantitative information about unobservable inputs used a description of the valuation processes used and a qualitative discussion around the sensitivity of the measurements we adopted this guidance on february 1 2012 and there was no material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in june 2011 the fasb issued an accounting standards update asu that amends current comprehensive income guidance this asu eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of shareholders’ equity instead comprehensive income must be reported in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income which contains two sections net income and other comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements we adopted this guidance in 2012 and it did not impact our consolidated financial statements as it only resulted in a change in the format of presentation 

in september 2011 the fasb issued guidance amending the way companies test for goodwill impairment companies will have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine the existence of events or circumstances that lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances companies determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount then performing the twostep impairment test is unnecessary this guidance is effective for us beginning in 2013 with early adoption permitted adoption of this guidance could change our annual process for goodwill impairment testing but will not impact the financial statements

we believe that the combination of present capital resources internally generated funds and unused financing sources are more than adequate to meet cash requirements for 2013 there are no significant restrictions limiting the transfer of funds from international subsidiaries to the parent company 

outlook 

our operating performance balance sheet position and financial ratios for 2012 remained strong relative to 2011 and recent years while uncertainties persisted in global financial markets and the general economic environment going forward we are wellpositioned to manage our liquidity needs that arise from working capital requirements capital expenditures contributions related to pension and postretirement obligations and principal and interest payments on indebtedness primary sources of capital to meet these needs as well as other opportunistic investments are cash provided by operations and borrowings under our loan agreements in 2012 cash from operations was 20 percent of revenue with respect to borrowing under existing loan agreements as of october 31 2012 we had 237550 available capacity under our fiveyear term 500000 unsecured multicurrency credit facility in addition we had 75000 borrowing capacity remaining on our 150000 threeyear private shelf agreement with new york life investment management llc while these facilities provide the contractual terms for any borrowing we cannot be assured that these facilities would be available in the event that these financial institutions failed to remain sufficiently capitalized 

other loan agreements exist with no remaining borrowing capacity but factor into debt covenant calculations that affect future borrowing capacity as of october 31 2012 we have a balance of 50000 due on our 250000 credit agreement with pnc bank no additional amount can be reborrowed under this agreement on july 26 2012 we entered into a note purchase agreement with a group of insurance companies under which we sold 200000 of senior notes the notes mature between july 2017 and july 2025 and bear interest at fixed rates between 227 percent and 313 percent and since 2008 we have had a 50000 senior note with prudential investment management inc that will mature in 2013 

respective to all of these loans are two primary covenants the leverage ratio that restricts indebtedness net of cash to a maximum 35 times consolidated fourquarter trailing ebitda and the interest coverage ratio that requires fourquarter trailing ebitda to be at minimum three times fourquarter trailing interest expense debt ebitda and interest expense are as defined in respective credit agreements with respect to these two primary covenants as of october 31 2012 we were approximately 41 percent of the most restrictive leverage ratio and approximately seven times the most restrictive interest coverage ratio unused borrowing capacity under existing loan agreements would amount to an additional 22 percent of the most restrictive leverage ratio for fourquarter trailing ebitda as of october 31 2012 

we move forward with caution in our approach to 2013 given persistent uncertainties related primarily to european sovereign debt issues us deficit reduction issues and prospects for slowing growth in asian markets though the nearterm global macroeconomic outlook remains somewhat unclear our growth potential has been demonstrated over time from our capacity to build and enhance our core by entering emerging markets and pursuing market adjacencies we drive value for our customers through our application expertise differentiated technology and direct sales and service support our priorities also are focused on continued operational 

  

improvements by employing continuous improvement methodologies to our business processes we expect these efforts will continue to provide more than sufficient cash from operations for meeting our liquidity needs and paying dividends to common shareholders as well as enabling us to invest in the development of new applications and markets for our technologies and pursue strategic acquisition opportunities for fiscal years 2009 — 2012 excluding voluntary contributions to us defined benefit plans in 2010 cash from operations have been 19 to 21 percent of revenues resulting in more than sufficient cash for our ordinary business requirements our available borrowing capacity primarily will enable us to make opportunistic investments in our own common shares and strategic business combinations 

with respect to contractual spending the table above presents our financial obligations as 832797 of which 207749 is payable in 2013 as of march 1 2012 we have in place a stock repurchase program approved by the board of directors and authorizing management at its discretion to repurchase shares up to 100000 as of october 31 2012 we have 84883 remaining under this authorization the repurchase program is being funded using cash from operations and proceeds from borrowings under our credit facilities timing and actual number of shares subject to repurchase are contingent on a number of factors including levels of cash generation from operations cash requirements for acquisitions repayment of debt and our share price capital expenditures for 2013 will be focused primarily upon our continued efforts to leverage our information systems platform and invest in projects that improve manufacturing and distribution operations 

effects of foreign currency 

the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on sales and operating results cannot be precisely measured due to fluctuating selling prices sales volume product mix and cost structures in each country where we operate as a general rule a weakening of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies has a favorable effect on sales and net income while a strengthening of the dollar has a detrimental effect 

in 2012 as compared with 2011 the united states dollar was generally stronger against foreign currencies if 2011 exchange rates had been in effect during 2012 sales would have been approximately 26386 higher and thirdparty costs would have been approximately 16015 higher in 2011 as compared with 2010 the united states dollar was generally weaker against foreign currencies if 2010 exchange rates had been in effect during 2011 sales would have been approximately 33499 lower and thirdparty costs would have been approximately 17872 lower these effects on reported sales do not include the impact of local price adjustments made in response to changes in currency exchange rates 

inflation 

inflation affects profit margins as the ability to pass cost increases on to customers is restricted by the need for competitive pricing although inflation has been modest in recent years and has had no material effect on the years covered by these financial statements we continue to seek ways to minimize the impact of inflation through focused efforts to increase productivity 

trends 

the fiveyear summary in item 6 documents our historical financial trends over this period the world’s economic conditions fluctuated significantly our solid performance is attributed to our participation in diverse geographic and industrial markets and our longterm commitment to develop and provide quality products and worldwide service to meet our customers’ changing needs

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we operate internationally and enter into intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies consequently we are subject to market risk arising from exchange rate movements between the dates foreign currencies are recorded and the dates they are settled we regularly use foreign exchange contracts to reduce our risks related to most of these transactions these contracts primarily associated with the euro yen and pound sterling typically have maturities of 90 days or less and generally require the exchange of foreign currencies for united states dollars at rates stated in the contracts gains and losses from changes in the market value of these contracts offset foreign exchange losses and gains respectively on the underlying transactions other transactions denominated in foreign currencies are designated as hedges of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries or are intercompany transactions of a longterm investment nature as a result of the use of foreign exchange contracts on a routine basis to reduce the risks related to most of our transactions denominated in foreign currencies as of october 31 2012 we did not have material foreign currency exposure

senior operating executives supervise an extensive quality control program for our equipment machinery and systems 

natural gas and other fuels are our primary energy sources however standby capacity for alternative sources is available if needed 




 item 1a risk factors tableend in an enterprise as diverse as ours a wide range of factors could affect future performance we discuss in this section some of the risk factors that if they actually occurred could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition value and results of operations you should consider these risk factors in connection with evaluating the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k because these factors could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected in forwardlooking statements 

the significant risk factors affecting our operations include the following 

changes in united states or international economic conditions could adversely affect the profitability of any of our operations 

in 2011 25 percent of our revenue was derived from domestic customers while 75 percent was derived from international customers our largest markets include appliance automotive construction container electronics assembly food and beverage furniture life sciences and medical light emitting diodes led metal finishing nonwovens packaging paper and paperboard converting and semiconductor a slowdown in any of these specific end markets could directly affect our revenue stream and profitability 

a portion of our product sales is attributable to industries and markets such as the semiconductor and metal finishing industries which historically have been cyclical and sensitive to relative changes in supply and demand and general economic conditions the demand for our products depends in part on the general economic conditions of the industries or national economies of our customers downward economic cycles in our customers’ industries or countries may reduce sales of some of our products it is not possible to predict accurately the factors that will affect demand for our products in the future 

any significant downturn in the health of the general economy either globally regionally or in the markets in which we sell products could have an adverse effect on our revenues and financial performance resulting in impairment of assets 

significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates or change in monetary policy may harm our financial results 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly with respect to the euro the yen the pound sterling and the chinese yuan any significant change in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business against the united states dollar could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for additional detail related to this risk see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

the majority of our consolidated revenues in 2011 were generated in currencies other than the united states dollar which is our reporting currency we recognize foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from our operations in the period incurred as a result currency fluctuations between the united states dollar and the currencies in which we do business have caused and will continue to cause foreign currency transaction and translation gains and losses which historically have been material and could continue to be material we cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future operating results because of the number of currencies involved the variability of currency exposures and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates we take actions to manage our foreign currency exposure such as entering into hedging transactions where available but we cannot assure that our strategies will adequately protect our consolidated operating results from the effects of exchange rate fluctuations 

we also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into united states dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or customers located in or conducting business in a country imposing controls currency devaluations diminish the united states dollar value of the currency of the country instituting the devaluation and if they occur or continue for significant periods could adversely affect our earnings or cash flow 

  

failure to retain our existing senior management team or the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could hurt our business and inhibit our ability to operate and grow successfully 

our success will continue to depend to a significant extent on the continued service of our executive management team and the ability to recruit hire and retain other key management personnel to support our growth and operational initiatives and replace executives who retire or resign failure to retain our leadership team and attract and retain other important management and technical personnel could place a constraint on our global growth and operational initiatives which could lead to inefficient and ineffective management and operations which would likely harm our revenues operations and product development efforts and eventually result in a decrease in profitability 

the inability to continue to develop new products could limit our revenue and profitability 

innovation is critical to our success we believe that we must continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and manufacture new products with improved capabilities in order to continue to be a market leader we also believe that we must continue to make improvements in our productivity in order to maintain our competitive position our inability to anticipate respond to or utilize changing technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated results of operations 

inability to access capital could impede growth or the repayment or refinancing of existing indebtedness 

the limits imposed on us by the restrictive covenants contained in our credit facilities could prevent us from making acquisitions or cause us to lose access to these facilities 

our existing credit facilities contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition our credit facilities require us to meet financial ratios including “total indebtedness” to “consolidated trailing earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization” ebitda both as defined in the credit facility and consolidated trailing ebitda to consolidated trailing interest expense as defined in the credit facility 

these restrictions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs and could otherwise restrict our financing activities 

our ability to comply with the covenants and other terms of our credit facilities will depend on our future operating performance if we fail to comply with such covenants and terms we will be in default and the maturity of the related debt could be accelerated and become immediately due and payable we may be required to obtain waivers from our lenders in order to maintain compliance under our credit facilities including waivers with respect to our compliance with certain financial covenants if we are unable to obtain necessary waivers and the debt under our credit facilities is accelerated we would be required to obtain replacement financing at prevailing market rates 

we may need new or additional financing in the future to expand our business or refinance existing indebtedness if we are unable to access capital on satisfactory terms and conditions we may not be able to expand our business or meet our payment requirements under our existing credit facilities our ability to obtain new or additional financing will depend on a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control we may not be able to obtain new or additional financing because we have substantial debt or because we may not have sufficient cash flow to service or repay our existing or future debt in addition depending on market conditions and our financial performance neither debt nor equity financing may be available on satisfactory terms or at all finally as a consequence of worsening financial market conditions our credit facility providers may not provide the agreed credit if they become undercapitalized 

  

our growth strategy includes acquisitions and we may not be able to execute on our acquisition strategy or integrate acquisitions successfully 

our recent historical growth has depended and our future growth is likely to continue to depend in part on our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses into our existing operations we intend to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world we cannot assure however that we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition opportunities prevail against competing potential acquirers negotiate appropriate acquisition terms obtain financing that may be needed to consummate such acquisitions complete proposed acquisitions successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new markets in addition we cannot assure that any acquisition once successfully integrated will perform as planned be accretive to earnings or prove to be beneficial to our operations and cash flow 

the success of our acquisition strategy is subject to other risks and uncertainties including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition an acquisition could adversely impact our operating performance as a result of the incurrence of acquisitionrelated debt acquisition expenses the amortization of acquisitionacquired assets or possible future impairments of goodwill or intangible assets associated with the acquisition 

we may also face liability with respect to acquired businesses for violations of environmental laws occurring prior to the date of our acquisition and some or all of these liabilities may not be covered by environmental insurance secured to mitigate the risk or by indemnification from the sellers from which we acquired these businesses we could also incur significant costs including but not limited to remediation costs natural resources damages civil or criminal fines and sanctions and thirdparty claims as a result of past or future violations of or liabilities associated with environmental laws 

our inability to protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect product sales and financial performance 

difficulties in acquiring and maintaining our intellectual property rights could also adversely affect our business and financial position our performance may depend in part on our ability to establish protect and enforce intellectual property rights with respect to our patented technologies and proprietary rights and to defend against any claims of infringement these activities involve complex and constantly evolving legal scientific and factual questions and uncertainties our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends in part on our ability to maintain and enforce our patents and other proprietary rights which are essential to our business these measures afford only limited protection and may not in all cases prevent our competitors from gaining access to our intellectual property and proprietary information 

  

litigation has been and may continue to be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets and to determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights in addition we may face claims of infringement that could interfere with our ability to use technology or other intellectual property rights that are material to our business operations if litigation that we initiate is unsuccessful we may not be able to protect the value of some of our intellectual property if a claim of infringement against us is successful we may be required to pay royalties or license fees to continue to use technology or other intellectual property rights that we have been using or we may be unable to obtain necessary licenses from third parties at a reasonable cost or within a reasonable time if we are unable to timely obtain licenses on reasonable terms we may be forced to cease selling or using any of our products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property or to redesign or in the case of trademark claims rename our products to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties this may not always be possible or if possible may be time consuming and expensive intellectual property litigation whether successful or unsuccessful could be expensive to us and divert some of our resources our intellectual property rights may not be as valuable as we believe which could result in a competitive disadvantage or adversely affect our business and financial performance 

political conditions in foreign countries in which we operate could adversely affect us 

we conduct our manufacturing sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and are subject to risks associated with doing business outside the united states in 2011 approximately 75 percent of our total sales were to customers outside the united states we expect that international operations and united states export sales will continue to be important to our business for the foreseeable future both sales from international operations and export sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside the united states such risks include but are not limited to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any of these events could reduce the demand for our products limit the prices at which we can sell our products or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operating performance 

we could be adversely affected by rapid changes in interest rates 

any period of unexpected or rapid increase in interest rates may also adversely affect our profitability at october 31 2011 we had 319156 of total debt and notes payable outstanding of which 60 percent was priced at interest rates that float with the market a one percent increase in the interest rate on the floating rate debt in 2011 would have resulted in approximately 785 of additional interest expense a higher level of floating rate debt would increase the exposure to changes in interest rates for additional detail related to this risk see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend we are involved in pending or potential litigation regarding environmental product liability patent contract employee and other matters arising from the normal course of business including the environmental matter discussed below it is our opinion after consultation with legal counsel that resolutions of these matters are not expected to result in a material effect on our financial condition quarterly or annual operating results or cash flows 

environmental — we have voluntarily agreed with the city of new richmond wisconsin and other potentially responsible parties to share costs associated with the remediation of the city of new richmond municipal landfill the “site” and constructing a potable water delivery system serving the impacted area down gradient of the site at october 31 2011 and 2010 our accrual for the ongoing operation maintenance and monitoring obligation at the site was 795 and 885 respectively 

the liability for environmental remediation represents management’s best estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable undiscounted costs related to known remediation obligations the accuracy of our estimate of environmental liability is affected by several uncertainties such as additional requirements that may be identified in connection with remedial activities the complexity and evolution of environmental laws and regulations and the identification of presently unknown remediation requirements consequently our liability could be greater than our current estimate however we do not expect that the costs associated with remediation will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses on an ongoing basis we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that are used to prepare financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates used by management 

certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below on a regular basis critical accounting policies are reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 

revenue recognition — most of our revenues are recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the sales price is fixed or determinable collectibility is reasonably assured and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer in october 2009 the fasb issued an accounting standard update on multiple deliverable arrangements which we adopted on november 1 2010 this accounting standard update establishes a relative selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available thirdparty evidence tpe if vendorspecific objective evidence is not available or best estimated selling price besp if neither vendorspecific objective evidence nor thirdparty evidence is available our multiple deliverable arrangements include installation installation supervision training and spare parts which tend to be completed in a short period of time at an insignificant cost and utilizing skills not unique to us and therefore are typically regarded as inconsequential or perfunctory revenue for undelivered items is deferred and included within accrued liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet revenues deferred in 2011 2010 and 2009 were not material the requirements of this standard did not significantly change our units of accounting or how we allocate arrangement consideration to various units of accounting the adoption of this standard had no material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

goodwill — goodwill is the excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in various business combinations goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level or more often if indications of impairment exist our reporting units are the adhesive dispensing systems segment the industrial coating systems segment and one level below the advanced technology systems segment 

the goodwill impairment test is a twostep process in the first step performed in the fourth quarter of each year we calculate a reporting unit’s fair value using a discounted cash flow valuation methodology and compare the result against the reporting unit’s carrying value of net assets if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value then a second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired in step one the assumptions used for discounted cash flow revenue growth operating margin and working capital turnover are based on general management’s strategic plans tempered by performance trends and reasonable expectations about those trends terminal value calculations employ a published formula known as the “gordon growth model method” that essentially captures the present value of perpetual cash flows beyond the last projected period assuming a constant weighted average cost of capital methodology wacc and growth rate for each reporting unit sensitivity calculations vary the discount and terminal growth rates in order to provide a range of assurance that our expected assumptions are fair for detecting impairment 

  

discount rates were developed using a wacc methodology the wacc represents the blended average required rate of return for equity and debt capital based on observed market return data and company specific risk factors for 2011 the discount rates used ranged from 10 percent to 19 percent depending upon the reporting unit’s size end market volatility and projection risk the calculated internal rate of return for the step one consolidated valuation was 113 percent the same as the calculated wacc for total nordson 

to test the reasonableness of the discounted cash flow valuations we performed the control premium test which compares the sum of the fair values calculated for our reporting units net of debt to the market value of equity the control premium was negative 11 percent as of the test date of august 1 2011 and 0 percent as of our yearend of october 31 2011 these comparisons indicated that the discounted cash flow valuation was reasonable in addition indications of value derived for each reporting unit using the market approach reconciled reasonably with the results of the discounted cash flow approach 

in 2011 and 2010 the results of our step one testing indicated no impairment therefore the second step of impairment testing was not necessary 

in 2009 we determined that the second step of impairment testing was necessary in the second step a hypothetical purchase price allocation of the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities is performed using the fair value calculated in step one the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the hypothetical fair value of assets and liabilities is the implied goodwill amount impairment is recorded if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is higher than its implied goodwill based upon the results of our impairment testing we recognized an impairment charge for a reduction in the carrying value of goodwill in the amount of 232789 relating to six reporting units as follows dage 166916 picodostec 7530 yestech 26149 march plasma systems 16449 uv curing 12129 and industrial coating systems 3616 

the excess of fair value fv over carrying value cv was compared to the carrying value for each reporting unit based on the results shown in the table below and based on our measurement date of august 1 2011 our conclusion is that no indicators of impairment exist in 2011 potential events or circumstances such as a sustained downturn in global economies could have a negative effect on estimated fair values 

 

 we acquired value plastics inc “value plastics” on august 26 2011 subsequent to the measurement date for impairment testing determination of the preliminary fair value associated with this acquisition was completed with the assistance of an independent valuation specialist on october 5 2011 since the date of valuation no events or changes in circumstances have occurred that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of value plastics below its carrying value for future valuation purposes value plastics will be a component of efd 

other longlived assets — our test for recoverability of longlived depreciable and amortizable assets uses undiscounted cash flows longlived assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows the total carrying value of longlived assets for each reporting unit has been compared to the forecasted cash flows of each reporting unit’s longlived assets being tested cash flows have been defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization less annual maintenance capital spending 

estimates of future cash flows used to test the recoverability of a longlived asset asset group are based on the remaining useful life of the asset we believe that the relative value of longlived assets within each reporting unit is a reasonable proxy for the relative importance of the assets in the production of cash flow to get to a reasonable forecast period the aggregate net book value of longlived assets was divided by the current depreciation and amortization value to arrive at a blended remaining useful life our calculations for 2011 showed the undiscounted aggregate value of cash flows over the remaining useful life for each reporting unit was greater than the respective carrying value of the longlived assets within each reporting unit so no impairment charges were recognized 

  

inventories — inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market cost was determined using the lastin firstout lifo method for 26 percent of consolidated inventories at october 31 2011 and 25 percent at october 31 2010 with the firstin firstout fifo method used for the remaining inventory on an ongoing basis inventory is tested for technical obsolescence as well as for future demand and changes in market conditions we have historically maintained inventory reserves to reflect those conditions when the cost of inventory is not expected to be recovered reserves are also maintained for inventory used for demonstration purposes the inventory reserve balance was 16050 16802 and 15740 at october 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

pension plans and postretirement medical plans — the measurement of liabilities related to our pension plans and postretirement medical plans is based on management’s assumptions related to future factors including interest rates return on pension plan assets compensation increases mortality and turnover assumptions and health care cost trend rates 

the weightedaverage discount rate used to determine the present value of our domestic pension plan obligations was 446 percent at october 31 2011 and 521 percent at october 31 2010 the discount rate for these plans which comprised 79 percent of the worldwide pension obligations at october 31 2011 was based on quality fixed income investments with a duration period approximately equal to the period over which pension obligations are expected to be settled the weightedaverage discount rate used to determine the present value of our various international pension plan obligations was 443 percent at october 31 2011 compared to 417 percent at october 31 2010 the discount rates used for the international plans were determined by using quality fixed income investments with a duration period approximately equal to the period over which pension obligations are expected to be settled 

in determining the expected return on plan assets we consider both historical performance and an estimate of future longterm rates of return on assets similar to those in our plans we consult with and consider the opinions of financial and actuarial experts in developing appropriate return assumptions the expected rate of return longterm investment rate on domestic pension assets used to determine net benefit costs was 825 percent in 2011 and 851 percent in 2010 the average expected rate of return on international pension assets used to determine net benefit costs was 484 percent in 2011 and 485 percent in 2010 

the assumed rate of compensation increases used to determine the present value of our domestic pension plan obligations was 320 percent at october 31 2011 and 330 percent at october 31 2010 the assumed rate of compensation increases used to determine the present value of our international pension plan obligations was 316 percent at october 31 2011 compared to 321 percent at october 31 2010 

annual expense amounts are determined based on the discount rate used at the end of the prior year differences between actual and assumed investment returns on pension plan assets result in actuarial gains or losses that are amortized into expense over a period of years 

economic assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported the effect of a one percent change in the discount rate expected return on assets and compensation increase is shown in the table below bracketed numbers represent decreases in expense and obligation amounts 

 

   

with respect to the domestic postretirement medical plan the discount rate used to value the benefit obligation decreased from 525 percent at october 31 2010 to 450 percent at october 31 2011 the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the health care cost trend rate is assumed to be 936 percent in 2012 decreasing gradually to 500 percent in 2016 

for the international postretirement plan the discount rate used to value the benefit obligation was 585 percent at october 31 2011 and 575 percent at october 31 2010 the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the health care cost trend rate is assumed to be 700 percent in 2012 decreasing gradually to 350 percent in 2031 

the discount rate and the health care cost trend rate assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported for example a onepercentage point change in the discount rate and assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects 

 

 employees hired after january 1 2002 are not eligible to participate in the domestic postretirement medical plan 

pension and postretirement expenses in 2012 are expected to be approximately 7000 higher than 2011 primarily due to changes in the discount rate expected rate of return on assets and changes in demographic assumptions 

financial instruments — assets liabilities and commitments that are to be settled in cash and are denominated in foreign currencies are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates we enter into foreign currency forward contracts which are derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of foreign currency exposures resulting from the collection of receivables payables and loans denominated in foreign currencies the maturities of these contracts are usually less than 90 days forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and therefore are marked to market each accounting period and the resulting gains or losses are included in “othernet” within other income expense in the consolidated statement of income 

warranties — we provide customers with a product warranty that requires us to repair or replace defective products within a specified period of time generally one year from the date of delivery or first use an accrual is recorded for expected warranty costs for products shipped through the end of each accounting period in determining the amount of the accrual we rely primarily on historical warranty claims amounts charged to the warranty reserve were 7217 6068 and 3824 in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the reserve balance was 6528 5242 and 4587 at october 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

longterm incentive plan ltip — under the longterm incentive plan executive officers and selected other key employees receive share awards based solely on corporate performance measures over threeyear performance periods awards vary based on the degree to which corporate performance equals or exceeds predetermined threshold target and maximum performance levels at the end of a performance period no award will occur unless certain threshold performance objectives are equaled or exceeded the amount of compensation expense is based upon current performance projections for each threeyear period and the percentage of the requisite service that has been rendered the calculations are also based upon the grant date fair value determined using the closing market price of common stock at the grant date reduced by the implied value of dividends not to be paid awards are recorded as capital in excess of stated value in shareholders’ equity the amount recorded at october 31 2011 for the plans originating in 2009 2010 and 2011 was 6081 

  

compensation expense attributable to all ltip performance periods for executive officers and selected other key employees for 2011 and 2010 was 4067 and 3879 respectively there was 5014 credited to expense in 2009 due to economic effects 

2011 and 2010 

sales — worldwide sales for 2011 were 1233159 an increase of 184 percent from 2010 sales of 1041551 sales volume increased 152 percent and favorable currency effects caused by the weaker us dollar increased sales by 32 percent three acquisitions were made during 2011 micromedics inc “micromedics” and value plastics which were included within the advanced technology systems segment and constructiewerkhuizen g verbruggen nv “verbruggen” which was included within the adhesive systems segment the effect on sales volume of these acquisitions less sales associated with uv graphic arts and lamps product lines divested in 2010 was less than one percent 

as used throughout this form 10k geographic regions include the americas canada mexico and central and south america asia pacific excluding japan europe japan and the united states 

sales of the adhesive dispensing systems segment were 611911 in 2011 an increase of 86621 or 165 percent from 2010 sales of 525290 the increase was the result of a sales volume increase of 121 percent and favorable currency effects that increased sales by 44 percent the sales volume increase generated by the verbruggen acquisition was less than one percent sales volume increased in all geographic regions and was particularly strong in the americas region sales increased in both consumer nondurable and consumer durable end markets 

sales of the advanced technology systems segment were 438634 in 2011 an increase of 69185 or 187 percent from 2010 sales of 369449 the increase was the result of a sales volume increase of 170 percent and favorable currency effects that increased sales by 17 percent within the segment volume increases occurred in all geographic regions and were most pronounced in the united states the sales volume increase generated by the micromedics and value plastics acquisitions was three percent however this was offset by two percent resulting from the uv graphic arts and lamps product lines divested in 2010 higher demand for consumer electronics drove the sales increase within this segment 

in 2011 sales of the industrial coating systems segment were 182614 an increase of 35802 or 244 percent from 2010 sales of 146812 the increase was the result of a sales volume increase of 214 percent and favorable currency effects that increased sales by 30 percent sales volume increased in all geographic regions and was most pronounced in the asia pacific and americas regions within this segment sales increased across all product lines 

sales outside the united states accounted for 747 percent of our sales in 2011 up from 737 percent last year sales increased in all five geographic regions in which we operate in the united states sales were 312328 in 2011 an increase of 141 percent from 2010 in the americas sales were 102077 up 308 percent from 2010 sales volume increased 270 percent and favorable currency effects increased sales by 38 percent in europe sales were 390319 in 2011 an increase of 161 percent from 2010 sales volume increased 120 percent and favorable currency effects increased sales by 41 percent in japan sales were 111003 up 190 percent from 2010 sales volume increased 92 percent and favorable currency effects added 98 percent in asia pacific sales were 317432 in 2011 an increase of 219 percent from 2010 sales volume increased 190 percent and favorable currency effects added 29 percent 

it is estimated that the effect of pricing on total revenue was neutral relative to 2010 

operating profit — cost of sales in 2011 were 484727 up 154 percent from 2010 the increase compared to 2010 is due to increased sales volume gross margins expressed as a percentage of sales increased to 607 percent in 2011 from 597 percent in 2010 the gross margin percentage increase in 2011 was due to higher absorption of fixed overhead costs lowcost sourcing more profitable product line mix and favorable currency effects 

selling and administrative expenses excluding severance and restructuring costs were 429489 in 2011 an increase of 44737 or 116 percent from 2010 the increase was largely due to the effects of acquisitions a 

  

3120 fee paid to withdraw from a multiemployer employee pension fund in japan and higher incentive compensation expenses resulting from a higher level of business activity in 2011 in addition currency translation effects increased selling and administrative expenses by 26 percent selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to 348 percent in 2011 from 369 percent in 2010 due to the higher level of sales and the favorable effects of restructuring activities 

in 2011 restructuring initiatives were announced in the adhesive dispensing systems segment that resulted in severance costs and other termination fees of 1589 in 2008 a cost reduction program that involved a combination of nonworkforce related efficiencies and workforce reductions primarily in the united states and europe was announced total severance and related costs of these actions were 2029 in 2010 which were recorded in the corporate segment 

as a result of the 2011 adhesive dispensing systems segment restructuring initiatives three facilities were written down to their fair value based on thirdparty appraisals total impairment charges for the three facilities were 1811 

operating profit as a percent of sales was 256 percent in 2011 compared to 225 percent in 2010 the increase was primarily due to higher sales volume supported by a more efficient cost structure 

segment operating margins in 2011 and 2010 were as follows 

 

 operating capacity for each of our segments can support fluctuations in order activity without significant changes in operating costs also currency translation affects reported operating margins operating margins for each segment were favorably impacted by a weaker dollar during the year as compared to 2010 

operating profit as a percent of sales for the adhesive dispensing systems segment increased to 344 percent in 2011 from 317 percent in 2010 the increase was primarily due to higher sales volume supported by a more efficient cost structure operating profit for 2011 included impairment losses of 1811 on three facilities that were written down to their fair value and severance costs and other termination fees of 1589 

operating profit as a percent of sales for the advanced technology systems segment was 262 percent in 2011 compared to 228 percent in 2010 the current year included charges of 3003 related to shortterm inventory purchase accounting adjustments the operating profit increase was primarily due to higher sales volume supported by a more efficient cost structure 

operating profit as a percent of sales for the industrial coating systems segment was 148 percent in 2011 compared to 99 percent of sales in 2010 the increase was primarily due to higher sales volume supported by a more efficient cost structure 

interest and other income expense — interest expense in 2011 was 5069 a decrease of 1194 or 191 percent from 2010 the decrease was primarily due to lower borrowing levels and lower interest rates in 2011 other income in 2011 was 3518 compared to 1930 in 2010 included in these amounts were foreign currency gains of 2200 in 2011 and 1221 in 2010 

income taxes — income tax expense in 2011 was 92197 or 293 percent of pretax income as compared to 63271 or 274 percent of pretax income in 2010 

income tax expense for 2011 includes a benefit of 2027 from a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits primarily related to settlements with tax authorities in december 2010 the us congress passed and the president signed the tax relief unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of 2010 which provided retroactive reinstatement of a research credit as a result income tax expense for 2011 includes a tax benefit of 1580 related to research credit generated in 2010 

  

the 2010 effective tax rate was positively impacted by a tax benefit of 10243 from the writeoff of the tax basis in our uv graphics arts and lamps product lines the 2010 tax rate was also positively impacted by the consolidation of certain operations and legal entities resulting in a 3616 tax benefit and by the utilization of foreign operating tax loss carryforwards 

the 2010 effective rate was negatively impacted by an additional tax charge of 5249 resulting from the enactment of the patient protection and affordable care act and the subsequent enactment of the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 this charge was due to a reduction in the value of a deferred tax asset as a result of a change to the tax treatment associated with medicare part d subsidies 

net income loss — net income was 222364 or 325 per diluted share in 2011 compared to net income of 168048 or 246 per diluted share in 2010 

recently issued accounting standards — in october 2009 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued authoritative guidance on multipledeliverable revenue arrangements that addresses the unit of accounting for arrangements involving multiple deliverables the guidance also addresses how arrangement consideration should be allocated to separate units of accounting when applicable and expands the disclosure requirements for multipledeliverable arrangements we adopted this standard on november 1 2010 and there were no material changes to our revenue deferral amounts 

in december 2010 the fasb issued guidance that provides requirements over pro forma revenue and earnings disclosures related to business combinations this guidance will require disclosure of revenue and earnings of the combined business as if the combination occurred at the start of the prior annual reporting period only this guidance is effective beginning in 2012 and is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 

in may 2011 the fasb clarified the guidance around fair value measurements and disclosures the guidance requires the disclosure of quantitative information about unobservable inputs used a description of the valuation processes used and a qualitative discussion around the sensitivity of the measurements it will be effective beginning in the second quarter of 2012 we do not expect the adoption will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in june 2011 the fasb issued an accounting standards update asu that amends current comprehensive income guidance this asu eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of shareholders’ equity instead comprehensive income must be reported in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income which contains two sections net income and other comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements this guidance will be effective beginning in 2013 and is not expected to impact our consolidated financial statements as it only results in a change in the format of presentation 

in september 2011 the fasb issued guidance amending the way companies test for goodwill impairment companies will have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances companies determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount then performing the twostep impairment test is unnecessary this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2011 with early adoption permitted we do not expect the adoption will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 

2010 and 2009 

sales — worldwide sales for 2010 were 1041551 an increase of 271 percent from 2009 sales of 819165 sales volume increased 255 percent and favorable currency effects caused by the weaker us dollar increased sales by 16 percent

sales of the adhesive dispensing systems segment were 525290 in 2010 an increase of 64544 or 140 percent from 2009 sales of 460746 the increase was the result of a sales volume increase of 120 percent and favorable currency effects that increased sales by 20 percent sales volume increased in all geographic regions and was particularly strong in asia pacific 

  

sales of the advanced technology systems segment were 369449 in 2010 an increase of 127202 or 525 percent from 2009 sales of 242247 the increase was the result of a sales volume increase of 519 percent and favorable currency effects that increased sales by 06 percent within the segment significant volume increases occurred in all geographic regions and were most pronounced in asia pacific due to higher demand in consumer electronics end markets 

in 2010 sales of the industrial coating systems segment were 146812 an increase of 30640 or 264 percent from 2009 sales of 116172 the increase was the result of a sales volume increase of 246 percent and favorable currency effects that increased sales by 18 percent sales volume which increased in all geographic regions except japan was most pronounced in asia pacific 

sales outside the united states accounted for 737 percent of our sales in 2010 up from 714 percent last year sales increased in all five geographic regions in which we operate in the united states sales were 273652 in 2010 an increase of 169 percent from 2009 in the americas sales were 78058 up 287 percent from 2009 sales volume increased 211 percent and favorable currency effects increased sales by 76 percent in europe sales were 336119 in 2010 an increase of 140 percent from 2009 sales volume increased 144 percent and unfavorable currency effects reduced sales by 04 percent in japan sales were 93318 up 143 percent from 2009 sales volume increased 84 percent and favorable currency effects added 59 percent in asia pacific sales were 260404 in 2010 an increase of 761 percent from 2009 sales volume increased 730 percent and favorable currency effects added 31 percent 

it is estimated that the effect of pricing on total revenue was neutral relative to 2009 

operating profit — cost of sales in 2010 were 419937 up 199 percent from 2009 the increase compared to 2009 is due to increased sales volume gross margins expressed as a percentage of sales increased to 597 percent in 2010 from 572 percent in 2009 the gross margin percentage increase in 2010 was due to higher absorption of fixed overhead costs the impact of cost reduction activities taken in 2009 more profitable product line mix and favorable currency effects 

selling and administrative expenses excluding severance and restructuring costs were 384752 in 2010 an increase of 47458 or 141 percent from 2009 the increase was largely due to higher incentive compensation expenses resulting from a higher level of business activity in 2010 in addition currency translation effects increased selling and administrative costs by 15 percent selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to 369 percent in 2010 from 412 percent in 2009 due to the higher level of sales and the favorable effects of restructuring activities 

on june 30 2010 we sold our graphic arts and lamps product lines to baldwin technology company inc these product lines were reported in the advanced technology systems segment we recognized a pretax loss on disposition of 357 which is reflected in selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of income results of operations and net assets of the divested product lines were immaterial to our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in september 2008 a cost reduction program that involved a combination of nonworkforce related efficiencies and workforce reductions primarily in the united states and europe was announced in response to the continuing economic crisis additional cost reduction actions were taken in 2009 and 2010 total severance and related costs of these actions were 5561 in 2008 and 16396 in 2009 and 2029 in 2010 severance costs were recorded in the corporate segment 

in 2009 we recognized goodwill and longlived asset impairment charges of 243043 of this amount 232789 related to goodwill 8282 related to indefinite lived trade name assets and 1972 related to other longlived assets additional information regarding these charges is described in the critical accounting policies and estimates section 

operating profit as a percent of sales was 225 percent in 2010 compared to negative 156 percent in 2009 goodwill and longlived impairment charges accounted for 297 percent of the 381 percent change the remainder of the change was primarily due to sales mix yielding higher gross margins effects of cost reduction activities taken in 2008 and 2009 that resulted in operating costs increasing at a slower rate than sales and higher severance and restructuring costs in 2009 

  

segment operating margins in 2010 and 2009 were as follows 

 

 operating capacity for each of our segments can support fluctuations in order activity without significant changes in operating costs also currency translation affects reported operating margins in 2010 operating margins for each segment were favorably impacted by a weaker dollar during the year as compared to 2009 

operating profit as a percent of sales for the adhesive dispensing systems segment increased to 317 percent in 2010 from 277 percent in 2009 the increase was primarily due to higher gross margin percentages and to sales volume increasing at a higher rate than selling and administrative expenses 

operating profit as a percent of sales for the advanced technology systems segment was 228 percent in 2010 compared to an operating loss of 887 percent of sales in 2009 the change was due primarily to goodwill and longlived asset impairment charges of 239427 in 2009 excluding these impairment charges operating margin was 102 percent the increase from 102 percent to 228 percent was primarily due to sales volume increasing at a higher rate than selling and administrative expenses 

operating profit as a percent of sales for the industrial coating systems segment was 99 percent in 2010 compared to an operating loss of 59 percent of sales in 2009 operating profit in 2009 included a goodwill impairment charge of 3616 excluding this charge operating margin was negative 28 percent in 2009 the profitability improvement in 2010 was primarily due to higher gross margin percentages and to sales volume increasing at a higher rate than selling and administrative expenses 

interest and other income expense — interest expense in 2010 was 6263 a decrease of 1508 or 194 percent from 2009 the decrease was primarily due to lower borrowing levels in 2010 interest income was 819 in 2010 up from 492 in 2009 the increase was primarily due to a higher level of shortterm investments in 2010 other income in 2010 was 1930 compared to 7895 in 2009 included in these amounts were foreign currency gains of 1221 in 2010 and 1571 in 2009 other income in 2009 also included a 5011 gain on the sale of real estate in westlake ohio 

income taxes — income tax expense in 2010 was 63271 or 274 percent of pretax income income tax expense in 2009 was 32864 most of the goodwill and longlived asset impairment charges recorded in 2009 were not deductible for income tax purposes 

the 2010 effective tax rate was positively impacted by a tax benefit of 10243 from the writeoff of the tax basis in our uv graphics arts and lamps product lines the 2010 tax rate was also positively impacted by consolidation of certain operations and legal entities resulting in a 3616 tax benefit and by the utilization of foreign operating tax loss carryforwards 

the 2010 effective rate was negatively impacted by an additional tax charge of 5249 resulting from the enactment of the patient protection and affordable care act and the subsequent enactment of the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 this charge was due to a reduction in the value of a deferred tax asset as a result of a change to the tax treatment associated with medicare part d subsidies

cash provided by operating activities was 246727 in 2011 up from 140186 in 2010 the primary sources were net income noncash items and the tax benefit from the exercise of stock options the sum of which is 251299 compared to 213756 in 2010 operating assets and liabilities used 4572 of cash in 2011 compared to 73570 in 2010 the primary reasons for the change were a smaller increase in accounts receivable from 2010 to 2011 as compared to the increase from 2009 to 2010 and onetime postretirement payments and cash contributions to us pension plans totaling 79514 in 2010 

  

cash used by investing activities was 305506 in 2011 as compared to 41324 in 2010 capital expenditures were 20239 in 2011 up from 14317 in the prior year significant capital expenditures in 2011 included the continuing rollout of sap enterprise management software completion of our new corporate headquarters building that replaced the facility sold in 2009 and various projects that improve manufacturing and distribution operations the acquisitions of micromedics verbruggen and value plastics used cash of 292980 in 2011 and the acquisition of glt used cash of 18576 in 2010 cash proceeds of 7552 were received in 2011 from the maturity of bank certificates of deposit that had been purchased in 2010 and classified as shortterm marketable securities

the following is a summary of significant changes by balance sheet caption from october 31 2010 to october 31 2011 receivables increased due to higher accounts and notes receivable resulting from higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 this increase was partially offset by a decrease in other receivables due to a lower value of foreign exchange contracts the increase in inventories is due to a higher level of business activity in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 and inventory held by three acquisitions completed in 2011 goodwill increased primarily due to three acquisitions completed in 2011 that added 200823 of goodwill the increase in other intangibles — net was due to 86237 of intangibles added as a result of the 2011 acquisitions partially offset by 8018 of amortization the increase in accounts payable is primarily due to a higher level of business activity in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 and accounts payable of three acquisitions completed in 2011 the decrease in income taxes payable is largely due to higher estimated us tax payments in 2011 the increase in accrued liabilities is primarily due to accruals for salaries and incentive compensation current maturities of longterm debt decreased due to scheduled repayments of senior notes the increase in longterm pension and retirement obligations and longterm postretirement obligations is the result of a decrease in the discount rate for us plans lower expected returns on pension assets and updated demographic assumptions longterm deferred tax liabilities increased primarily as a result of purchase accounting adjustments related to the 2011 acquisitions partially offset by the tax effect of pension and postretirement amounts recorded in other comprehensive income 

in december 2008 the board of directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to 1000 shares and 513 shares were repurchased under this program through february 2011 in may 2011 the board of directors approved a program that replaced the december 2008 program with a new program that allowed for the repurchase of up to 2000 shares this program was completed in september 2011 and the board of directors approved an additional repurchase program of up to 100000 uses for repurchased shares include the funding of benefit programs including stock options nonvested stock and 401k matching during 2011 we repurchased 3024 shares within these programs for a total amount of 134163 using working capital and proceeds from borrowings under our credit facilities 

  

the following table summarizes contractual obligations as of october 31 2011 

 

 1 we have a 400000 unsecured multicurrency credit facility with a group of banks that expires in 2012 and may be increased to 500000 under certain conditions at october 31 2011 192200 was outstanding under this facility compared to 46000 outstanding at october 31 2010 there are two primary financial covenants that must be met under this facility the first covenant limits the amount of total indebtedness that can be incurred to 35 times consolidated trailing ebitda both indebtedness and ebitda as defined in the credit agreement the second covenant requires consolidated trailing ebitda to be at least three times consolidated trailing interest expense both as defined in the credit agreement at october 31 2011 we were in compliance with all debt covenants and the amount we could borrow under the credit facility would not have been limited by any debt covenants borrowings under this credit facility were classified as due after five years because a new revolving credit agreement was entered into on december 9 2011 that expires on december 9 2016 see note 21 

in 2008 we entered into a note purchase and private shelf agreement the agreement with prudential investment management inc the agreement consists of a 50000 senior note and a 100000 private shelf facility the private shelf facility expired in february 2011 the senior note bears interest at a rate of 498 percent and matures on february 22 2013 and is unsecured the agreement contains customary events of default and covenants related to limitations on indebtedness and the maintenance of certain financial ratios we were in compliance with all covenants at october 31 2011

2 see note 6 for additional information 

3 we have various lines of credit with foreign banks totaling 43305 of which 43272 was unused at october 31 2011 see note 7 for additional information 

4 pension and postretirement plan funding amounts after 2012 will be determined based on the future funded status of the plans and therefore cannot be estimated at this time see note 3 for additional information 

5 purchase obligations primarily represent commitments for materials used in our manufacturing processes that are not recorded in our consolidated balance sheet 

we believe that the combination of present capital resources internally generated funds and unused financing sources are more than adequate to meet cash requirements for 2012 there are no significant restrictions limiting the transfer of funds from international subsidiaries to the parent company 

  

outlook 

our operating performance and balance sheet position for 2011 were both stronger than 2010 as we continued to experience excellent recovery since 2009 which was affected by disruptions in global financial markets and the general economic environment going forward we are wellpositioned to manage our liquidity needs that arise from working capital requirements capital expenditures and principal and interest payments on indebtedness primary sources of capital to meet these needs are cash provided by operations and borrowings under our loan agreements in 2011 cash from operations was 20 percent of revenue compared to 13 percent in 2010 which included voluntary contributions to our us pension plans and onetime postretirement payments representing 8 percent of revenue funds provided by borrowings occurred under a 400000 fiveyear committed revolving line of credit with a group of domestic and international banks that was set to expire in 2012 as of december 9 2011 we replaced our existing revolving loan agreement and balances outstanding under the prior facility were transferred to a new 500000 unsecured multicurrency credit facility with a group of banks this facility has a fiveyear term and includes a 40000 subfacility for swingline loans it may be increased from 500000 to 750000 under certain conditions as of october 31 2011 we had 207800 under the previous facility as available borrowing capacity which has been expanded under the replacement facility in addition in june 2011 we entered into a 150000 threeyear private shelf agreement with new york life investment management llc as of october 31 we had 75000 borrowing capacity while these facilities provide the contractual terms for any borrowing we cannot be assured that these facilities would be available in the event that these financial institutions failed to remain sufficiently capitalized 

we move forward with caution in our approach to 2012 given the global economic uncertainty that is primarily due to anxiety over european sovereign debt issues the rebound effect in order growth since 2009 has moderated to more normal business levels though the near term global macroeconomic outlook remains somewhat unclear our growth potential has been demonstrated over time from our capacity to build and enhance our core by entering emerging markets and pursuing market adjacencies we drive value for our customers through our application expertise differentiated technology and direct sales and service support our priorities also are focused on continued operational improvements by employing lean methodologies to our business processes we expect these efforts will provide sufficient cash from operations to meet our liquidity needs as well as enable us to invest in the development of new applications and markets for our technologies and pursue strategic acquisition opportunities with respect to contractual spending the table above presents our financial obligations as 427882 of which 74948 is payable in 2012 in september 2011 the board of directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to 100000 the repurchase program is being funded using working capital and proceeds from borrowings under our credit facilities under this authorization the timing and actual number of shares subject to repurchase are at the discretion of management and are contingent on a number of factors including levels of cash generation from operations cash requirements for acquisitions repayment of debt and our share price capital expenditures for 2012 will be focused primarily upon our continued efforts to leverage our information systems platform as well as various projects that improve manufacturing and distribution operations 

effects of foreign currency 

the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on sales and operating results cannot be precisely measured due to fluctuating selling prices sales volume product mix and cost structures in each country where we operate as a general rule a weakening of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies has a favorable effect on sales and net income while a strengthening of the dollar has a detrimental effect 

in 2011 as compared with 2010 the united states dollar was generally weaker against foreign currencies if 2010 exchange rates had been in effect during 2011 sales would have been approximately 33499 lower and thirdparty costs would have been approximately 17872 lower in 2010 as compared with 2009 the united states dollar was generally weaker against foreign currencies if 2009 exchange rates had been in effect during 2010 sales would have been approximately 12944 lower and thirdparty costs would have been approximately 5208 lower these effects on reported sales do not include the impact of local price adjustments made in response to changes in currency exchange rates

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we operate internationally and enter into intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies consequently we are subject to market risk arising from exchange rate movements between the dates foreign currencies are recorded and the dates they are settled we regularly use foreign exchange contracts to reduce our risks related to most of these transactions these contracts primarily associated with the euro yen and pound sterling typically have maturities of 90 days or less and generally require the exchange of foreign currencies for united states dollars at rates stated in the contracts gains and losses from changes in the market value of these contracts offset foreign exchange losses and gains respectively on the underlying transactions other transactions denominated in foreign currencies are designated as hedges of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries or are intercompany transactions of a longterm investment nature as a result of the use of foreign exchange contracts on a routine basis to reduce the risks related to most of our transactions denominated in foreign currencies as of october 31 2011 we did not have material foreign currency exposure 

note 9 to the financial statements contains additional information about our foreign currency transactions and the methods and assumptions used to record these transactions 

a portion of our operations is financed with shortterm and longterm borrowings and is subject to market risk arising from changes in interest rates 

the tables that follow present principal repayments and related weightedaverage interest rates by expected maturity dates of fixedrate debt 

at october 31 2011 

 

 at october 31 2010 

 

 we also have variablerate notes payable and longterm debt the weighted average interest rate of this debt was 05 percent at october 31 2011 and 07 percent at october 31 2010 a one percent increase in interest rates would have resulted in additional interest expense of approximately 785 on the variable rate notes payable and longterm debt in 2011 

  

inflation 

inflation affects profit margins as the ability to pass cost increases on to customers is restricted by the need for competitive pricing although inflation has been modest in recent years and has had no material effect on the years covered by these financial statements we continue to seek ways to minimize the impact of inflation through focused efforts to increase productivity 

trends 

the fiveyear summary in item 6 documents our historical financial trends over this period the world’s economic conditions fluctuated significantly our solid performance is attributed to our participation in diverse geographic and industrial markets and our longterm commitment to develop and provide quality products and worldwide service to meet our customers’ changing needs

manufacturing and raw materials 

our production operations include machining and assembly we manufacture specially designed parts and assemble components into finished equipment many components are made in standard modules that can be used in more than one product or in combination with other components for a variety of models we have principal manufacturing operations in the united states in amherst ohio norcross swainsboro and dawsonville georgia carlsbad california robbinsville new jersey and east providence rhode island as well as in shanghai and suzhou china luneburg germany bangalore india maastricht the netherlands and in aylesbury united kingdom 

 

principal materials used to make our products are metals and plastics typically in sheets bar stock castings forgings and tubing we also purchase many electrical and electronic components fabricated metal parts highpressure fluid hoses packings seals and other items integral to our products suppliers are competitively selected based on cost quality and service all significant raw materials that we use are available through multiple sources 

 

senior operating executives supervise an extensive quality control program for our equipment machinery and systems 

 

natural gas and other fuels are our primary energy sources however standby capacity for alternative sources is available if needed 

 

intellectual property 

we maintain procedures to protect our intellectual property including patents trademarks and copyrights both domestically and internationally risk factors associated with our intellectual property are discussed in item 1a risk factors 

 

our intellectual property portfolios include valuable patents trade secrets knowhow domain names trademarks and trade names as of october 31 2010 we held 343 united states patents and 732 foreign patents and had 157 united states patent applications and 711 foreign patent applications pending but there is no assurance that any patent application will be issued we continue to apply for and obtain patent protection for new products on an ongoing basis 

 

patents covering individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of filing or grant and legal term of patents in various countries where a patent is obtained our current patent portfolio has expiration dates ranging from november 2010 to march 2035 the actual protection a patent provides which can vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in each country we believe however that the duration of our patents generally exceeds the life cycles of the technologies disclosed and claimed in the patents 

 

we believe our trademarks are important assets and we aggressively manage our brands we also own a number of trademarks in the united states and foreign countries including registered trademarks for nordson asymtek colormax control coat dage efd and saturn and various common law trademarks which are important to our business inasmuch as they identify nordson and our products to our customers as of october 31 2010 we had a total of 1010 trademark registrations in the united states and in various foreign countries 

 

we rely upon a combination of nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights and also enter into confidentiality and intellectual property agreements with our employees that require them to disclose any inventions created during employment convey all rights to inventions to us and restrict the distribution of proprietary information 

 

we protect and promote our intellectual property portfolio and take those actions we deem appropriate to enforce our intellectual property rights and to defend our right to sell our products although in aggregate our intellectual property is important to our operations we do not believe that the loss of any one patent trademark or group of related patents or trademarks would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position of our overall business 

 

seasonal variation in business 

generally the highest volume of sales occurs in our fourth quarter due in large part to the timing of customers’ capital spending programs first quarter sales volume is typically the lowest of the year due to customer holiday shutdowns 

 

working capital practices 

no special or unusual practices affect our working capital however we generally require advance payments as deposits on customized equipment and systems and in certain cases require progress payments during the manufacturing of these products we have initiated a number of new processes focused on reduction of manufacturing lead times these initiatives have resulted in lower investment in inventory while maintaining the capability to respond promptly to customer needs 

 

customers 

we serve a broad customer base both in terms of industries and geographic regions in 2010 no single customer accounted for five percent or more of sales 

 

backlog 

our backlog of open orders increased to approximately 128000 at october 31 2010 from approximately 79000 at october 31 2009 the increase can be traced primarily to returning demand in consumer durable goods markets and recovery in technology markets all orders in the 2010 yearend backlog are expected to be shipped to customers in 2011 

 

government contracts 

our business neither includes nor depends upon a significant amount of governmental contracts or subcontracts therefore no material part of our business is subject to renegotiation or termination at the option of the government 

 

competitive conditions 

our equipment is sold in competition with a wide variety of alternative bonding sealing caulking finishing coating testing and inspection techniques any production process that requires surface preparation or modification application of material to a substrate or surface curing or testing and inspection is a potential use for our equipment 

 

many factors influence our competitive position including pricing product quality and service we enjoy a leadership position in our business segments by delivering highquality innovative products and technologies as well as afterthesale service and technical support working with customers to understand their processes and developing the application solutions that help them meet their production requirements also contributes to our leadership position our worldwide network of direct sales and technical resources also is a competitive advantage 

 

research and development 

investments in research and development are important to our longterm growth enabling us to keep pace with changing customer and marketplace needs through the development of new products and new applications for existing products we place strong emphasis on technology developments and improvements through internal engineering and research teams research and development expenses were approximately 23835 in 2010 compared with approximately 25528 in 2009 and 33566 in 2008 

 

environmental compliance 

we are subject to extensive federal state local and foreign environmental safety and health laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to land and water and the generation handling treatment and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials under certain of these laws we can be held strictly liable for hazardous substance contamination of any real property we have ever owned operated or used as a disposal site or for natural resource damages associated with such contamination we are also required to maintain various related permits and licenses many of which require periodic modification and renewal the operation of manufacturing plants unavoidably entails environmental safety and health risks and we could incur material unanticipated costs or liabilities in the future if any of these risks were realized in ways or to an extent that we did not anticipate 

 

we believe that we operate in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations compliance with environmental laws and regulations requires continuing management effort and expenditures we have incurred and will continue to incur costs and capital expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations and to obtain and maintain the necessary permits and licenses we believe that the cost of complying with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material affect on our earnings liquidity or competitive position but cannot assure that material compliancerelated costs and expenses may not arise in the future for example future adoption of new or amended environmental laws regulations or requirements or newly discovered contamination or other circumstances that require us to incur costs and expenses that cannot be presently anticipated 

 

we believe that policies practices and procedures have been properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of material environmental damage arising from our operations we accrue for estimated environmental liabilities with charges to expense and believe our environmental accrual is adequate to provide for our portion of the costs of all such known environmental liabilities compliance with federal state and local environmental protection laws during 2010 had no material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position based upon consideration of currently available information we believe liabilities for environmental matters will not have a material adverse affect on our financial position operating results or liquidity but we cannot assure that material environmental liabilities may not arise in the future 

 

employees 

as of october 31 2010 we had 3680 full and parttime employees including 133 at our amherst ohio facility who are represented by a collective bargaining agreement that expires on november 3 2013 no material work stoppages have been experienced at any of our facilities during any of the periods covered by this report

 item 1a risk factors 

 

in an enterprise as diverse as ours a wide range of factors could affect future performance we discuss in this section some of the risk factors that if they actually occurred could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition value and results of operations you should consider these risk factors in connection with evaluating the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k because these factors could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected in forwardlooking statements 

 

the significant risk factors affecting our operations include the following 

 

changes in united states or international economic conditions could adversely affect the profitability of any of our operations 

in 2010 27 percent of our revenue was derived from domestic customers while 73 percent was derived from international customers our largest markets include appliance automotive bookbinding construction container converting electronics assembly food and beverage furniture life sciences and medical light emitting diodes led metal finishing nonwovens packaging and semiconductor a slowdown in any of these specific end markets could directly affect our revenue stream and profitability 

 

a portion of our product sales is attributable to industries and markets such as the semiconductor and metal finishing industries which historically have been cyclical and sensitive to relative changes in supply and demand and general economic conditions the demand for our products depends in part on the general economic conditions of the industries or national economies of our customers downward economic cycles in our customers’ industries or countries may reduce sales of some of our products it is not possible to predict accurately the factors that will affect demand for our products in the future 

 

any significant downturn in the health of the general economy either globally regionally or in the markets in which we sell products could have an adverse effect on our revenues and financial performance resulting in impairment of assets 

 

significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates or change in monetary policy may harm our financial results 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly with respect to the euro the yen and the british pound any significant change in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business against the united states dollar could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for additional detail related to this risk see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

 

the majority of our consolidated revenues in 2010 were generated in currencies other than the united states dollar which is our reporting currency we recognize foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from our operations in the period incurred as a result currency fluctuations between the united states dollar and the currencies in which we do business have caused and will continue to cause foreign currency transaction and translation gains and losses which historically have been material and could continue to be material we cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future operating results because of the number of currencies involved the variability of currency exposures and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates we take actions to manage our foreign currency exposure such as entering into hedging transactions where available but we cannot assure that our strategies will adequately protect our consolidated operating results from the effects of exchange rate fluctuations 

 

we also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into united states dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or customers located in or conducting business in a country imposing controls currency devaluations diminish the united states dollar value of the currency of the country instituting the devaluation and if they occur or continue for significant periods could adversely affect our earnings or cash flow 

we could be adversely affected by rapid changes in interest rates 

any period of unexpected or rapid increase in interest rates may also adversely affect our profitability at october 31 2010 we had 112420 of total debt outstanding of which 43 percent was priced at interest rates that float with the market a one percent increase in the interest rate on the floating rate debt in 2010 would have resulted in approximately 1073 of additional interest expense a higher level of floating rate debt would increase the exposure discussed above for additional detail related to this risk see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

 

inability to access capital could impede growth or the repayment or refinancing of existing indebtedness 

the limits imposed on us by the restrictive covenants contained in our credit facilities could prevent us from making acquisitions or cause us to lose access to these facilities 

 

our existing credit facilities contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to among other things 

 

  

in addition our credit facilities require us to meet financial ratios including total indebtedness to consolidated trailing ebitda both as defined in the credit facility and consolidated trailing ebitda to consolidated trailing interest expense as defined in the credit facility 

 

these restrictions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs and could otherwise restrict our financing activities 

 

our ability to comply with the covenants and other terms of our credit facilities will depend on our future operating performance if we fail to comply with such covenants and terms we will be in default and the maturity of the related debt could be accelerated and become immediately due and payable we may be required to obtain waivers from our lenders in order to maintain compliance under our credit facilities including waivers with respect to our compliance with certain financial covenants if we are unable to obtain necessary waivers and the debt under our credit facilities is accelerated we would be required to obtain replacement financing at prevailing market rates 

 

we may need new or additional financing in the future to expand our business or refinance existing indebtedness if we are unable to access capital on satisfactory terms and conditions we may not be able to expand our business or meet our payment requirements under our existing credit facilities our ability to obtain new or additional financing will depend on a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control we may not be able to obtain new or additional financing because we have substantial debt or because we may not have sufficient cash flow to service or repay our existing or future debt in addition depending on market conditions and our financial performance neither debt nor equity financing may be available on satisfactory terms or at all finally as a consequence of worsening financial market conditions our credit facility providers may not provide the agreed capital if they become undercapitalized 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions and we may not be able to make acquisitions of suitable candidates or integrate acquisitions successfully 

our recent historical growth has depended and our future growth is likely to continue to depend in part on our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses into our existing operations we intend to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world we cannot assure however that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates prevail against competing potential acquirers negotiate appropriate acquisition terms obtain financing that may be needed to consummate such acquisitions complete proposed acquisitions successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new markets in addition we cannot assure that any acquisition once successfully integrated will perform as planned be accretive to earnings or prove to be beneficial to our operations and cash flow 

 

the success of any acquisition is subject to other risks and uncertainties including 

 

  

in addition an acquisition could adversely impact our operating performance as a result of the incurrence of acquisitionrelated debt acquisition expenses or the amortization of acquisitionacquired assets 

 

we may also face liability with respect to acquired businesses for violations of environmental laws occurring prior to the date of our acquisition and some or all of these liabilities may not be covered by environmental insurance secured to mitigate the risk or by indemnification from the sellers from which we acquired these businesses we could also incur significant costs including but not limited to remediation costs natural resources damages civil or criminal fines and sanctions and thirdparty claims as a result of past or future violations of or liabilities associated with environmental laws 

 

the inability to continue to develop new products could limit our revenue and profitability 

innovation is critical to our success we believe that we must continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and manufacture new products with improved capabilities in order to continue to be a market leader we also believe that we must continue to make improvements in our productivity in order to maintain our competitive position our inability to anticipate respond to or utilize changing technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated results of operations 

our inability to protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect product sales and financial performance 

difficulties in acquiring and maintaining our intellectual property rights could also adversely affect our business and financial position our performance may depend in part on our ability to establish protect and enforce intellectual property rights with respect to our patented technologies and proprietary rights and to defend against any claims of infringement these activities involve complex and constantly evolving legal scientific and factual questions and uncertainties our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends in part on our ability to maintain and enforce our patents and other proprietary rights which are essential to our business these measures afford only limited protection and may not in all cases prevent our competitors from gaining access to our intellectual property and proprietary information 

 

litigation has been and may continue to be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets and to determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights in addition we may face claims of infringement that could interfere with our ability to use technology or other intellectual property rights that are material to our business operations if litigation that we initiate is unsuccessful we may not be able to protect the value of some of our intellectual property if a claim of infringement against us is successful we may be required to pay royalties or license fees to continue to use technology or other intellectual property rights that we have been using or we may be unable to obtain necessary licenses from third parties at a reasonable cost or within a reasonable time if we are unable to timely obtain licenses on reasonable terms we may be forced to cease selling or using any of our products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property or to redesign or in the case of trademark claims rename our products to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties this may not always be possible or if possible may be time consuming and expensive intellectual property litigation whether successful or unsuccessful could be expensive to us and divert some of our resources our intellectual property rights may not be as valuable as we believe which could result in a competitive disadvantage or adversely affect our business and financial performance 

 

political conditions in foreign countries in which we operate could adversely affect us 

we conduct our manufacturing sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and are subject to risks associated with doing business outside the united states in 2010 approximately 73 percent of our total sales were to customers outside the united states we expect that international operations and united states export sales will continue to be important to our business for the foreseeable future both the sales from international operations and export sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside the united states such risks include but are not limited to the following 

 

  

any of these events could reduce the demand for our products limit the prices at which we can sell our products or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operating performance

2 — advanced technology systems 

3 — industrial coating systems 

 

the facilities listed above have adequate suitable and sufficient capacity production and nonproduction to meet present and foreseeable demand for our products 

 

other properties at international subsidiary locations and at branch locations within the united states are leased lease terms do not exceed 25 years and generally contain a provision for cancellation with some penalty at an earlier date 

 

in addition we lease equipment under various operating and capitalized leases information about leases is reported in note 6 of notes to consolidated financial statements that can be found in part ii item 8 of this document 

 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

 

we are involved in pending or potential litigation regarding environmental product liability patent contract employee and other matters arising from the normal course of business including the environmental matter discussed below it is our opinion after consultation with legal counsel that resolutions of these matters are not expected to result in a material effect on our financial condition quarterly or annual operating results or cash flows 

 

environmental — we have voluntarily agreed with the city of new richmond wisconsin and other potentially responsible parties to share costs associated with the remediation of the city of new richmond municipal landfill the “site” and constructing a potable water delivery system serving the impacted area down gradient of the site at october 31 2010 and 2009 our accrual for the ongoing operation maintenance and monitoring obligation at the site was 885 

 

the liability for environmental remediation represents management’s best estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable undiscounted costs related to known remediation obligations the accuracy of our estimate of environmental liability is affected by several uncertainties such as additional requirements that may be identified in connection with remedial activities the complexity and evolution of environmental laws and regulations and the identification of presently unknown remediation requirements consequently our liability could be greater than our current estimate however we do not expect that the costs associated with remediation will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses on an ongoing basis we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that are used to prepare financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates used by management 

 

certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below on a regular basis critical accounting policies are reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 

 

revenue recognition  — most of our revenues are recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the sales price is fixed or determinable collectibility is reasonably assured and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer revenues from contracts with multiple element arrangements such as those including installation or other services are recognized as each element is earned based on objective evidence of the relative fair value of each element if the installation or other services are inconsequential to the functionality of the delivered product the entire amount of revenue is recognized upon satisfaction of the criteria noted above inconsequential installation or other services are those that can generally be completed in a short period of time at insignificant cost and the skills required to complete these installations are not unique to us if installation or other services are essential to the functionality of the delivered product revenues attributable to these obligations are deferred until completed amounts received in excess of revenue recognized are included as deferred revenue within accrued liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets revenues deferred in 2010 2009 and 2008 were not material 

 

goodwill  — goodwill is the excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in various business combinations goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level or more often if indications of impairment exist for 2010 and 2009 our reporting units are the adhesive dispensing systems segment the industrial coating systems segment and one level below the advanced technology systems segment reporting units in the advanced technology systems segment in 2010 are consistent with those used in 2009 except that picodostec and yestech are now included in the efd and dage reporting units respectively 

the goodwill impairment test is a twostep process in the first step performed in the fourth quarter of each year we calculate a reporting unit’s fair value using a discounted cash flow valuation methodology and compare the result against the reporting unit’s carrying value of net assets if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value then a second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired in step one the assumptions used for discounted cash flow revenue growth operating margin and working capital turnover are based on general management’s strategic plans tempered by performance trends and reasonable expectations about those trends terminal value calculations employ a published formula known as the “gordon growth model method” that essentially captures the present value of perpetual cash flows beyond the last projected period assuming a constant weighted average cost of capital methodology wacc and growth rate for each reporting unit sensitivity calculations vary the discount and terminal growth rates in order to provide a range of assurance that our expected assumptions are fair for detecting impairment 

 

discount rates were developed using a wacc methodology the wacc represents the blended average required rate of return for equity and debt capital based on observed market return data and company specific risk factors for 2010 the discount rates used ranged from 10 percent to 19 percent depending upon the reporting unit’s size end market volatility and projection risk the calculated internal rate of return for the step one consolidated valuation was 113 percent the same as the calculated wacc for total nordson 

 

to test the reasonableness of the discounted cash flow valuations we performed the control premium test which compares the sum of the fair values calculated for our reporting units net of debt to the market value of equity the control premium was 7 percent as of the test date of july 31 2010 and negative 12 percent as of our yearend of october 31 2010 these comparisons indicated that the discounted cash flow valuation was reasonable in addition indications of value derived for each reporting unit using the market approach reconciled reasonably with the results of the discounted cash flow approach 

 

in 2010 the results of our step one testing indicated no impairment therefore the second step of impairment testing was not necessary 

 

in 2009 we determined that the second step of impairment testing was necessary in the second step a hypothetical purchase price allocation of the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities is performed using the fair value calculated in step one the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the hypothetical fair value of assets and liabilities is the implied goodwill amount impairment is recorded if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is higher than its implied goodwill based upon the results of our impairment testing we recognized an impairment charge for a reduction in the carrying value of goodwill in the amount of 232789 relating to six reporting units as follows dage 166916 picodostec 7530 yestech 26149 march plasma systems 16449 uv curing 12129 and industrial coating systems 3616 

 

the excess of fair value fv over carrying value cv was compared to the carrying value for each reporting unit based on the results shown in the table below our conclusion is that no indicators of impairment exist potential events or circumstances resulting in a negative effect to the estimated fair value could range from a further downturn in global economies to a much slower recovery than assumed 

 

 

indefinitelived intangible assets  — indefinitelived intangible assets are trademarks and trade names associated with dage picodostec and yestech these assets are not subject to amortization and must be tested for impairment annually or more often if indications of impairment exist the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess after an impairment charge is recognized the adjusted carrying amount of the intangible asset becomes its new accounting basis subsequent reversal of a previously recognized impairment charge is prohibited 

 

the common valuation technique for trademark and trade names is the “relief from royalty method” the theory is that these assets relieve the owner from having to pay a hypothetical royalty attributable to an exclusive license for selling products under the trademark or trade name the value of the hypothetical exclusive license is based upon the present value of a stream of hypothetical royalty payments using assumptions for revenue growth the same as for goodwill testing discount rates slightly more risk premium than for goodwill testing royalty rates based on market data and tax amortization benefits based upon statutory guidance 

 

no impairment charges related to indefinitelived intangible assets were recorded in 2010 impairment charges totaling 8282 were recorded in 2009 as follows by reporting unit dage 5365 picodostec 157 yestech 350 and tah industries 2410 the charge for the tah trade name was due to our branding program under which tah product lines are being integrated into and marketed as “nordson efd” over the next several years accordingly the tah trade name was converted to a finitelived asset 

 

other longlived assets  — our test for recoverability of longlived depreciable and amortizable assets used undiscounted cash flows longlived assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows the total carrying value of longlived assets for each reporting unit has been compared to the forecasted cash flows of each reporting unit’s longlived assets being tested cash flows have been defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization less annual maintenance capital spending 

 

estimates of future cash flows used to test the recoverability of a longlived asset asset group are based on the remaining useful life of the asset we believe that the relative value of longlived assets within each reporting unit is a reasonable proxy for the relative importance of the assets in the production of cash flow to get to a reasonable forecast period the aggregate net book value of longlived assets was divided by the current depreciation and amortization value to arrive at a blended remaining useful life our calculations for 2010 showed the undiscounted aggregate value of cash flows over the remaining useful life for each reporting unit was greater than the respective carrying value of the lived assets within each reporting unit so no impairment charges were recognized 

 

inventories  — inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market cost was determined using the lastin firstout lifo method for 25 percent of consolidated inventories at october 31 2010 and 26 percent at october 31 2009 with the firstin firstout fifo method used for the remaining inventory on an ongoing basis inventory is tested for technical obsolescence as well as for future demand and changes in market conditions we have historically maintained inventory reserves to reflect those conditions when the cost of inventory is not expected to be recovered reserves are also maintained for inventory used for demonstration purposes the inventory reserve balance was 16802 15740 and 13133 at october 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

 

pension plans and postretirement medical plans  — the measurement of liabilities related to our pension plans and postretirement medical plans is based on management’s assumptions related to future factors including interest rates return on pension plan assets compensation increases mortality and turnover assumptions and health care cost trend rates 

the weightedaverage discount rate used to determine the present value of our domestic pension plan obligations was 521 percent at october 31 2010 and 550 percent at october 31 2009 the discount rate for these plans which comprised 77 percent of the worldwide pension obligations at october 31 2010 was based on quality fixed income investments with a duration period approximately equal to the period over which pension obligations are expected to be settled the weightedaverage discount rate used to determine the present value of our various international pension plan obligations was 417 percent at october 31 2010 compared to 478 percent at october 31 2009 the discount rates used for the international plans were determined by using quality fixed income investments with a duration period approximately equal to the period over which pension obligations are expected to be settled 

 

in determining the expected return on plan assets we consider both historical performance and an estimate of future longterm rates of return on assets similar to those in our plans we consult with and consider the opinions of financial and actuarial experts in developing appropriate return assumptions the expected rate of return longterm investment rate on domestic pension assets was 825 percent at october 31 2010 and 851 percent at october 31 2009 the average expected rate of return on international pension assets was 484 percent at october 31 2010 and 485 percent at october 31 2009 

 

the assumed rate of compensation increases for domestic employees was 330 percent for both 2010 and 2009 the assumed rate of compensation increases for international employees was 321 percent in 2010 compared to 286 percent in 2009 

 

annual expense amounts are determined based on the discount rate used at the end of the prior year differences between actual and assumed investment returns on pension plan assets result in actuarial gains or losses that are amortized into expense over a period of years 

 

economic assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported the effect of a one percent change in the discount rate expected return on assets and compensation increase is shown in the table below bracketed numbers represent decreases in expense and obligation amounts 

 

 

 

with respect to the domestic postretirement medical plan the discount rate used to value the benefit obligation decreased from 550 percent at october 31 2009 to 525 percent at october 31 2010 the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the health care cost trend rate is assumed to be 900 percent in 2011 decreasing gradually to 500 percent in 2020 

 

for the international postretirement plan the discount rate used to value the benefit obligation was 575 percent at october 31 2010 and 675 percent at october 31 2009 the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the health care cost trend rate is assumed to be 680 percent in 2011 decreasing gradually to 480 percent in 2013 

the discount rate and the health care cost trend rate assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported for example a onepercentage point change in the discount rate and assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects 

 

 

 

employees hired after january 1 2002 are not eligible to participate in the domestic postretirement medical plan 

 

pension and postretirement expenses in 2011 are expected to be approximately 5000 lower than 2010 primarily due to a settlement loss in 2010 resulting from a lump sum retirement payment 

 

financial instruments  — assets liabilities and commitments that are to be settled in cash and are denominated in foreign currencies are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates we enter into foreign currency forward contracts which are derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of foreign currency exposures resulting from the collection of receivables payables and loans denominated in foreign currencies the maturities of these contracts are usually less than 90 days forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and therefore are marked to market each accounting period and the resulting gains or losses are included in “other — net” within other income expense in the consolidated statement of income 

 

warranties  — we provide customers with a product warranty that requires us to repair or replace defective products within a specified period of time generally one year from the date of delivery or first use an accrual is recorded for expected warranty costs for products shipped through the end of each accounting period in determining the amount of the accrual we rely primarily on historical warranty claims amounts charged to the warranty reserve were 6068 3824 and 6070 in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the reserve balance was 5242 4587 and 5336 at october 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

 

longterm incentive compensation plan ltip  — under the longterm incentive compensation plan executive officers and selected other employees receive stock payouts based solely on corporate performance measures over threeyear performance periods payouts vary based on the degree to which corporate performance equals or exceeds predetermined threshold target and maximum performance levels at the end of a performance period no payout will occur unless certain threshold performance objectives are equaled or exceeded the amount of compensation expense is based upon current performance projections for each threeyear period and the percentage of the requisite service that has been rendered the calculation is also based upon the grant date fair value determined using a blackscholes model payouts are recorded as capital in excess of stated value in shareholders’ equity the amount recorded at october 31 2010 for the plans originating in 2008 2009 and 2010 was 3879 

 

compensation expense attributable to all ltip performance periods for executive officers and selected other employees for 2010 and 2008 was 3879 and 4762 respectively there was 5014 credited to expense attributable to all ltip performance periods for executive officers and selected other employees for 2009 due to economic effects 

2010 and 2009 

sales  — worldwide sales for 2010 were 1041551 an increase of 271 percent from 2009 sales of 819165 sales volume increased 255 percent and favorable currency effects caused by the weaker us dollar increased sales by 16 percent 

 

as used throughout this form 10k geographic regions include the americas canada mexico and central and south america asia pacific excludes japan europe japan and the united states 

 

sales of the adhesive dispensing systems segment were 525290 in 2010 an increase of 64544 or 140 percent from 2009 sales of 460746 the increase was the result of a sales volume increase of 120 percent and favorable currency effects that increased sales by 20 percent sales volume increased in all geographic regions and was particularly strong in asia pacific 

 

sales of the advanced technology systems segment were 380304 in 2010 an increase of 131477 or 528 percent from 2009 sales of 248827 the increase was the result of a sales volume increase of 522 percent and favorable currency effects that increased sales by 06 percent within the segment significant volume increases occurred in all geographic regions and were most pronounced in asia pacific due to higher demand in consumer electronics end markets 

 

current year sales of the industrial coating systems segment were 135957 an increase of 26365 or 241 percent from prior year sales of 109592 the increase was the result of a sales volume increase of 222 percent and favorable currency effects that increased sales by 19 percent sales volume which increased in all geographic regions except japan was most pronounced in asia pacific 

 

sales outside the united states accounted for 734 percent of our sales in 2010 up from 713 percent last year sales increased in all five geographic regions in which we operate in asia pacific sales were 253460 in 2010 an increase of 735 percent from 2009 sales volume increased 704 percent and favorable currency effects added 31 percent in the americas sales were 77592 up 295 percent from the prior year sales volume increased 218 percent and favorable currency effects increased sales by 77 percent in the united states sales were 277262 in 2010 an increase of 178 percent from 2009 in japan sales were 95789 up 169 percent from 2009 sales volume increased 110 percent and favorable currency effects added 59 percent in europe sales were 337448 in 2010 an increase of 140 percent from 2009 sales volume increased 144 percent and unfavorable currency effects reduced sales by 04 percent 

 

it is estimated that the effect of pricing on total revenue was neutral relative to the prior year 

 

operating profit  — cost of sales in 2010 were 419937 up 199 percent from 2009 the increase compared to the prior year is due to increased sales volume but produced more favorable margins gross margins expressed as a percentage of sales increased to 597 percent in 2010 from 572 percent in 2009 the gross margin percentage increase in the current year was due to higher absorption of fixed overhead costs the impact of cost reduction activities taken in 2009 more profitable product line mix and favorable currency effects 

 

selling and administrative expenses excluding severance and restructuring costs were 384752 in 2010 an increase of 47458 or 141 percent from 2009 the increase was largely due to higher incentive compensation expenses resulting from a higher level of business activity in the current year in addition currency translation effects increased selling and administrative costs by 15 percent selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to 369 percent in 2010 from 412 percent in 2009 due to the higher level of sales and the favorable effects of restructuring activities 

 

on june 30 2010 we sold our graphic arts and lamps product lines to baldwin technology company inc these product lines were reported in the advanced technology systems segment we recognized a pretax loss on disposition of 357 which is reflected in selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of income results of operations and net assets of the divested product lines were immaterial to our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in september 2008 a cost reduction program that involved a combination of nonworkforce related efficiencies and workforce reductions primarily in the united states and europe was announced in response to the continuing economic crisis additional cost reduction actions were taken in 2009 and 2010 total severance and related costs of these actions were 5561 in 2008 and 16396 in 2009 and 2029 in 2010 severance costs were recorded in the corporate segment 

 

in 2009 we recognized goodwill and longlived asset impairment charges of 243043 of this amount 232789 related to goodwill 8282 related to indefinite lived trade name assets and 1972 related to other longlived assets additional information regarding these charges is described in the critical accounting policies and estimates section 

 

operating profit as a percent of sales was 225 percent in 2010 compared to negative 156 percent in 2009 goodwill and longlived impairment charges accounted for 297 percent of the 381 percent change the remainder of the change was primarily due to sales mix yielding higher gross margins effects of cost reduction activities taken in 2008 and 2009 that resulted in operating costs increasing at a slower rate than sales and higher severance and restructuring costs in 2009 

 

segment operating profit margins in 2010 and 2009 were as follows 

 

 

 

operating capacity for each of our segments can support fluctuations in order activity without significant changes in operating costs also currency translation affects reported operating profit margins operating margins for each segment were favorably impacted by a weaker dollar during the year as compared to the prior year 

 

operating profit as a percent of sales for the adhesive dispensing systems segment increased to 317 percent in 2010 from 277 percent in 2009 the increase was primarily due to higher gross margin percentages and to sales volume increasing at a higher rate than selling and administrative expenses 

 

operating profit as a percent of sales for the advanced technology systems segment was 227 percent in 2010 compared to an operating loss of 862 percent of sales in 2009 the change was due primarily to goodwill and longlived asset impairment charges of 239427 in the prior year excluding these impairment charges operating margin was 101 percent the increase from 101 percent to 227 percent was primarily due to sales volume increasing at a higher rate than selling and administrative expenses 

 

operating profit as a percent of sales for the industrial coating systems segment was 92 percent in 2010 compared to an operating loss of 67 percent of sales in 2009 the prior year included a goodwill impairment charge of 3616 excluding this charge operating margin was negative 34 percent in 2009 the profitability improvement in 2010 was primarily due to higher gross margin percentages and to sales volume increasing at a higher rate than selling and administrative expenses 

 

interest and other income expense  — interest expense in 2010 was 6263 a decrease of 1508 or 194 percent from 2009 the decrease was primarily due to lower borrowing levels in the current year interest income was 819 in 2010 up from 492 in 2009 the increase was primarily due to a higher level of shortterm investments in the current year other income in 2010 was 1930 compared to 7895 in 2009 included in these amounts were foreign currency gains of 1221 in 2010 and 1571 in 2009 the prior year also included a 5011 gain on the sale of real estate in westlake ohio 

 

income taxes  — income tax expense in 2010 was 63271 or 274 percent of pretax income income tax expense in 2009 was 32864 most of the goodwill and longlived asset impairment charges recorded in 2009 were not deductible for income tax purposes 

 

the 2010 effective tax rate was positively impacted by a tax benefit of 10243 from the writeoff of the tax basis in our uv graphics arts and lamps product lines the current year tax rate was also positively impacted by consolidation of certain operations and legal entities resulting in a 3616 tax benefit and by the utilization of foreign operating tax loss carryforwards 

the 2010 effective rate was impacted by an additional tax charge of 5249 resulting from the enactment of the patient protection and affordable care act and the subsequent enactment of the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 this charge was due to a reduction in the value of a deferred tax asset as a result of a change to the tax treatment associated with medicare part d subsidies 

 

net income loss  — net income was 168048 or 491 per diluted share in 2010 this compares to a net loss of 160055 or 477 per diluted share in 2009 

 

recently issued accounting standards  — in september 2006 the fasb issued a standard regarding fair value measurements this standard provides a common definition of fair value and establishes a framework to make the measurement of fair value in generally accepted accounting principles more consistent and comparable it also requires expanded disclosures to provide information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities the methods and assumptions used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measures on earnings in february 2008 the fasb issued an update that permitted a oneyear deferral of the original standard for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually we adopted the nondeferred portion of the standard as of november 1 2008 and the deferred portion of the standard as of november 1 2009 the adoptions did not impact our results of operations or financial position 

 

in december 2007 the fasb issued a standard that provides greater consistency in the accounting and financial reporting of business combinations the standard requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction establishes the acquisitiondate fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed and requires the acquirer to disclose the nature and financial effect of the business combination we adopted this standard as of november 1 2009 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position the future impact will depend on the nature and significance of future acquisitions 

 

in december 2007 the fasb issued a pronouncement that establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary we adopted this pronouncement as of november 1 2009 the impact of adoption will depend on future transactions to date there was no impact of the adoption on our results of operations or financial position 

 

in december 2008 the fasb issued a standard that enhances the required disclosures about plan assets in an employer’s defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan including investment allocations decisions inputs and valuations techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets and significant concentrations of risks within plan assets we adopted this standard as of october 31 2010 and the required disclosures are contained in note 3 

 

in october 2009 the fasb issued authoritative guidance on multipledeliverable revenue arrangements that addresses the unit of accounting for arrangements involving multiple deliverables the guidance also addresses how arrangement consideration should be allocated to separate units of accounting when applicable and expands the disclosure requirements for multipledeliverable arrangements we must adopt this standard in 2011 the adoption is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 

 

2009 and 2008 

sales  — as a result of the global economic slowdown worldwide sales for 2009 were 819165 a decrease of 272 percent from 2008 sales of 1124829 sales volume decreased 233 percent and unfavorable currency translation effects caused by the stronger united states dollar decreased sales by an additional 39 percent over the prior year 

 

sales of the adhesive dispensing systems segment were 460746 in 2009 a decrease of 119965 or 207 percent from 2008 the change was the result of a sales volume decrease of 163 percent and unfavorable currency translation effects that reduced sales by an additional 44 percent the sales decrease was largely attributable to largedollar system product lines with sales to consumer nondurable end markets such as packaging and nonwovens remaining more stable all product lines within this segment and all geographic regions experienced sales volume decreases from the prior year 

sales of the advanced technology systems segment were 248827 in 2009 a decrease of 118539 or 323 percent from 2008 sales volume decreased 282 percent and unfavorable currency translation effects decreased sales by 41 percent within the segment volume decreases occurred in all product lines and all geographic regions largely due to reduced demand in semiconductor and consumer electronics end markets 

 

industrial coating systems segment sales in 2009 were 109592 a decrease of 67160 or 380 percent from the prior year the decrease was the result of a sales volume decrease of 359 percent and unfavorable currency translation effects of 21 percent the sales volume decline was largely due to the lack of capital spending in consumer durable end markets within the segment volume decreases occurred in all product lines and all geographic regions 

 

sales outside the united states accounted for 713 percent of total 2009 sales compared to 719 percent in 2008 sales volume in 2009 decreased from the prior year in all five geographic regions in which we operate sales volume was down 316 percent in japan 254 percent in the united states 229 percent in europe 193 percent in asia pacific and 140 percent in the americas sales in all international regions except japan were negatively impacted by the stronger us dollar 

 

it is estimated that the effect of pricing on total revenue was neutral relative to the prior year 

 

operating profit  — cost of sales in 2009 was 350239 down 292 percent from 2008 due primarily to the decrease in sales volume currency effects reduced cost of sales by 28 percent gross margins expressed as a percent of sales increased to 572 percent in 2009 from 560 percent in 2008 the increase was due primarily to a higher mix of consumables and aftermarket part sales compared to engineered systems sales the gross margin percentage was also impacted by a reduction of overhead costs related to initiatives to reduce spending in response to the economic slowdown 

 

selling and administrative expenses excluding severance and restructuring costs were 337294 in 2009 a decrease of 97182 or 224 percent from 2008 the decrease was largely due to reduced compensation expenses associated with lower employment levels furloughs lower incentive compensation expense and tightened control over discretionary spending in addition currency translation effects decreased selling and administrative costs by 42 percent selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 412 percent in 2009 from 386 percent in 2008 due to the lower level of sales 

 

in september 2008 a cost reduction program that involved a combination of nonworkforce related efficiencies and workforce reductions primarily in the united states and europe was announced in response to the continuing economic crisis additional cost reduction actions were taken in 2009 the total severance and related costs of these actions were 5561 in 2008 and 16396 in 2009 severance costs were recorded in the corporate segment 

 

in 2009 we recognized goodwill and longlived asset impairment charges of 243043 of this amount 232789 related to goodwill 8282 related to indefinite lived trade name assets and 1972 related to other longlived assets additional information regarding these charges is described in the critical accounting policies and estimates section 

 

operating margin was negative 156 percent in 2009 compared to operating profit of 169 percent in 2008 goodwill and longlived impairment charges accounted for 297 percent of the 325 percent change the remainder of the decrease was due primarily to the reduction in sales volume 

 

segment operating profit margins in 2009 and 2008 were as follows 

 

 

 

operating capacity for each of our segments can support fluctuations in order activity without significant changes in operating costs also currency translation affects reported operating profit margins operating margins for each segment were unfavorably impacted by a stronger dollar during the year as compared to the prior year 

operating margin for the adhesive dispensing systems segment was 277 percent up from 250 percent in 2008 the increase was due primarily to a higher gross margin percentage resulting from a mix of more consumables and aftermarket part sales compared to engineered systems sales in 2009 

 

operating margin for the advanced technology systems segment was negative 862 percent in 2009 as compared to an operating profit margin of 168 percent in 2008 the change was due primarily to goodwill and longlived asset impairment and charges of 239427 excluding these impairment charges operating margin was 101 percent in 2009 the decrease from the prior year was due primarily to sales volume decreasing at a higher rate than both cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses 

 

operating margin for the industrial coating systems segment was negative 67 percent in 2009 as compared to an operating profit margin of 62 percent in 2008 the current year included a goodwill impairment charge of 3616 excluding this charge operating margin was negative 34 percent the change from 2008 was due primarily to sales volume decreasing at a higher rate than selling and administrative expenses 

 

interest and other income expense  — interest expense in 2009 was 7771 a decrease of 8943 or 535 percent from 2008 due to lower borrowing levels and lower interest rates other income was 7895 in 2009 compared to 4914 in 2008 included in other income expense were currency gains of 1571 in 2009 and 2153 in 2008 a 5011 gain on the sale of real estate in westlake ohio was included in 2009 other income 

 

income taxes  — income tax expense was 32864 in 2009 most of the goodwill and longlived asset impairment charges in 2009 were nondeductible for income tax purposes income tax expense for 2008 was 62284 

 

net income loss  — net loss was 160055 or 477 per diluted share in 2009 this compares to net income of 117504 or 343 per diluted share in 2008 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash provided by operations in 2010 was 140186 compared to 168677 in 2009 the primary sources were net income loss noncash items and the tax benefit from the exercise of stock options totaling 213756 compared to 138529 in 2009 operating assets and liabilities used 73570 of cash in 2010 compared to 2009 when operating assets and liabilities generated 30148 of cash the primary reasons for the change were a higher level of business activity resulting in higher operating assets and onetime postretirement payments and cash contributions to us pension plans in 2010 totaling 79514 

 

cash used by investing activities was 41324 in 2010 compared to 3939 in 2009 capital expenditures were 14317 in 2010 up from 12514 in the prior year significant capital expenditures in 2010 included construction of our new corporate headquarters facility to replace the facility sold in 2009 continuing rollout of sap enterprise management software and various projects that improve manufacturing and distribution in 2009 proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment were 8611 and primarily consisted of the sale of our westlake ohio corporate headquarters building and a portion of the real property surrounding the building in 2010 the acquisition of glt used 18576 of cash and cash of 7795 was used to purchase marketable securities primarily bank certificates of deposit 

 

cash of 79275 was used for financing activities in 2010 compared to 161018 in 2009 the current year included net repayments of 45135 of short and longterm borrowings compared to 127268 in the prior year issuance of common shares related to employee benefit plans generated 13828 of cash in 2010 up from 2986 in 2009 and the tax benefit from stock option exercises was 7798 in the current year up from 284 in the prior year these increases were the result of more stock option exercises due to the higher price of our common stock purchases of treasury shares used 24935 of cash in 2010 up from 7115 in 2009 as we focused on repayment of debt in the prior year dividend payments were 26439 in 2010 up from 24747 in 2009 due to an increase in the annual dividend to 078 per share from 07375 per share 

the following is a summary of significant changes by balance sheet caption from october 31 2009 to october 31 2010 receivables inventories and accounts payable increased due primarily to higher level of business activity in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 prepaid expenses decreased primarily due to the sale of the uv curing graphic arts and lamps product lines in 2010 goodwill increased primarily due to the purchase of glt in 2010 longterm deferred income taxes changed from a net asset position of 18119 at the end of 2009 to a net liability position of 9745 at the end of 2010 the primary reasons for the change were the acceleration of a tax deduction related to a pension contribution made in 2010 and a change to the tax treatment associated with medicare part d subsidies the increase in other longterm assets is largely due to a longterm receivable associated with the sale of uv curing graphic arts and lamps product lines and increases in pension assets and in the market value of assets held in a rabbi trust that serves as an investment to shadow our deferred compensation plan liability the increase in income taxes payable is largely due to a higher profitability level in 2010 the increase in accrued liabilities is primarily due to accruals for salaries and incentive compensation offset by payments of supplemental pension and deferred compensation liabilities current maturities of longterm debt increased due to scheduled repayments of senior notes the decrease in longterm pension and retirement obligations is the result of the pension plan contributions referred to above partially offset by the effects of lower discount rates 

 

on december 10 2008 the board of directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to 1000 shares uses for repurchased shares include the funding of benefit programs including stock options nonvested stock and 401k matching during 2010 we repurchased 348 shares authorized to be repurchased under this program 

 

the following table summarizes contractual obligations as of october 31 2010 

 

 

 

1 we have a 400000 unsecured multicurrency credit facility with a group of banks that expires in 2012 and may be increased to 500000 under certain conditions at october 31 2010 46000 was outstanding under this facility compared to 88000 outstanding at october 31 2009 there are two primary financial covenants that must be met under this facility the first covenant limits the amount of total indebtedness that can be incurred to 35 times consolidated trailing ebitda both indebtedness and ebitda as defined in the credit agreement the second covenant requires consolidated trailing ebitda to be at least three times consolidated trailing interest expense both as defined in the credit agreement at october 31 2010 we were in compliance with all debt covenants and the amount we could borrow under the credit facility would not have been limited by any debt covenants 

in 2008 we entered into a note purchase and private shelf agreement the agreement with prudential investment management inc the agreement consists of a 50000 senior note and a 100000 private shelf facility the senior note bears interest at a rate of 498 percent and matures on february 22 2013 the agreement also contains customary events of default and covenants related to limitations on indebtedness and the maintenance of certain financial ratios we were in compliance with all covenants at october 31 2010 under the private shelf facility we may also borrow during the next three years up to 100000 at interest rates in effect at the time of borrowing borrowings can be for up to 12 years with an average life not to exceed 10 years at october 31 2010 the amount we could borrow under the private shelf facility would not have been limited by any debt covenants 

 

see note 8 for additional information 

 

2 see note 6 for additional information 

 

3 we have various lines of credit with foreign banks totaling 39710 of which 37550 was unused at october 31 2010 see note 7 for additional information 

 

4 pension and postretirement plan funding amounts after 2011 will be determined based on the future funded status of the plans and therefore cannot be estimated at this time see note 3 for additional information 

 

5 purchase obligations primarily represent commitments for materials used in our manufacturing processes that are not recorded in our consolidated balance sheet 

 

we believe that the combination of present capital resources internally generated funds and unused financing sources are more than adequate to meet cash requirements for 2011 there are no significant restrictions limiting the transfer of funds from international subsidiaries to the parent company 

 

outlook 

our operating performance in 2010 rebounded from 2009 which was affected by disruptions in global financial markets and the general economic environment going forward we are well positioned to manage our liquidity our liquidity needs arise from working capital requirements capital expenditures and principal and interest payments on indebtedness primary sources of capital to meet these needs are cash provided by operations and borrowings under our loan agreements in 2010 cash from operations was 13 percent of revenue including voluntary contributions to our us pension plans and onetime postretirement payments representing 8 percent of revenue compared to 20 percent in 2009 comparatively during the 2001 and 2002 recession years cash from operations were 10 percent and 20 percent respectively and then ranged from 10 percent to 14 percent in subsequent years until 2009 funds provided by borrowings occur under a 400000 fiveyear committed revolving line of credit with a group of domestic and international banks that expires in 2012 as of october 31 2010 we were in compliance with the financial covenant of this credit facility and have 354000 available borrowing capacity in addition in february 2008 we entered into a 100000 master shelf arrangement with the prudential insurance company to allow for the issuance of medium to longterm unsecured notes as of october 31 2010 we are in compliance with the financial covenant relating to a 50000 fiveyear note issued under this arrangement while these facilities provide the contractual terms for any borrowing we cannot be assured that these facilities would be available in the event that these financial institutions failed to remain sufficiently capitalized 

following the rebound in 2010 we move forward with caution in our approach to 2011 our priorities for 2011 are focused on maintaining operational improvements achieved over the past two years through a combination of nonworkforce related efficiencies and workforce reductions we will continue to utilize lean concepts within our operations we expect these efforts will provide sufficient cash from operations to meet our liquidity needs as well as enable us to invest in the development of new applications and markets for our technologies and pursue strategic acquisition opportunities with respect to spending the table above presents our financial obligations as 197314 of which 76199 is payable in 2011 on december 10 2008 our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to 1000 shares under this authorization the timing and actual number of shares subject to repurchase are at the discretion of management and are contingent on a number of factors including levels of cash generation from operations cash requirements for acquisitions repayment of debt and our share price capital expenditures for 2011 will be focused primarily upon our inprocess rollout of sap and various facility projects that improve manufacturing and distribution 

 

effects of foreign currency 

the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on sales and operating results cannot be precisely measured due to fluctuating selling prices sales volume product mix and cost structures in each country where we operate as a general rule a weakening of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies has a favorable effect on sales and net income while a strengthening of the dollar has a detrimental effect 

 

in 2010 as compared with 2009 the united states dollar was generally weaker against foreign currencies if 2009 exchange rates had been in effect during 2010 sales would have been approximately 12944 lower and thirdparty costs would have been approximately 5208 lower in 2009 as compared with 2008 the united states dollar was generally stronger against foreign currencies if 2008 exchange rates had been in effect during 2009 sales would have been approximately 43952 higher and thirdparty costs would have been approximately 31898 higher these effects on reported sales do not include the impact of local price adjustments made in response to changes in currency exchange rates 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

we operate internationally and enter into intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies consequently we are subject to market risk arising from exchange rate movements between the dates foreign currencies are recorded and the dates they are settled we regularly use foreign exchange contracts to reduce our risks related to most of these transactions these contracts primarily associated with the euro yen and british pound typically have maturities of 90 days or less and generally require the exchange of foreign currencies for united states dollars at rates stated in the contracts gains and losses from changes in the market value of these contracts offset foreign exchange losses and gains respectively on the underlying transactions other transactions denominated in foreign currencies are designated as hedges of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries or are intercompany transactions of a longterm investment nature as a result of the use of foreign exchange contracts on a routine basis to reduce the risks related to most of our transactions denominated in foreign currencies as of october 31 2010 we did not have material foreign currency exposure 

 

note 9 to the financial statements contains additional information about our foreign currency transactions and the methods and assumptions used to record these transactions 

 

a portion of our operations is financed with shortterm and longterm borrowings and is subject to market risk arising from changes in interest rates 

the tables that follow present principal repayments and related weightedaverage interest rates by expected maturity dates of fixedrate debt 

 

at october 31 2010 

 

 

we also have variablerate notes payable and longterm debt the weighted average interest rate of this debt was 07 percent at october 31 2010 and 06 percent at october 31 2009 a one percent increase in interest rates would have resulted in additional interest expense of approximately 1073 on the variable rate notes payable and longterm debt in 2010 

 

inflation 

inflation affects profit margins as the ability to pass cost increases on to customers is restricted by the need for competitive pricing although inflation has been modest in recent years and has had no material effect on the years covered by these financial statements we continue to seek ways to minimize the impact of inflation through focused efforts to increase productivity 

 

trends 

the fiveyear summary in item 6 documents our historical financial trends over this period the world’s economic conditions fluctuated significantly our solid performance is attributed to our participation in diverse geographic and industrial markets and our longterm commitment to develop and provide quality products and worldwide service to meet our customers’ changing needs

financial information about operating segments foreign and domestic operations and export sales 

in accordance with accounting standards we have reported information about our three operating segments this information is contained in note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements which can be found in part ii item 8 of this document 

 

principal products and uses 

we are one of the world’s leading manufacturers of equipment used for precision dispensing testing and inspection surface preparation and curing our technologybased systems can be found in production facilities around the world equipment ranges from manual standalone units for lowvolume operations to microprocessorbased automated systems for highspeed highvolume production lines 

 

we market our products in the united states and in more than 50 other countries primarily through a direct sales force and also through qualified distributors and sales representatives we have built a worldwide reputation for creativity and expertise in the design and engineering of hightechnology application equipment that meets the specific needs of our customers 

 

the following is a summary of the products and markets served by our operating segments 

 

  

this segment delivers our proprietary precision dispensing technology to diverse markets for applications that commonly reduce material consumption increase line efficiency and enhance product strength durability brand and appearance

manufacturing and raw materials 

our production operations include machining and assembly we manufacture specially designed parts and assemble components into finished equipment many components are made in standard modules that can be used in more than one product or in combination with other components for a variety of models we have principal manufacturing operations in the united states in amherst ohio norcross swainsboro and dawsonville georgia carlsbad california robbinsville new jersey and east providence rhode island as well as in shanghai and suzhou china luneburg germany bangalore india maastricht the netherlands and in aylesbury and slough united kingdom 

 

principal materials used to make our products are metals and plastics typically in sheets bar stock castings forgings and tubing we also purchase many electrical and electronic components fabricated metal parts highpressure fluid hoses packings seals and other items integral to our products suppliers are competitively selected based on cost quality and service all significant raw materials that we use are available through multiple sources 

 

senior operating executives supervise an extensive quality control program for our equipment machinery and systems 

 

natural gas and other fuels are our primary energy sources however standby capacity for alternative sources is available if needed 

 

intellectual property 

we maintain procedures to protect our intellectual property including patents trademarks and copyrights both domestically and internationally risk factors associated with our intellectual property are discussed in item 1a risk factors 

 

seasonal variation in business 

generally the highest volume of sales occurs in our fourth fiscal quarter due in large part to the timing of customers’ capital spending programs first quarter sales volume is typically the lowest of the year due to customer holiday shutdowns 

 

working capital practices 

no special or unusual practices affect our working capital however we generally require advance payments as deposits on customized equipment and systems and in certain cases require progress payments during the manufacturing of these products we have initiated a number of new processes focused on reduction of manufacturing lead times these initiatives have resulted in lower investment in inventory while maintaining the capability to respond promptly to customer needs 

 

customers 

we serve a broad customer base both in terms of industries and geographic regions in fiscal year 2009 no single customer accounted for five percent or more of sales 

 

backlog 

our backlog of open orders decreased to approximately 79000 at october 31 2009 from approximately 82000 at october 31 2008 the decrease can be traced primarily to the industrial coating systems segment partially offset by favorable effects of changes in currency rates all orders in the fiscal 2009 yearend backlog are expected to be shipped to customers in fiscal year 2010 

 

government contracts 

our business neither includes nor depends upon a significant amount of governmental contracts or subcontracts therefore no material part of our business is subject to renegotiation or termination at the option of the government 

 

competitive conditions 

our equipment is sold in competition with a wide variety of alternative bonding sealing caulking finishing coating testing and inspection techniques any production process that requires surface preparation or modification application of material to a substrate or surface curing or testing and inspection is a potential use for our equipment 

 

many factors influence our competitive position including pricing product quality and service we enjoy a leadership position in our business segments by delivering highquality innovative products and technologies as well as afterthesale service and technical support working with customers to understand their processes and developing the application solutions that help them meet their production requirements also contributes to our leadership position our worldwide network of direct sales and technical resources also is a competitive advantage 

 

research and development 

investments in research and development are important to our longterm growth enabling us to keep pace with changing customer and marketplace needs through the development of new products and new applications for existing products we place strong emphasis on technology developments and improvements through internal engineering and research teams research and development expenses were approximately 25528 in fiscal year 2009 compared with approximately 33566 in fiscal year 2008 and 35432 in fiscal year 2007 

 

environmental compliance 

we are subject to extensive federal state local and foreign environmental safety and health laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to land and water and the generation handling treatment and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials under certain of these laws we can be held strictly liable for hazardous substance contamination of any real property we have ever owned operated or used as a disposal site or for natural resource damages associated with such contamination we are also required to maintain various related permits and licenses many of which require periodic modification and renewal the operation of manufacturing plants unavoidably entails environmental safety and health risks and we could incur material unanticipated costs or liabilities in the future if any of these risks were realized in ways or to an extent that we did not anticipate 

we believe that we operate in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations compliance with environmental laws and regulations requires continuing management effort and expenditures we have incurred and will continue to incur costs and capital expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations and to obtain and maintain the necessary permits and licenses we believe that the cost of complying with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material affect on our earnings liquidity or competitive position but cannot assure that material compliancerelated costs and expenses may not arise in the future for example future adoption of new or amended environmental laws regulations or requirements or newly discovered contamination or other circumstances that require us to incur costs and expenses that cannot be presently anticipated 

 

we believe that policies practices and procedures have been properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of material environmental damage arising from our operations we accrue for estimated environmental liabilities with charges to expense and believe our environmental accrual is adequate to provide for our portion of the costs of all such known environmental liabilities compliance with federal state and local environmental protection laws during fiscal year 2009 had no material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position based upon consideration of currently available information we believe liabilities for environmental matters will not have a material adverse affect on our financial position operating results or liquidity but we cannot assure that material environmental liabilities may not arise in the future 

 

employees 

as of october 31 2009 we had 3681 full and parttime employees including 112 at our amherst ohio facility who are represented by a collective bargaining agreement that expires on october 31 2010 no material work stoppages have been experienced at any of our facilities during any of the periods covered by this report

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

in an enterprise as diverse as ours a wide range of factors could affect future performance we discuss in this section some of the risk factors that if they actually occurred could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition value and results of operations you should consider these risk factors in connection with evaluating the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k because these factors could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected in forwardlooking statements the risks that we highlight below are not the only ones that we face additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know about or that we currently believe will be immaterial may also affect our business 

 

the significant risk factors affecting our operations include the following 

 

changes in united states or international economic conditions could adversely affect the profitability of any of our operations 

in fiscal year 2009 29 percent of our revenue was derived from domestic customers while 71 percent was derived from international customers our largest markets include appliance automotive bookbinding construction container converting electronics assembly food and beverage furniture life sciences medical metal finishing nonwovens packaging and semiconductor a slowdown in any of these specific end markets could directly affect our revenue stream and profitability 

a portion of our product sales is attributable to industries and markets such as the semiconductor and metal finishing industries which historically have been cyclical and sensitive to relative changes in supply and demand and general economic conditions the demand for our products depends in part on the general economic conditions of the industries or national economies of our customers downward economic cycles in our customers’ industries or countries may reduce sales of some of our products it is not possible to predict accurately the factors that will affect demand for our products in the future 

 

any significant downturn in the health of the general economy either globally regionally or in the markets in which we sell products could have an adverse effect on our revenues and financial performance resulting in impairment of assets 

 

significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates or change in monetary policy may harm our financial results 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly with respect to the euro the yen and the british pound any significant change in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business against the united states dollar could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for additional detail related to this risk see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

 

the majority of our consolidated revenues in fiscal year 2009 were generated in currencies other than the united states dollar which is our reporting currency we recognize foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from our operations in the period incurred as a result currency fluctuations between the united states dollar and the currencies in which we do business have caused and will continue to cause foreign currency transaction and translation gains and losses which historically have been material and could continue to be material we cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future operating results because of the number of currencies involved the variability of currency exposures and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates we take actions to manage our foreign currency exposure such as entering into hedging transactions where available but we cannot assure that our strategies will adequately protect our consolidated operating results from the effects of exchange rate fluctuations 

 

we also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into united states dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or customers located in or conducting business in a country imposing controls currency devaluations diminish the united states dollar value of the currency of the country instituting the devaluation and if they occur or continue for significant periods could adversely affect our earnings or cash flow 

 

we could be adversely affected by rapid changes in interest rates 

any period of unexpected or rapid increase in interest rates may also adversely affect our profitability at october 31 2009 we had 157837 of total debt outstanding of which approximately 57 percent was priced at interest rates that float with the market a one percent increase in the interest rate on the floating rate debt in fiscal year 2009 would have resulted in approximately 1661 of additional interest expense a higher level of floating rate debt would increase the exposure discussed above for additional detail related to this risk see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

inability to access capital could impede growth or the repayment or refinancing of existing indebtedness 

the limits imposed on us by the restrictive covenants contained in our credit facilities could prevent us from making acquisitions or cause us to lose access to these facilities 

 

our existing credit facilities contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to among other things 

 

  

in addition our credit facilities require us to meet financial ratios including total indebtedness to consolidated trailing ebitda both as defined in the credit facility and consolidated trailing ebitda to consolidated trailing interest expense as defined in the credit facility 

 

these restrictions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs and could otherwise restrict our financing activities 

 

our ability to comply with the covenants and other terms of our credit facilities will depend on our future operating performance if we fail to comply with such covenants and terms we will be in default and the maturity of the related debt could be accelerated and become immediately due and payable we may be required to obtain waivers from our lenders in order to maintain compliance under our credit facilities including waivers with respect to our compliance with certain financial covenants if we are unable to obtain necessary waivers and the debt under our credit facilities is accelerated we would be required to obtain replacement financing at prevailing market rates 

 

we may need new or additional financing in the future to expand our business or refinance existing indebtedness if we are unable to access capital on satisfactory terms and conditions we may not be able to expand our business or meet our payment requirements under our existing credit facilities our ability to obtain new or additional financing will depend on a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control we may not be able to obtain new or additional financing because we have substantial debt or because we may not have sufficient cash flow to service or repay our existing or future debt in addition depending on market conditions and our financial performance neither debt nor equity financing may be available on satisfactory terms or at all finally as a consequence of worsening financial market conditions our credit facility providers may not provide the agreed capital if they become undercapitalized 

 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions and we may not be able to make acquisitions of suitable candidates or integrate acquisitions successfully 

our recent historical growth has depended and our future growth is likely to continue to depend in part on our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses into our existing operations we intend to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world we cannot assure however that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates prevail against competing potential acquirers negotiate appropriate acquisition terms obtain financing that may be needed to consummate such acquisitions complete proposed acquisitions successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new markets in addition we cannot assure that any acquisition once successfully integrated will perform as planned be accretive to earnings or prove to be beneficial to our operations and cash flow 

the success of any acquisition is subject to other risks and uncertainties including 

 

  

in addition an acquisition could adversely impact our operating performance as a result of the incurrence of acquisitionrelated debt acquisition expenses or the amortization of acquisitionacquired assets 

 

we may also face liability with respect to acquired businesses for violations of environmental laws occurring prior to the date of our acquisition and some or all of these liabilities may not be covered by environmental insurance secured to mitigate the risk or by indemnification from the sellers from which we acquired these businesses we could also incur significant costs including but not limited to remediation costs natural resources damages civil or criminal fines and sanctions and thirdparty claims as a result of past or future violations of or liabilities associated with environmental laws 

 

the inability to continue to develop new products could limit our revenue and profitability 

innovation is critical to our success we believe that we must continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and manufacture new products with improved capabilities in order to continue to be a market leader we also believe that we must continue to make improvements in our productivity in order to maintain our competitive position our inability to anticipate respond to or utilize changing technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated results of operations 

 

our inability to protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect product sales and financial performance 

difficulties in acquiring and maintaining our intellectual property rights could also adversely affect our business and financial position our performance may depend in part on our ability to establish protect and enforce intellectual property rights with respect to our patented technologies and proprietary rights and to defend against any claims of infringement these activities involve complex and constantly evolving legal scientific and factual questions and uncertainties our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends in part on our ability to maintain and enforce our patents and other proprietary rights which are essential to our business these measures afford only limited protection and may not in all cases prevent our competitors from gaining access to our intellectual property and proprietary information 

litigation has been and may continue to be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets and to determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights in addition we may face claims of infringement that could interfere with our ability to use technology or other intellectual property rights that are material to our business operations if litigation that we initiate is unsuccessful we may not be able to protect the value of some of our intellectual property if a claim of infringement against us is successful we may be required to pay royalties or license fees to continue to use technology or other intellectual property rights that we have been using or we may be unable to obtain necessary licenses from third parties at a reasonable cost or within a reasonable time if we are unable to timely obtain licenses on reasonable terms we may be forced to cease selling or using any of our products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property or to redesign or in the case of trademark claims rename our products to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties this may not always be possible or if possible may be time consuming and expensive intellectual property litigation whether successful or unsuccessful could be expensive to us and divert some of our resources our intellectual property rights may not be as valuable as we believe which could result in a competitive disadvantage or adversely affect our business and financial performance 

 

political conditions in foreign countries in which we operate could adversely affect us 

we conduct our manufacturing sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and are subject to risks associated with doing business outside the united states in fiscal year 2009 approximately 71 percent of our total sales were to customers outside the united states we expect that international operations and united states export sales will continue to be important to our business for the foreseeable future both the sales from international operations and export sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside the united states such risks include but are not limited to the following 

 

  

any of these events could reduce the demand for our products limit the prices at which we can sell our products or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operating performance

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend  

we are involved in pending or potential litigation regarding environmental product liability patent contract employee and other matters arising from the normal course of business including the environmental matter discussed below it is our opinion after consultation with legal counsel that resolutions of these matters are not expected to result in a material effect on our financial condition quarterly or annual operating results or cash flows 

 

environmental — we have voluntarily agreed with the city of new richmond wisconsin and other potentially responsible parties prps to share costs associated with the remediation of the city of new richmond municipal landfill the “site” and constructing a potable water delivery system serving the impacted area down gradient of the site 

 

the feasibility study  remedial investigation for this project was completed and approved by the wisconsin department of natural resources wdnr in september 2006 in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 the prps signed an environmental repair contract with the wdnr at that time the estimated cost to us for site remediation constructing a potable water delivery system and ongoing operation maintenance and monitoring omm at the site and the impacted area down gradient of the site over the statutory monitoring period of 30 years was 3008 at october 31 2007 1858 was recorded in other current liabilities with the remaining amount of 1150 classified as longterm during fiscal year 2008 1858 was paid in fulfillment of our obligation to fund a portion of the estimated cost of site remediation construction of the potable water delivery system and one year of omm during fiscal year 2009 an additional payment of 265 was made leaving a balance for the remaining omm obligation of 885 this amount was reported in other longterm liabilities at october 31 2009 

 

during fiscal year 2008 agreements were reached with seven insurance companies that resulted in reimbursement to us of 1863 for costs related to this remediation project 

 

the liability for environmental remediation represents management’s best estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable undiscounted costs related to known remediation obligations the accuracy of our estimate of environmental liability is affected by several uncertainties such as additional requirements that may be identified in connection with remedial activities the complexity and evolution of environmental laws and regulations and the identification of presently unknown remediation requirements consequently our liability could be greater than our current estimate however we do not expect that the costs associated with remediation will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses on an ongoing basis we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that are used to prepare financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates used by management 

 

certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below on a regular basis critical accounting policies are reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 

 

revenue recognition  — most of our revenues are recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the sales price is fixed or determinable collectibility is reasonably assured and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer revenues from contracts with multiple element arrangements such as those including installation or other services are recognized as each element is earned based on objective evidence of the relative fair value of each element if the installation or other services are inconsequential to the functionality of the delivered product the entire amount of revenue is recognized upon satisfaction of the criteria noted above inconsequential installation or other services are those that can generally be completed in a short period of time at insignificant cost and the skills required to complete these installations are not unique to us if installation or other services are essential to the functionality of the delivered product revenues attributable to these obligations are deferred until completed amounts received in excess of revenue recognized are included as deferred revenue within accrued liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets revenues deferred in fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 were not material 

 

goodwill  — goodwill is the excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in various business combinations goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level or more often if indications of impairment exist the number of reporting units tested for goodwill impairment increased in fiscal year 2009 because we tested one level below one of our three operating segments as a result of the impact of the global economic downturn for fiscal year 2009 our reporting units are the adhesive dispensing systems segment the industrial coating systems segment and one level below the advanced technology systems segment based upon the results of our impairment testing we recognized an impairment charge for a reduction in the carrying value of goodwill in the amount of 232789 relating to six reporting units as follows dage 166916 picodostec 7530 yestech 26149 march plasma systems 16449 uv curing 12129 and industrial coating systems 3616 

the goodwill impairment test is a twostep process in the first step performed in the fourth quarter of each year we calculate a reporting unit’s fair value using a discounted cash flow valuation methodology and compare the result against the reporting unit’s carrying value of net assets if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value then a second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired in step one the assumptions used for discounted cash flow revenue growth operating margin and working capital turnover are based on general management’s strategic plans tempered by performance trends and reasonable expectations about those trends with respect to revenue growth assumptions in particular we tempered our outlook for fiscal year 2010 and future years by looking at historical data since the last recession in 2001 and 2002 measuring apparent recovery and rebound growth apart from growth experienced after the recovery and noting order growth for sequential reporting periods during fiscal year 2009 terminal value calculations employ a published formula known as the “gordon growth model method” that essentially captures the present value of perpetual cash flows beyond the last projected period assuming a constant weighted average cost of capital methodology wacc and growth rate for each reporting unit sensitivity calculations vary the discount and terminal growth rates in order to provide a range of assurance that our expected assumptions are fair for detecting impairment 

 

discount rates were developed using a wacc methodology the wacc represents the blended average required rate of return for equity and debt capital based on observed market return data and company specific risk factors the discount rates used ranged from 11 percent to 195 percent depending upon the reporting unit’s size end market volatility and projection risk the calculated internal rate of return for the step one consolidated valuation was 119 percent which is reasonable when compared to a calculated wacc for total nordson of 117 percent 

 

to test the reasonableness of the discounted cash flow valuations we performed the control premium test which compares the sum of the fair values calculated for our reporting units net of debt to the market value of equity the control premium was 30 percent as of the test date of july 31 2009 and 11 percent as of our fiscal year end of october 31 2009 the control premium declined during our fourth quarter due to an increase in market value of equity these comparisons indicated that the discounted cash flow valuation was reasonable 

 

as a result of our step one testing we determined that the second step of impairment testing was necessary in the second step a hypothetical purchase price allocation of the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities is performed using the fair value calculated in step one the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the hypothetical fair value of assets and liabilities is the implied goodwill amount impairment is recorded if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is higher than its implied goodwill the charge recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill after a goodwill impairment charge is recognized the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill becomes its new accounting basis subsequent reversal of a previously recognized goodwill impairment charge is prohibited once the measurement of that charge is completed 

 

the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination including any unrecognized intangible assets the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill that assignment process is performed only for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment we cannot write up or write down a recognized asset or liability nor can we recognize a previously unrecognized intangible asset as a result of that allocation process 

 

following our writedown of goodwill the excess of fair value fv over carrying value cv was compared to the carrying value for remaining reporting units having no impairment based on the results shown in the table below our conclusion is that no remaining impairment exists with respect to the efd reporting unit a decline in fair value exceeding 11 percent would be required for possible impairment potential events or circumstances resulting in a negative effect to the estimated fair value could range from a further downturn in global economies to a much slower recovery than assumed 

 

 

at july 31 2008 we had no indicators of impairment by october 31 2008 all major stock markets had suffered sudden and significant declines for goodwill testing purposes we modified downward our growth and profitability assumptions for what was believed to be a temporary downturn in the economy based on these revised assumptions the excess of fair value over carrying value exceeded 25 percent for the three operating segments tested adhesive dispensing systems advanced technology systems and industrial coating systems 

 

the global economic downturn was occurring early in our fiscal year 2009 and we initiated steps to mitigate the loss of revenue on profitability cash flows and fair value of reporting units we implemented actions to reduce workforce and other costs and to optimize cash flows across reporting units our revenue outlook required time to estimate fairly insight from the volume of customer orders helped us see the bottom monitor points of inflection and see an upturn occurring in quarters three and four accordingly our annual goodwill impairment analysis performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 had the benefit of additional insight to order trends growth expectations and effects of mitigating actions our quarterly assessments looked at the market value of equity confirmed solvency and projected positive liquidity profitability and improving order trends in the second half of the year 

 

in fiscal year 2009 we tested one level below the operating segment level for advanced technology systems primarily because this segment included three acquisitions made in fiscal year 2007 that were still being integrated into the operating segment during fiscal year 2009 integration was incomplete and planned synergies were not yet realized for dage picodostec and yestech and we realized that the change in business climate in fiscal year 2009 could reduce the fair value for these recent acquisitions below their carrying amounts during fiscal year 2009 we recognized that revenue growth assumptions used in the original valuations could not be anticipated in the current economic cycle in addition because of concerns of underperformance and the impact of the economic downturn in fiscal year 2009 we took a closer look at two prior acquisitions — march plasma systems which had goodwill resulting from two acquired companies in 1999 and uv curing which had goodwill resulting from two acquired companies in 1996 and 1999 

 

the industrial coating systems operating segment suffered revenue loss in largedollar engineered systems orders from its primary automotive customers due to bankruptcies and permanent plant closures and from other industrial coating customers who placed fewer orders for large engineered systems during this difficult economic cycle in addition this segment has operated with a less flexible base cost structure adding more risk to profitability and cash flows during economic downturns 

 

other indefinitelived intangible assets  — indefinitelived intangible assets are trademarks and trade names associated with dage picodostec yestech and tah industries indefinitelived intangible assets are not subject to amortization and need to be tested for impairment annually or more often if indications of impairment exist testing is performed at the component level with which the asset is associated the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess after an impairment charge is recognized the adjusted carrying amount of the intangible asset becomes its new accounting basis subsequent reversal of a previously recognized impairment charge is prohibited 

 

the common valuation technique for trademark and trade names is the “relief from royalty method” the theory is that these assets relieve the owner from having to pay a hypothetical royalty attributable to an exclusive license for selling products under the trademark or trade name the value of the hypothetical exclusive license is based upon the present value of a stream of hypothetical royalty payments using assumptions for revenue growth the same as for goodwill testing discount rates slightly more risk premium than for goodwill testing royalty rates based on market data and tax amortization benefits based upon statutory guidance 

 

the conclusion of this testing resulted in impairment charges totaling 8282 as follows by reporting unit dage 5365 picodostec 157 yestech 350 and tah industries 2410 

other longlived assets  — our test for recoverability of longlived depreciable and amortizable assets used undiscounted cash flows except for one asset group for which an external market source was available described below longlived assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows the total carrying value of longlived assets for each reporting unit has been compared to the forecasted cash flows of each reporting unit’s longlived assets being tested cash flows have been defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization less annual maintenance capital spending 

 

estimates of future cash flows used to test the recoverability of a longlived asset asset group are based on the remaining useful life of the asset we believe that the relative value of longlived assets within each reporting unit is a reasonable proxy for the relative importance of the assets in the production of cash flow to get to a reasonable forecast period the aggregate net book value of longlived assets was divided by the current depreciation and amortization value to arrive at a blended remaining useful life for reporting units tested using this methodology our calculations show the undiscounted aggregate value of cash flows over the remaining useful life for each reporting unit is greater than the respective carrying value of the lived assets within each reporting unit we have one asset group within our uv curing reporting unit for which a value obtained from an external market source was used for evaluating recoverability as a result we have recognized a charge of 1972 no further impairment procedures were necessary for our longlived asset groups 

 

inventories  — inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market cost has been determined using the lastin firstout lifo method for 26 percent of consolidated inventories at october 31 2009 and 27 percent at october 31 2008 with the firstin firstout fifo method used for the remaining inventory on an ongoing basis inventory is tested for technical obsolescence as well as for future demand and changes in market conditions we have historically maintained inventory reserves to reflect those conditions when the cost of inventory is not expected to be recovered inventory reserves are also maintained for inventory used for demonstration purposes the inventory reserve balance was 15740 13133 and 12365 at october 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

 

pension plans and postretirement medical plans  — the measurement of liabilities related to our pension plans and postretirement medical plans is based on management’s assumptions related to future factors including interest rates return on pension plan assets compensation increases mortality and turnover assumptions and health care cost trend rates 

 

the weightedaverage discount rate used to determine the present value of our domestic pension plan obligations was 550 percent at october 31 2009 and 800 percent at october 31 2008 the discount rate for these plans which comprised 78 percent of the worldwide pension obligations at october 31 2009 was based on quality fixed income investments with a duration period approximately equal to the period over which pension obligations are expected to be settled the weightedaverage discount rate used to determine the present value of our various international pension plan obligations was 478 percent at october 31 2009 compared to 587 percent at october 31 2008 the discount rates used for the international plans were determined by using quality fixed income investments 

 

in determining the expected return on plan assets we consider both historical performance and an estimate of future longterm rates of return on assets similar to those in our plans we consult with and consider the opinions of financial and actuarial experts in developing appropriate return assumptions the expected rate of return longterm investment rate on domestic pension assets was 851 percent for fiscal year 2009 and 848 percent for fiscal year 2008 the average expected rate of return on international pension assets decreased to 485 percent in fiscal year 2009 from 504 percent in fiscal year 2008 

 

the assumed rate of compensation increases for domestic employees was 330 percent for both fiscal years 2009 and 2008 the assumed rate of compensation increases for international employees was 286 percent in fiscal year 2009 compared to 345 percent in fiscal year 2008 

annual expense amounts are determined based on the discount rate used at the end of the prior year differences between actual and assumed investment returns on pension plan assets result in actuarial gains or losses that are amortized into expense over a period of years 

 

economic assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported the effect of a one percent change in the discount rate expected return on assets and compensation increase is shown in the table below bracketed numbers represent decreases in expense and obligation amounts 

 

 

 

with respect to the domestic postretirement medical plan the discount rate used to value the benefit obligation decreased from 800 percent at october 31 2008 to 550 percent at october 31 2009 the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the health care cost trend rate is assumed to be 825 percent in fiscal year 2010 decreasing gradually to 450 percent in fiscal year 2015 

 

for the international postretirement plan the discount rate used to value the benefit obligation decreased from 770 percent at october 31 2008 to 675 percent at october 31 2009 the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the health care cost trend rate is assumed to be 750 percent in fiscal year 2010 decreasing gradually to 480 percent in fiscal year 2013 

 

the discount rate and the health care cost trend rate assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported for example a onepercentage point change in the discount rate and assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects 

 

 

 

employees hired after january 1 2002 are not eligible to participate in the domestic postretirement medical plan 

 

pension and postretirement expenses in fiscal year 2010 are expected to be approximately 8500 higher than fiscal year 2009 primarily reflecting a change in the discount rate 

financial instruments  — assets liabilities and commitments that are to be settled in cash and are denominated in foreign currencies are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates we enter into foreign currency forward contracts which are derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of foreign currency exposures resulting from the collection of receivables payables and loans denominated in foreign currencies the maturities of these contracts are usually less than 90 days forward contracts are marked to market each accounting period and the resulting gains or losses are included in “other — net” within other income expense on the consolidated statement of income 

 

warranties  — we provide customers with a product warranty that requires us to repair or replace defective products within a specified period of time generally one year from the date of delivery or first use an accrual is recorded for expected warranty costs for products shipped through the end of each accounting period in determining the amount of the accrual we rely primarily on historical warranty claims amounts charged to the warranty reserve were 3824 6070 and 5702 in fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the reserve balance was 4587 5336 and 5857 at october 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

 

longterm incentive compensation plan ltip  — under the longterm incentive compensation plan executive officers and selected other employees receive stock payouts based solely on corporate performance measures over threeyear performance periods payouts vary based on the degree to which corporate performance equals or exceeds predetermined threshold target and maximum performance levels at the end of a performance period no payout will occur unless certain threshold performance objectives are equaled or exceeded the amount of compensation expense is based upon current performance projections for each threeyear period and the percentage of the requisite service that has been rendered the calculation is also based upon the closing price of common shares at the dates of grant payouts are recorded as capital in excess of stated value in shareholders’ equity as performance did not meet the threshold there will be no payout for the fiscal year 20072009 performance period there was 5014 credited to expense attributable to all ltip performance periods for executive officers and selected other employees for fiscal year 2009 there is no cumulative amount recorded in shareholders’ equity at october 31 2009 for fiscal years 2008 and 2007 the amounts charged to expense were 4762 and 4606 respectively 

fiscal years 2009 and 2008 

sales  — as a result of the global economic slowdown worldwide sales for fiscal year 2009 were 819165 a decrease of 272 percent from fiscal year 2008 sales of 1124829 sales volume decreased 233 percent and unfavorable currency translation effects caused by the stronger united states dollar decreased sales by an additional 39 percent over the prior year 

 

sales of the adhesive dispensing systems segment were 460746 in fiscal year 2009 a decrease of 119965 or 207 percent from fiscal year 2008 the change is the result of a sales volume decrease of 163 percent and unfavorable currency translation effects that reduced sales by an additional 44 percent the sales decrease was largely attributable to largedollar system product lines with sales to consumer nondurable end markets such as packaging and nonwovens remaining more stable all product lines within this segment and all geographic regions experienced sales volume decreases from the prior year 

 

sales of the advanced technology systems segment were 248827 in fiscal year 2009 a decrease of 118539 or 323 percent from fiscal year 2008 sales volume decreased 282 percent and unfavorable currency translation effects decreased sales by 41 percent within the segment volume decreases occurred in all product lines and all geographic regions largely due to reduced demand in semiconductor and consumer electronics end markets 

 

industrial coating systems segment sales in fiscal year 2009 were 109592 a decrease of 67160 or 380 percent from the prior year the decrease is the result of a sales volume decrease of 359 percent and unfavorable currency translation effects of 21 percent the sales volume decline was largely due to the lack of capital spending in consumer durable end markets within the segment volume decreases occurred in all product lines and all geographic regions 

 

it is estimated that the effect of pricing on total revenue was neutral relative to the prior fiscal year 

 

sales outside the united states accounted for 713 percent of total fiscal year 2009 sales compared to 719 percent in fiscal year 2008 sales volume in fiscal year 2009 decreased from the prior year in all five geographic regions in which we operate sales volume was down 316 percent in japan 254 percent in the united states 229 percent in europe 193 percent in asia pacific and 140 percent in the americas canada mexico and central and south america sales in all international regions except japan were negatively impacted by the stronger us dollar 

 

operating profit  — cost of sales in fiscal year 2009 was 350239 down 292 percent from fiscal year 2008 due primarily to the decrease in sales volume currency effects reduced cost of sales by 28 percent gross margins expressed as a percent of sales increased to 572 percent in fiscal year 2009 from 560 percent in fiscal year 2008 the increase was due primarily to a higher mix of consumables and aftermarket part sales compared to engineered systems sales the gross margin percentage was also impacted by a reduction of overhead costs related to initiatives to reduce spending in response to the economic slowdown 

 

selling and administrative expenses excluding severance and restructuring costs were 337294 in fiscal year 2009 a decrease of 97182 or 224 percent from fiscal year 2008 the decrease was largely due to reduced compensation expenses associated with lower employment levels furloughs lower incentive compensation expense and tightened control over discretionary spending in addition currency translation effects decreased selling and administrative costs by 42 percent selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 412 percent in fiscal year 2009 from 386 percent in fiscal year 2008 due to the lower level of sales 

 

in september 2008 a cost reduction program that involved a combination of nonworkforce related efficiencies and workforce reductions primarily in north america and europe was announced in response to the continuing economic crisis additional cost reduction actions were taken in fiscal year 2009 it is anticipated that the total severance and related costs of these actions will be approximately 23000 of which 5561 occurred in fiscal year 2008 and 16396 occurred in fiscal year 2009 the remainder will occur in fiscal year 2010 severance costs were recorded in the corporate segment 

in fiscal year 2009 we recognized goodwill and longlived asset impairment charges of 243043 of this amount 232789 related to goodwill 8282 related to indefinite lived trade name assets and 1972 related to other longlived assets additional information regarding these charges is described in the critical accounting policies and estimates section 

 

operating margin was negative 156 percent in fiscal year 2009 compared to operating profit of 169 percent in fiscal year 2008 goodwill and longlived impairment charges accounted for 297 percent of the 325 percent change the remainder of the decrease was due primarily to the reduction in sales volume 

 

segment operating profit margins in fiscal years 2009 and 2008 were as follows 

 

 

 

operating capacity for each of our segments can support fluctuations in order activity without significant changes in operating costs also currency translation affects reported operating profit margins operating margins for each segment were unfavorably impacted by a stronger dollar during the year as compared to the prior year 

 

operating margin for the adhesive dispensing systems segment was 277 percent up from 250 percent in fiscal year 2008 the increase was due primarily to a higher gross margin percentage resulting from a mix of more consumables and aftermarket part sales compared to engineered systems sales in fiscal year 2009 

 

operating margin for the advanced technology systems segment was negative 862 percent in fiscal year 2009 as compared to an operating profit margin of 168 percent in fiscal year 2008 the change is due primarily to goodwill and longlived asset impairment and charges of 239427 excluding these impairment charges operating margin was 101 percent in fiscal year 2009 the decrease from the prior year was due primarily to sales volume decreasing at a higher rate than both cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses 

 

operating margin for the industrial coating systems segment was negative 67 percent in fiscal year 2009 as compared to an operating profit margin of 62 percent in fiscal year 2008 the current year includes a goodwill impairment charge of 3616 excluding this charge operating margin was negative 34 percent the change from fiscal year 2008 was due primarily to sales volume decreasing at a higher rate than selling and administrative expenses 

 

interest and other income expense  — interest expense in fiscal year 2009 was 7771 a decrease of 8943 or 535 percent from fiscal year 2008 due to lower borrowing levels and lower interest rates other income was 7895 in fiscal year 2009 compared to 4914 in fiscal year 2008 included in other income expense were currency gains of 1571 in fiscal year 2009 and 2153 in fiscal year 2008 fiscal year 2009 also includes a 5011 gain on the sale of real estate in westlake ohio 

 

income taxes  — income tax expense was 32864 in fiscal year 2009 most of the goodwill and longlived asset impairment charges in fiscal year 2009 were nondeductible for income tax purposes income tax expense for fiscal year 2008 was 62284 

 

net income loss  — net loss was 160055 or 477 per diluted share in fiscal year 2009 this compares to net income of 117504 or 343 per diluted share in fiscal year 2008 

recently issued accounting standards  — in june 2009 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued the accounting standards codification which establishes a sole source of us authoritative generally accepted accounting principles gaap the codification is meant to simplify user access to all authoritative accounting guidance by reorganizing us gaap pronouncements into approximately ninety accounting topics within a consistent structure its purpose is not to create new accounting and reporting guidance the adoption of this guidance did not have an effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued a standard regarding fair value measurements this standard provides a common definition of fair value and establishes a framework to make the measurement of fair value in generally accepted accounting principles more consistent and comparable it also requires expanded disclosures to provide information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities the methods and assumptions used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measures on earnings in february 2008 the fasb issued an update that permits a oneyear deferral of the original standard for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually as discussed in note 18 we adopted the nondeferred portion of the standard as of november 1 2008 the adoption did not impact our results of operations or financial position we will adopt the deferred portion of this standard effective november 1 2009 

 

in february 2007 the fasb issued a standard for reporting the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities this standard permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and report unrealized gains and losses on these instruments in earnings we did not elect the fair value measurement option for any of our existing financial instruments other than those that are already being measured at fair value as such the adoption of this standard on november 1 2008 did not have an impact on our results of operations or financial position 

 

in december 2007 the fasb issued a standard that provides greater consistency in the accounting and financial reporting of business combinations the standard requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction establishes the acquisitiondate fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed and requires the acquirer to disclose the nature and financial effect of the business combination we must adopt this standard for all business combinations subsequent to november 1 2009 the impact of adoption will depend on the nature and significance of any future acquisitions 

 

in december 2007 the fasb issued a pronouncement that establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary we must adopt this pronouncement in our fiscal year 2010 the impact of adoption will depend on future transactions however we currently believe the adoption will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 

 

in march 2008 the fasb issued a standard that is intended to improve transparency in financial reporting by requiring enhanced disclosures of an entity’s derivative instruments and hedging activities and their effects on the entity’s financial position financial performance and cash flows the standard applies to all derivative instruments as well as related hedged items bifurcated derivatives and nonderivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments entities with instruments subject to this standard must provide more robust qualitative disclosures and expanded quantitative disclosures as discussed in note 10 we adopted this standard in the second quarter of fiscal year 2009 

 

in december 2008 the fasb issued a standard that enhances the required disclosures about plan assets in an employer’s defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan including investment allocations decisions inputs and valuations techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets and significant concentrations of risks within plan assets we must adopt this standard in our fiscal year 2010 we are currently evaluating its disclosure implications 

in may 2009 the fasb issued a standard that establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued the standard requires the disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date it sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date as discussed in note 21 we adopted this standard in the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 

 

in october 2009 the fasb issued authoritative guidance on multipledeliverable revenue arrangements that addresses the unit of accounting for arrangements involving multiple deliverables the guidance also addresses how arrangement consideration should be allocated to separate units of accounting when applicable and expands the disclosure requirements for multipledeliverable arrangements we must adopt this standard in fiscal year 2011 and have not yet determined the impact of adoption on our results of operations or financial position 

 

fiscal years 2008 and 2007 

sales  — worldwide sales for fiscal year 2008 were 1124829 an increase of 132 percent from fiscal year 2007 sales of 993649 organic sales volume increased 51 percent while the first year effect of acquisitions accounted for 38 percentage points of the growth favorable currency translation effects caused by the weaker united states dollar increased sales by an additional 43 percent over the prior year 

 

sales of the adhesive dispensing systems segment were 580711 in fiscal year 2008 an increase of 71143 or 140 percent from fiscal year 2007 the increase was split evenly between sales volume and favorable currency translation effects all product lines within this segment and all geographic regions experienced sales volume increases over the prior year 

 

sales of the advanced technology systems segment were 367366 in fiscal year 2008 an increase of 66647 or 222 percent from fiscal year 2007 the first year effect of acquisitions generated a volume increase of 124 percent while organic sales volume increased 97 percent favorable currency translation effects contributed 01 percent to sales growth within this segment the volume increase can be traced primarily to the asia pacific region the united states and europe as demand improved for our products in certain semiconductor and consumer electronics end markets 

 

industrial coating systems segment sales in fiscal year 2008 were 176752 a decrease of 6610 or 36 percent from the prior year the decrease is the result of a sales volume decrease of 75 percent partially offset by favorable currency translation effects of 39 percent the sales volume decrease can be traced to recent cyclical weakness in key consumer durable goods markets primarily in the united states 

 

it is estimated that the effect of pricing on total revenue was neutral relative to the prior fiscal year 

 

sales outside the united states accounted for 719 percent of total fiscal year 2008 sales up from 693 percent in fiscal year 2007 sales volume in fiscal year 2008 exceeded that of fiscal year 2007 in all five geographic regions in which we operate largely driven by the advanced technology systems segment sales volume was up 217 percent in asia pacific 105 percent in europe 42 percent in japan 35 percent in the united states and 23 percent in the americas canada mexico and central and south america currency translation effects favorably impacted sales in all international regions 

 

operating profit  — cost of sales in fiscal year 2008 was 494394 up 124 percent from fiscal year 2007 due primarily to the increase in sales volume currency effects increased cost of sales by 31 percent gross margins expressed as a percent of sales increased to 560 percent in fiscal year 2008 from 557 percent in fiscal year 2007 the increase was the result of the absence of shortterm inventory purchase accounting adjustments related to acquisitions that reduced the fiscal year 2007 gross margin percentage by approximately 09 percent and favorable currency effects that increased the fiscal year 2008 gross margin rate by 04 percent offsetting these items were changes in product mix that reduced the gross margin percentage 

selling and administrative expenses excluding severance and restructuring costs were 434476 in fiscal year 2008 an increase of 33182 or 83 percent from fiscal year 2007 the increase is largely due to the first year effect of fiscal 2007 acquisitions which added 37 percent and currency translation effects which added 35 percent annual compensation increases and higher employee benefit costs also contributed to the increase selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to 386 percent in fiscal year 2008 from 404 percent in fiscal year 2007 reflecting ongoing operational improvement efforts and revenue increases that were supported by existing capacity 

 

in september 2008 a cost reduction program that involved a combination of nonworkforce related efficiencies and workforce reductions primarily in north america and europe was announced severance costs were 5561 in fiscal year 2008 and were recorded in the corporate segment 

 

our operating profit margin increased to 169 percent in fiscal year 2008 from 153 percent in fiscal year 2007 purchase accounting adjustments for inventory associated with fiscal year 2007 acquisitions reduced that year’s operating profit margin by 09 percent the improvement was also due to favorable currency translation effects and revenue increases that were supported by existing capacity the operating profit margin was reduced by 05 percent as a result of the severance and restructuring costs described above 

 

segment operating profit margins in fiscal years 2008 and 2007 were as follows 

 

 

 

operating capacity for each of our segments can support fluctuations in order activity without significant changes in operating costs also currency translation affects reported operating profit margins operating profit margins for each segment were favorably impacted by a weaker dollar during the year as compared to the prior year 

 

operating profit margin for the adhesive dispensing systems segment was 250 percent up from 232 percent in fiscal year 2007 the increase can be traced to the increased sales volume across all product lines and geographic regions and to favorable currency translation effects 

 

operating profit margin for the advanced technology systems segment increased to 168 percent in fiscal year 2008 from 135 percent in fiscal year 2007 the increase was primarily the result of sales volume increasing at a higher rate than operating costs and the absence of the effect of shortterm purchase accounting adjustments related to fiscal year 2007 acquisitions partially offset by changes in sales mix 

 

operating profit margin for the industrial coating systems segment was 62 percent in fiscal year 2008 as compared to 96 percent in fiscal year 2007 the decrease in the operating profit margin is due primarily to a sales volume decrease of 75 percent and to a higher mix of lower margin system sales 

 

interest and other income expense  — interest expense in fiscal year 2008 was 16714 a decrease of 4828 or 224 percent from fiscal year 2007 due to lower borrowing levels and lower interest rates other income was 4914 in fiscal year 2008 compared to 3617 in fiscal year 2007 included in other income expense were currency gains of 2153 in fiscal year 2008 and currency losses of 1028 in fiscal year 2007 the prior year amount also included a 3038 gain on the saleleaseback of real estate 

 

income taxes  — our effective income tax rate was 346 percent in fiscal year 2008 up from 332 percent in fiscal year 2007 the increased rate is due primarily to a favorable adjustment in fiscal year 2007 related to a prior year tax revision 

 

net income  — net i ncome was 117504 or 343 per diluted share in fiscal year 2008 this compares to net income of 90692 or 265 per diluted share in fiscal year 2007 this represents a 296 percent increase in net income and a 294 percent increase in earnings per share 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash provided by operations in fiscal year 2009 was 168677 compared to 114042 in fiscal year 2008 the primary sources were net income loss adjusted for noncash expenses and the tax benefit from the exercise of stock options totaling 138529 compared to 134968 in fiscal year 2008 also included in cash provided by operations in the current year were changes in operating assets and liabilities of 30148 as compared to fiscal year 2008 when operating assets and liabilities used 20926 of cash the primary reason for the change is the lower level of business activity in the current year resulting in lower operating assets 

 

cash used by investing activities was 3939 in fiscal year 2009 compared to 31924 in fiscal year 2008 capital expenditures were 12514 in fiscal year 2009 down from 26386 in the prior year due to tighter spending control in the current year fiscal year 2009 capital expenditures were primarily focused on our inprocess rollout of sap enterprise management software and various projects that improve manufacturing and distribution proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment in the current year were 8611 and primarily consisted of the sale of our westlake ohio corporate headquarters building and a portion of the real property surrounding the building included in cash used by investing activities in fiscal year 2008 was 7890 for the acquisition of businesses and the minority interest in a south korea joint venture 

 

cash of 161018 was used for financing activities in fiscal year 2009 compared to 102716 in fiscal year 2008 the current year included net repayments of 127268 of short and longterm borrowings compared to 61566 in the prior year issuance of common shares related to employee benefit plans generated 2986 of cash in the current year down from 16135 in the prior year due to fewer stock option exercises purchases of treasury shares used 7115 of cash in fiscal year 2009 down from 35615 in fiscal year 2008 as we focused on repayment of debt in the current year dividend payments were 24747 in fiscal year 2009 up slightly from 24645 in fiscal year 2008 due to an increase in the quarterly dividend from 01825 per share to 019 per share in the fourth quarter of the current year 

 

the following is a summary of significant changes by balance sheet caption from the end of fiscal year 2008 to the end of fiscal year 2009 receivables inventories and accounts payable decreased due primarily to lower level of business activity in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 longterm deferred tax assets increased due primarily to deferred taxes related to pension and postretirement adjustments to other comprehensive income regarding the increase in income taxes payable the balance at the end of fiscal year 2008 was reduced to record an expected refund that was received during fiscal year 2009 accrued liabilities decreased due primarily to lower incentive compensation accruals the increase in longterm pension and retirement liabilities is due primarily to lower discount rates in fiscal year 2009 as compared to fiscal year 2008 

 

on february 22 2008 we entered into a note purchase and private shelf agreement the agreement with prudential investment management inc the agreement consists of a 50000 senior note and a 100000 private shelf facility the senior note bears interest at a rate of 498 percent and matures on february 22 2013 the agreement also contains customary events of default and covenants related to limitations on indebtedness and the maintenance of certain financial ratios we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants at october 31 2009 under the private shelf facility we may also borrow during the next three years up to 100000 at interest rates in effect at the time of borrowing borrowings can be for up to 12 years with an average life not to exceed 10 years at october 31 2009 the amount we could borrow under the private shelf facility would not have been limited by any debt covenants 

 

the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 1000 of our common shares over a threeyear period beginning november 2006 the resolution was amended in august 2007 permitting the use of written agreements with independent third party brokers to purchase common shares on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions uses for repurchased shares include the funding of benefit programs including stock options restricted stock and 401k matching shares purchased are treated as treasury shares until used for such purposes the repurchase program is funded using working capital during fiscal year 2009 we repurchased 197 shares at a cost of 6826 completing the repurchases authorized under this program 

on december 10 2008 the board of directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to 1000 shares over a threeyear period beginning december 22 2008 expected uses for repurchased shares include the funding of benefit programs including stock options nonvested stock and 401k matching there have been no shares repurchased under this program 

 

the following table summarizes obligations as of october 31 2009 

 

 

 

1 we have a 400000 unsecured multicurrency credit facility with a group of banks that expires in fiscal year 2012 and may be increased to 500000 under certain conditions at october 31 2009 88000 was outstanding under this facility compared to 170000 outstanding at october 31 2008 there are two primary financial covenants that must be met under this facility the first covenant limits the amount of total indebtedness that can be incurred to 35 times consolidated trailing ebitda both indebtedness and ebitda as defined in the credit agreement the second covenant requires consolidated trailing ebitda to be at least three times consolidated trailing interest expense both as defined in the credit agreement we were in compliance with all debt covenants at october 31 2009 at october 31 2009 the amount we could borrow under the credit facility would not have been limited by any debt covenants 

 

2 we have various lines of credit with foreign banks totaling 48433 of which 47146 was unused at october 31 2009 

 

3 pension and postretirement plan funding amounts after fiscal year 2010 will be determined based on the future funded status of the plans and therefore cannot be estimated at this time 

 

we believe that the combination of present capital resources internally generated funds and unused financing sources are more than adequate to meet cash requirements for fiscal year 2010 there are no significant restrictions limiting the transfer of funds from international subsidiaries to the parent company 

outlook 

disruptions in global financial markets and resulting turmoil in the general economic environment during fiscal year 2009 likely will have a continuing impact on our performance in fiscal year 2010 however we are confident that we are well positioned to manage the impact upon our liquidity our liquidity needs arise from working capital requirements capital expenditures and principal and interest payments on indebtedness primary sources of capital to meet these needs are cash provided by operations and borrowings under our loan agreements in fiscal year 2009 cash from operations was 20 percent of revenue comparatively during the 2001 and 2002 recession years cash from operations were 10 percent and 20 percent respectively and then ranged from 10 percent to 14 percent in subsequent years until fiscal year 2009 funds provided by borrowings occur under a 400000 fiveyear committed revolving line of credit with 12 domestic and international banks that expires in 2012 as of october 31 2009 we were in compliance with the financial covenant of this credit facility and have 312000 available borrowing capacity in addition in february 2008 we entered into a master shelf arrangement with the prudential insurance company to allow for the issuance of medium to longterm unsecured notes as of october 31 2009 we are in compliance with the financial covenant relating to a 50000 fiveyear note issued under this arrangement while these facilities provide the contractual terms for any borrowing we cannot be assured that these facilities would be available in the event of these financial institutions failure to remain sufficiently capitalized 

 

we are taking a cautious approach to fiscal year 2010 our priorities for fiscal year 2010 are focused on the continuation of strategic actions taken in fiscal year 2009 to optimize revenue opportunities in a challenging economic environment and to sustain the operational improvements achieved through a combination of nonworkforce related efficiencies and workforce reductions given our assumption that economic challenges will continue to impact us in fiscal year 2010 we expect these efforts will provide sufficient cash from operations to meet our liquidity needs with respect to spending the table above presents nordson’s financial obligations for the longterm as 281798 of which 97909 is payable in fiscal year 2010 on december 10 2008 our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to 1000 shares under this authorization the timing and actual number of shares subject to repurchase are at the discretion of management and are contingent on a number of factors including levels of cash generation from operations cash requirements for acquisitions repayment of debt and our share price capital expenditures for fiscal year 2010 will be focused primarily upon our inprocess rollout of sap various facility projects that improve manufacturing and distribution and a new corporate facility to replace the building sold in fiscal year 2009 

 

as the economic climate improves we will continue to look for strategic acquisition opportunities we will continue to develop new applications and markets for our technologies and move forward with additional lean and other operational initiatives to enhance our financial performance 

 

effects of foreign currency 

the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on sales and operating results cannot be precisely measured due to fluctuating selling prices sales volume product mix and cost structures in each country where we operate as a general rule a weakening of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies has a favorable effect on sales and net income while a strengthening of the dollar has a detrimental effect 

 

in fiscal year 2009 as compared with fiscal year 2008 the united states dollar was generally stronger against foreign currencies if fiscal year 2008 exchange rates had been in effect during fiscal year 2009 sales would have been approximately 43952 higher and thirdparty costs would have been approximately 31898 higher in fiscal year 2008 as compared with fiscal year 2007 the united states dollar was generally weaker against foreign currencies if fiscal year 2007 exchange rates had been in effect during fiscal year 2008 sales would have been approximately 43051 lower and thirdparty costs would have been approximately 27719 lower these effects on reported sales do not include the impact of local price adjustments made in response to changes in currency exchange rates 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

we operate internationally and enter into intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies consequently we are subject to market risk arising from exchange rate movements between the dates foreign currencies are recorded and the dates they are settled we regularly use foreign exchange contracts to reduce our risks related to most of these transactions these contracts primarily associated with the euro yen and british pound typically have maturities of 90 days or less and generally require the exchange of foreign currencies for united states dollars at rates stated in the contracts gains and losses from changes in the market value of these contracts offset foreign exchange losses and gains respectively on the underlying transactions other transactions denominated in foreign currencies are designated as hedges of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries or are intercompany transactions of a longterm investment nature as a result of the use of foreign exchange contracts on a routine basis to reduce the risks related to most of our transactions denominated in foreign currencies as of october 31 2009 we did not have material foreign currency exposure 

 

note 10 to the financial statements contains additional information about our foreign currency transactions and the methods and assumptions used to record these transactions 

 

a portion of our operations is financed with shortterm and longterm borrowings and is subject to market risk arising from changes in interest rates 

 

the tables that follow present principal repayments and related weightedaverage interest rates by expected maturity dates of fixedrate debt 

 

at october 31 2009 

 

 

we also have variablerate notes payable and longterm debt the weighted average interest rate of this debt was 06 percent at october 31 2009 and 37 percent at october 31 2008 a one percent increase in interest rates would have resulted in additional interest expense of approximately 1661 on the variable rate notes payable and longterm debt in fiscal year 2009 

inflation 

inflation affects profit margins as the ability to pass cost increases on to customers is restricted by the need for competitive pricing although inflation has been modest in recent years and has had no material effect on the years covered by these financial statements we continue to seek ways to minimize the impact of inflation through focused efforts to increase productivity 

 

trends 

the fiveyear summary in item 6 documents our historical financial trends over this period the world’s economic conditions fluctuated significantly our solid performance is attributed to our participation in diverse geographic and industrial markets and our longterm commitment to develop and provide quality products and worldwide service to meet our customers’ changing needs

while external factors may impact value the achievement of this goal will rest with earnings growth capital and human resource efficiency and positioning for the future 

 

nordson does not expect every quarter to produce increased sales earnings and earnings per share or to exceed the comparative prior year’s quarter we do expect to produce longterm gains when shortterm swings occur we do not intend to alter our basic objectives in efforts to mitigate the impact of these natural occurrences 

 

growth is achieved by seizing opportunities with existing products and markets investing in systems to maximize productivity and pursuing growth markets this strategy is augmented through product line additions engineering research and development and acquisition of companies that can serve multinational industrial markets

manufacturing and raw materials 

nordson’s production operations include machining and assembly we manufacture specially designed parts and assemble components into finished equipment many components are made in standard modules that can be used in more than one product or in combination with other components for a variety of models nordson has principal manufacturing operations in the united states in amherst ohio norcross swainsboro and dawsonville georgia carlsbad california robbinsville new jersey and east providence rhode island as well as in shanghai and suzhou china luneburg germany bangalore india maastricht the netherlands and in slough and aylesbury united kingdom 

 

principal materials used to make our products are metals and plastics typically in sheets bar stock castings forgings and tubing nordson also purchases many electrical and electronic components fabricated metal parts highpressure fluid hoses packings seals and other items integral to its products suppliers are competitively selected based on cost quality and service all significant raw materials that we use are available through multiple sources 

 

nordson’s senior operating executives supervise an extensive quality control program for our equipment machinery and systems 

 

natural gas and other fuels are our primary energy sources however standby capacity for alternative sources is available if needed 

 

intellectual property 

nordson maintains procedures to protect its intellectual property including patents trademarks and copyrights both domestically and internationally risk factors associated with our intellectual property are discussed in item 1a risk factors 

 

seasonal variation in business 

generally the highest volume of sales occurs in our fourth fiscal quarter due in large part to the timing of customers’ capital spending programs firstquarter sales volume is typically the lowest of the year due to customer holiday shutdowns 

 

working capital practices 

no special or unusual practices affect our working capital however nordson generally requires advance payments as deposits on customized equipment and systems and in certain cases requires progress payments during the manufacturing of these products we have initiated a number of new processes focused on reduction of manufacturing lead times these initiatives have resulted in lower investment in inventory while maintaining the capability to respond promptly to customer needs 

 

customers 

nordson serves a broad customer base both in terms of industries and geographic regions in fiscal year 2008 no single customer accounted for 5 percent of sales 

 

backlog 

nordson’s backlog of open orders decreased to approximately 82000 at october 31 2008 from approximately 98000 at october 31 2007 the decrease can be traced primarily to lower advanced technology systems backlog and to unfavorable effects of changes in currency rates all orders in the fiscal 2008 yearend backlog are expected to be shipped to customers in fiscal year 2009 

 

government contracts 

nordson’s business neither includes nor depends upon a significant amount of governmental contracts or subcontracts therefore no material part of our business is subject to renegotiation or termination at the option of the government 

 

competitive conditions 

nordson equipment is sold in competition with a wide variety of alternative bonding sealing caulking finishing coating testing and inspection techniques any production process that requires surface preparation or modification application of material to a substrate or surface curing or testing and inspection is a potential use for our equipment 

 

many factors influence nordson’s competitive position including pricing product quality and service we enjoy a leadership position in our business segments by delivering highquality innovative products and technologies as well as afterthesale service and technical support working with customers to understand their processes and developing the application solutions that help them meet their production requirements also contributes to nordson’s leadership position our worldwide network of direct sales and technical resources also is a competitive advantage 

 

research and development 

investments in research and development are important to nordson’s longterm growth enabling us to keep pace with changing customer and marketplace needs through the development of new products and new applications for existing products we place strong emphasis on technology developments and improvements through internal engineering and research teams research and development expenses related to continuing operations were approximately 33566 in fiscal year 2008 compared with approximately 35432 in fiscal year 2007 and 25336 in fiscal year 2006 

 

environmental compliance 

nordson is subject to extensive federal state local and foreign environmental safety and health laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to land and water and the generation handling treatment and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials under certain of these laws we can be held strictly liable for hazardous substance contamination of any real property we have ever owned operated or used as a disposal site or for natural resource damages associated with such contamination nordson is also required to maintain various related permits and licenses many of which require periodic modification and renewal the operation of manufacturing plants unavoidably entails environmental safety and health risks and we could incur material unanticipated costs or liabilities in the future if any of these risks were realized in ways or to an extent that we did not anticipate 

 

we believe that we operate in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations compliance with environmental laws and regulations requires continuing management effort and expenditures we have incurred and will continue to incur costs and capital expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations and to obtain and maintain the necessary permits and licenses we believe that the cost of complying with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material affect on our earnings liquidity or competitive position but cannot assure that material compliancerelated costs and expenses may not arise in the future for example future adoption of new or amended environmental laws regulations or requirements or newly discovered contamination or other circumstances that require us to incur costs and expenses that cannot be presently anticipated 

 

nordson believes that policies practices and procedures have been properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of material environmental damage arising from its operations we accrue for estimated environmental liabilities with charges to expense and believe our environmental accrual is adequate to provide for our portion of the costs of all such known environmental liabilities except for the disclosure in item 3 legal proceedings compliance with federal state and local environmental protection laws during fiscal year 2008 had no material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position based upon consideration of currently available information we believe liabilities for environmental matters will not have a material adverse affect on our financial position operating results or liquidity but we cannot assure that material environmental liabilities may not arise in the future 

 

employees 

as of october 31 2008 nordson had 4111 full and parttime employees including 141 at our amherst ohio facility that are represented by a collective bargaining agreement that expires on october 31 2010 no material work stoppages have been experienced at any of our facilities during any of the periods covered by this report

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

in an enterprise as diverse as nordson’s a wide range of factors could affect future performance we discuss in this section some of the risk factors that if they actually occurred could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition value and results of operations you should consider these risk factors in connection with evaluating the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k because these factors could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected in forwardlooking statements the risks that we highlight below are not the only ones that we face additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know about or that we currently believe will be immaterial may also affect our business 

 

the significant risk factors affecting our operations include the following 

 

changes in us or international economic conditions could adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses 

in fiscal year 2008 28 percent of nordson’s revenue was derived from domestic customers while 72 percent was derived from international customers our largest markets include appliance automotive bookbinding construction container converting electronics assembly food and beverage furniture life sciences medical metal finishing nonwovens packaging and semiconductor a slowdown in any of these specific end markets could directly affect our revenue stream and profitability 

a portion of our product sales is attributable to industries and markets such as the semiconductor and metal finishing industries which historically have been cyclical and sensitive to relative changes in supply and demand and general economic conditions the demand for our products depends in part on the general economic conditions of the industries or national economies of our customers downward economic cycles in our customers’ industries or countries may reduce sales of some of our products it is not possible to predict accurately the factors that will affect demand for our products in the future 

 

any significant downturn in the health of the general economy either globally regionally or in the markets in which we sell products could have an adverse effect on our revenues and financial performance 

 

inability to access capital could impede growth or the repayment or refinancing of existing indebtedness 

the limits imposed on us by the restrictive covenants contained in our credit facilities could prevent us from making acquisitions or cause us to lose access to these facilities 

 

our existing credit facilities contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to among other things 

 

  

in addition our credit facilities require us to meet financial ratios including total indebtedness to consolidated trailing ebitda both as defined in the credit facility and consolidated trailing ebitda to consolidated trailing interest expense as defined in the credit facility 

 

these restrictions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs and could otherwise restrict our financing activities 

 

nordson’s ability to comply with the covenants and other terms of our credit facilities will depend on our future operating performance if we fail to comply with such covenants and terms we will be in default and the maturity of the related debt could be accelerated and become immediately due and payable we may be required to obtain waivers from our lenders in order to maintain compliance under our credit facilities including waivers with respect to our compliance with certain financial covenants if we are unable to obtain necessary waivers and the debt under our credit facilities is accelerated we would be required to obtain replacement financing at prevailing market rates 

 

we may need new or additional financing in the future to expand our business or refinance existing indebtedness if we are unable to access capital on satisfactory terms and conditions we may not be able to expand our business or meet our payment requirements under our existing credit facilities our ability to obtain new or additional financing will depend on a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control we may not be able to obtain new or additional financing because we have substantial debt or because we may not have sufficient cash flow to service or repay our existing or future debt in addition depending on market conditions and our financial performance neither debt nor equity financing may be available on satisfactory terms or at all finally as a consequence of worsening financial market conditions our credit facility providers may not provide the agreed capital if they become undercapitalized 

 

significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates or change in monetary policy may harm our financial results 

nordson is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly with respect to the euro the british pound and the yen any significant change in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business against the us dollar could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for additional detail related to this risk see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

the majority of nordson’s consolidated revenues in fiscal year 2008 were generated in currencies other than the us dollar which is our reporting currency we recognize foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from our operations in the period incurred as a result currency fluctuations between the us dollar and the currencies in which we do business have caused and will continue to cause foreign currency transaction and translation gains and losses which historically have been material and could continue to be material we cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future operating results because of the number of currencies involved the variability of currency exposures and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates nordson takes actions to manage our foreign currency exposure such as entering into hedging transactions where available but we cannot assure that our strategies will adequately protect our consolidated operating results from the effects of exchange rate fluctuations 

 

we also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or customers located in or conducting business in a country imposing controls currency devaluations diminish the us dollar value of the currency of the country instituting the devaluation and if they occur or continue for significant periods could adversely affect our earnings or cash flow 

 

we could be adversely affected by rapid changes in interest rates 

any period of unexpected or rapid increase in interest rates may also adversely affect our profitability at october 31 2008 nordson had 284901 of total debt outstanding of which approximately 74 percent was priced at interest rates that float with the market a 1 percent increase in the interest rate on the floating rate debt in fiscal year 2008 would have resulted in approximately 2431 of additional interest expense a higher level of floating rate debt would increase the exposure discussed above for additional detail related to this risk see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions and we may not be able to make acquisitions of suitable candidates or integrate acquisitions successfully 

nordson’s recent historical growth has also depended and our future growth is likely to continue to depend in part on our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses into our existing operations we intend to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world we cannot assure however that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates prevail against competing potential acquirers negotiate appropriate acquisition terms obtain financing that may be needed to consummate such acquisitions complete proposed acquisitions successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new markets in addition we cannot assure that any acquisition once successfully integrated will perform as planned be accretive to earnings or prove to be beneficial to our operations and cash flow 

 

the success of any acquisition is subject to other risks and uncertainties including 

 

 9 

 

in addition an acquisition could adversely impact our operating performance as a result of the incurrence of acquisitionrelated debt acquisition expenses or the amortization of acquisitionacquired assets 

 

we may also face liability with respect to acquired businesses for violations under environmental laws occurring prior to the date of our acquisition and some or all of these liabilities may not be covered by environmental insurance secured to mitigate the risk or by indemnification from the sellers from which we acquired these businesses we could also incur significant costs including but not limited to remediation costs natural resources damages civil or criminal fines and sanctions and thirdparty claims as a result of past or future violations of or liabilities under environmental laws 

 

the inability to continue to develop new products could limit nordson’s revenue and profitability 

innovation is critical to our success we believe that we must continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and manufacture new products with improved capabilities in order to continue to be a market leader we also believe that we must continue to make improvements in our productivity in order to maintain our competitive position our inability to anticipate respond to or utilize changing technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated results of operations 

 

our inability to protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect product sales and financial performance 

difficulties in acquiring and maintaining our intellectual property rights could also adversely affect our business and financial position our performance may depend in part on our ability to establish protect and enforce intellectual property rights with respect to our patented technologies and proprietary rights and to defend against any claims of infringement these activities involve complex and constantly evolving legal scientific and factual questions and uncertainties nordson’s ability to compete effectively with other companies depends in part on our ability to maintain and enforce our patents and other proprietary rights which are essential to our business these measures afford only limited protection and may not in all cases prevent our competitors from gaining access to our intellectual property and proprietary information 

 

litigation has been and may continue to be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets and to determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights in addition nordson may face claims of infringement that could interfere with our ability to use technology or other intellectual property rights that are material to our business operations if litigation that we initiate is unsuccessful we may not be able to protect the value of some of our intellectual property if a claim of infringement against us is successful we may be required to pay royalties or license fees to continue to use technology or other intellectual property rights that we have been using or we may be unable to obtain necessary licenses from third parties at a reasonable cost or within a reasonable time if nordson is unable to timely obtain licenses on reasonable terms we may be forced to cease selling or using any of our products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property or to redesign or in the case of trademark claims rename our products to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties this may not always be possible or if possible may be time consuming and expensive intellectual property litigation whether successful or unsuccessful could be expensive to us and divert some of our resources nordson’s intellectual property rights may not be as valuable as we believe which could result in a competitive disadvantage or adversely affect our business and financial performance 

political conditions in foreign countries in which we operate could adversely affect us 

nordson conducts its manufacturing sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and is subject to risks associated with doing business outside the united states in fiscal year 2008 approximately 72 percent of our total sales were to customers outside the us we expect that international operations and us export sales will continue to be important to our business for the foreseeable future both the sales from international operations and us export sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside the united states such risks include but are not limited to the following 

 

  

any of these events could reduce the demand for our products limit the prices at which we can sell our products or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operating performance

a — during fiscal year 2007 nordson sold a 75000 square foot complex in east providence rhode island and a 44000 square foot facility in lincoln rhode island and purchased a 116000 square foot facility in east providence rhode island the two sold properties are being leased back until december 31 2008 

 

the facilities listed above have adequate suitable and sufficient capacity production and nonproduction to meet present and foreseeable demand for our products 

 

other properties at international subsidiary locations and at branch locations within the united states are leased lease terms do not exceed 25 years and generally contain a provision for cancellation with some penalty at an earlier date 

 

in addition nordson leases equipment under various operating and capitalized leases information about leases is reported in note 8 of notes to consolidated financial statements that can be found in part ii item 8 of this document

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend  

nordson is involved in pending or potential litigation regarding environmental product liability patent contract employee and other matters arising from the normal course of business including the environmental matter discussed below it is our opinion after consultation with legal counsel that resolutions of these matters are not expected to result in a material effect on our financial condition quarterly or annual operating results or cash flows 

 

environmental — nordson has voluntarily agreed with the city of new richmond wisconsin and other potentially responsible parties “prp” to share costs associated with the remediation of the city of new richmond municipal landfill the “site” and constructing a potable water delivery system serving the impacted area down gradient of the site 

 

the feasibility study  remedial investigation for this project was completed and approved by the wisconsin department of natural resources “wdnr” in september 2006 in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 the prps signed an environmental repair contract with the wdnr the estimated cost to nordson for site remediation constructing a potable water delivery system and ongoing operation maintenance and monitoring “omm” at the site and the impacted area down gradient of the site over the statutory monitoring period of 30 years is 3008 at october 31 2007 the company recorded 1858 in other current liabilities and the remaining amount of 1150 was classified as longterm during fiscal year 2008 1858 was paid in fulfillment of our obligation to fund a portion of the estimated cost of site remediation construction of the potable water delivery system and one year of omm at october 31 2008 the remaining obligation for omm consists of 40 in accrued liabilities and 1110 in other longterm liabilities 

 

during fiscal year 2008 agreements were reached with seven insurance companies that resulted in reimbursement to nordson of 1863 for costs related to this remediation project 

 

the liability for environmental remediation represents management’s best estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable undiscounted costs related to known remediation obligations the accuracy of our estimate of environmental liability is affected by several uncertainties such as additional requirements that may be identified in connection with remedial activities the complexity and evolution of environmental laws and regulations and the identification of presently unknown remediation requirements consequently our liability could be greater than our current estimate however we do not expect that the costs associated with remediation will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

critical accounting policies and estimates 

nordson’s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses on an ongoing basis we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that are used to prepare financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates used by management 

 

certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to nordson’s results of operations or financial position are discussed below on a regular basis critical accounting policies are reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 

 

revenue recognition  — most of nordson’s revenues are recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the sales price is fixed or determinable collectibility is reasonably assured and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer revenues from contracts with multiple element arrangements such as those including installation or other services are recognized as each element is earned based on objective evidence of the relative fair value of each element if the installation or other services are inconsequential to the functionality of the delivered product the entire amount of revenue is recognized upon satisfaction of the criteria noted above inconsequential installation or other services are those that can generally be completed in a short period of time at insignificant cost and the skills required to complete these installations are not unique to nordson if installation or other services are essential to the functionality of the delivered product revenues attributable to these obligations are deferred until completed amounts received in excess of revenue recognized are included as deferred revenue within accrued liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets revenues deferred in fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 were not material 

 

goodwill  — goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired at october 31 2008 and october 31 2007 goodwill represented 49 percent and 47 percent respectively of nordson’s total assets the majority of the goodwill resulted from the acquisition of dage holdings limited in fiscal year 2007 and efd inc in fiscal year 2001 in accordance with fasb statement no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level or more often if indications of impairment exist our reporting units as defined by the standard are our three operating segments adhesive dispensing systems advanced technology systems and industrial coating and automotive systems the impairment test is a twostep process in the first step we calculate a fair value using a discounted cash flow valuation methodology and compare the result against the carrying value for net assets of each reporting unit this analysis assumed that the impact of current economic conditions upon revenue growth would be temporary lasting through fiscal year 2009 and also included savings traced to identified employee reductions associated with announced restructuring actions the excess of the fair value over the carrying value is compared to the carrying value for each reporting unit the current fair value determination results in an amount that exceeds the carrying amount of each reporting unit by a moderate to substantial margin based on these results the second step of the goodwill impairment test does not need to be performed 

to test the outcome of the discounted cash flow valuations the combined results are compared to the market capitalization value net of debt and our published share price this comparison indicated that the discounted cash flow valuation is well above the market capitalization at yearend however this is traced to a recent and dramatic reduction in the trading value of nordson’s stock with the exception of one quarter in fiscal year 2000 nordson’s priceearnings multiple has not been below 15 in any quarter over the past 15 years the priceearnings multiple using the closing price on october 31 2008 has declined to approximately eleven as a consequence of the current global economic crisis during which all major stock markets have suffered significant declines 

 

inventories  — inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market cost has been determined using the lastin firstout lifo method for 27 percent of consolidated inventories at october 31 2008 and 28 percent at october 31 2007 with the firstin firstout fifo method used for the remaining inventory on an ongoing basis inventory is tested for technical obsolescence as well as for future demand and changes in market conditions nordson has historically maintained inventory reserves to reflect those conditions when the cost of inventory is not expected to be recovered inventory reserves are also maintained for inventory used for demonstration purposes the inventory reserve balance was 13133 12365 and 8576 at october 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the fiscal year 2007 increase is attributable to acquisitions and currency changes 

 

pension plans and postretirement medical plan  — the measurement of liabilities related to nordson’s pension plans and postretirement medical plan is based on management’s assumptions related to future factors including interest rates return on pension plan assets compensation increases mortality and turnover assumptions and health care cost trend rates 

 

effective october 31 2007 nordson adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 158 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans — an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r fas 158 this statement requires employers to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit postretirement plans in their balance sheets this amount is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation of the plans the projected benefit obligation for pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for other postretirement plans changes in the funded status of the plans are recognized in the year in which the change occurs through accumulated other comprehensive income under fas 158 gains and losses prior service costs and credits and any remaining transition amounts under fas no 87 employers’ accounting for pensions and fas no 106 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions that have not yet been recognized through net periodic benefit cost are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax effects 

 

the weightedaverage discount rate used to determine the present value of our domestic pension plan obligations was 800 percent at october 31 2008 compared to 625 percent at october 31 2007 the discount rate for these plans which comprised 77 percent of the worldwide pension obligations at october 31 2008 was based on quality fixed income investments with a duration period approximately equal to the period over which pension obligations are expected to be settled the weightedaverage discount rate used to determine the present value of nordson’s various international pension plan obligations was 587 percent at october 31 2008 compared to 500 percent at october 31 2007 the discount rates used for the international plans were determined by using quality fixed income investments 

 

in determining the expected return on plan assets nordson considers both historical performance and an estimate of future longterm rates of return on assets similar to those in our plans we consult with and consider the opinions of financial and actuarial experts in developing appropriate return assumptions the expected rate of return longterm investment rate on domestic pension assets was 848 percent for both fiscal years 2008 and 2007 the average expected rate of return on international pension assets increased to 504 percent in fiscal year 2008 from 499 percent in fiscal year 2007 

 

the assumed rate of compensation increases for domestic employees was 330 percent for both fiscal years 2008 and 2007 the assumed rate of compensation increases for international employees was 345 percent in fiscal year 2008 compared to 336 percent in fiscal year 2007 

annual expense amounts are determined based on the discount rate used at the end of the prior year differences between actual and assumed investment returns on pension plan assets result in actuarial gains or losses that are amortized into expense over a period of years 

 

economic assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported the effect of a one percent change in the discount rate expected return on assets and compensation increase is shown in the table below bracketed numbers represent decreases in expense and obligation amounts 

 

 

 

with respect to the domestic postretirement medical plan the discount rate used to value the benefit obligation increased from 625 percent at october 31 2007 to 800 percent at october 31 2008 the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the health care cost trend rate is assumed to be 900 percent in fiscal year 2009 decreasing gradually to 450 percent in fiscal year 2015 

 

for the international postretirement plan the discount rate used to value the benefit obligation increased from 525 percent at october 31 2007 to 770 percent at october 31 2008 the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the health care cost trend rate is assumed to be 850 percent in fiscal year 2009 decreasing gradually to 480 percent in fiscal year 2013 

 

the discount rate and the health care cost trend rate assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported for example a onepercentage point change in the discount rate and assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects 

 

 

 

employees hired after january 1 2002 are not eligible to participate in the domestic postretirement medical plan 

 

pension and postretirement expenses in fiscal year 2009 are expected to be approximately 3000 lower than fiscal year 2008 primarily reflecting changes in actuarial assumptions 

financial instruments  — assets liabilities and commitments that are to be settled in cash and are denominated in foreign currencies are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates nordson enters into foreign currency forward contracts which are derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of foreign currency exposures resulting from the collection of receivables payables and loans denominated in foreign currencies the maturities of these contracts are usually less than 90 days forward contracts are marked to market each accounting period and the resulting gains or losses are included in “other — net” within other income expense on the consolidated statement of income 

 

warranties  — nordson provides customers with a product warranty that requires us to repair or replace defective products within a specified period of time generally one year from the date of delivery or first use an accrual is recorded for expected warranty costs for products shipped through the end of each accounting period in determining the amount of the accrual we rely primarily on historical warranty claims by product sold amounts charged to the warranty reserve were 6070 5702 and 6092 in fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the reserve balance was 5336 5784 and 4917 at october 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

 

longterm incentive compensation plan ltip  — under the longterm incentive compensation plan executive officers and selected other employees receive cash or stock payouts based solely on corporate performance measures over threeyear performance periods payouts vary based on the degree to which corporate performance equals or exceeds predetermined threshold target and maximum performance levels at the end of a performance period no payout will occur unless nordson equals or exceeds certain threshold performance objectives 

 

for the fiscal years 20062008 fiscal years 20072009 and the fiscal years 20082010 performance periods payouts will be in common shares the amount of compensation expense is based upon current performance projections for each threeyear period and the percentage of the requisite service that has been rendered the calculation is also based upon the weightedaverage value of nordson’s common shares at the dates of grant these payouts are recorded as capital in excess of stated value in shareholders’ equity the amount recorded at october 31 2008 for the plans originating in fiscal years 2006 2007 and 2008 was 9483 

 

compensation expense attributable to all ltip performance periods for executive officers and selected other employees for fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 was 4762 4606 and 5456 respectively 

 

discontinued operations 

on october 13 2006 nordson entered into an agreement to sell its fiber systems group to saurer ltd for 5966 the fiber systems group was acquired in fiscal year 1998 as part of the acquisition of jm laboratories as a means of expanding the adhesive dispensing systems segment however due to the changing competitive environment the fiber systems group did not meet nordson’s financial performance objectives the sale enabled us to concentrate our activities on better performing or faster growing businesses proceeds of 5411 were received on the closing date with the remaining 555 to be paid over an 18month period following the closing date settlement of a dispute related to the collectibility of letters of credit resulted in receipt of 295 of the remaining 555 in accordance with fasb statement of accounting standards no 144 the results of this business have been classified as discontinued operations accordingly the revenues costs and expenses assets and liabilities and cash flows of this business have been segregated in the consolidated statements of income consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows 

 

sales of the discontinued operations were 5919 for fiscal year 2006 the net loss from operations was 9882 for fiscal year 2006 included in the fiscal year 2006 loss from discontinued operations was severance expense of 699 related to 27 employees of the fiber systems group that were not hired by saurer ltd also included in the fiscal year 2006 loss from discontinued operations is the recognition of an impairment of an intangible asset of 2630 a gain of 2813 was recognized on the sale of the assets the net tax benefit of 1872 on disposal is the result of 2867 tax expense on onetime gains resulting from the disposal offset by 4739 tax benefit resulting from an excess of tax basis over book basis in fiber systems group assets 

fiscal years 2008 and 2007 

sales  — worldwide sales for fiscal year 2008 were 1124829 an increase of 132 percent from fiscal year 2007 sales of 993649 organic sales volume increased 51 percent while the first year effect of acquisitions accounted for 38 percentage points of the growth favorable currency translation effects caused by the weaker us dollar increased sales by an additional 43 percent over the prior year 

 

sales of the adhesive dispensing systems segment were 580711 in fiscal year 2008 an increase of 71143 or 140 percent from fiscal year 2007 the increase was split evenly between sales volume and favorable currency translation effects all product lines within this segment and all geographic regions experienced sales volume increases over the prior year 

 

sales of the advanced technology systems segment were 367366 in fiscal year 2008 an increase of 66647 or 222 percent from fiscal year 2007 the first year effect of acquisitions generated a volume increase of 124 percent while organic sales volume increased 97 percent favorable currency translation effects contributed 01 percent to sales growth within this segment the volume increase can be traced primarily to the asia pacific region the us and europe as demand improved for our products in certain semiconductor and consumer electronics end markets 

 

industrial coating and automotive systems segment sales in fiscal year 2008 were 176752 a decrease of 6610 or 36 percent from the prior year the decrease is the result of a sales volume decrease of 75 percent partially offset by favorable currency translation effects of 39 percent the sales volume decrease can be traced to recent cyclical weakness in key consumer durable goods markets primarily in the us 

 

it is estimated that the effect of pricing on total revenue was neutral relative to the prior fiscal year 

 

sales outside the united states accounted for 719 percent of total fiscal year 2008 sales up from 693 percent in fiscal year 2007 sales volume in fiscal year 2008 exceeded that of fiscal year 2007 in all five geographic regions in which we operate largely driven by the advanced technology systems segment sales volume was up 217 percent in asia pacific 105 percent in europe 42 percent in japan 35 percent in the united states and 23 percent in the americas canada mexico and central and south america currency translation effects favorably impacted sales in all international regions 

 

operating profit  — cost of sales in fiscal year 2008 was 494394 up 124 percent from fiscal year 2007 due primarily to the increase in sales volume currency effects increased cost of sales by 31 percent gross margins expressed as a percent of sales increased to 560 percent in fiscal year 2008 from 557 percent in fiscal year 2007 the increase was the result of the absence of shortterm inventory purchase accounting adjustments related to acquisitions that reduced the fiscal year 2007 gross margin percentage by approximately 09 percent and favorable currency effects that increased the fiscal year 2008 gross margin rate by 04 percent offsetting these items were changes in product mix that reduced the gross margin percentage 

 

selling and administrative expenses excluding severance and restructuring costs were 434476 in fiscal year 2008 an increase of 33182 or 83 percent from fiscal year 2007 the increase is largely due to the first year effect of fiscal 2007 acquisitions which added 37 percent and currency translation effects which added 35 percent annual compensation increases and higher employee benefit costs also contributed to the increase selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to 386 percent in fiscal year 2008 from 404 percent in fiscal year 2007 reflecting ongoing operational improvement efforts and revenue increases that were supported by existing capacity 

 

in september 2008 nordson announced an acceleration of its ongoing operating margin improvement activities this acceleration effort involves a combination of nonworkforce related efficiencies and workforce reductions primarily in north america and europe with targeted annual savings of approximately 30000 in operating expenses by the end of fiscal year 2010 major areas of improvement include the streamlining of marketing and sales organizations optimization of engineering and information technology resources rationalization of products and continued integration of recent acquisitions we also expect to reduce exposure to certain underperforming markets it is anticipated that nonrecurring severance and related costs for implementation of these actions will total approximately 16000 with 5561 in charges occurring in 2008 and the remainder occurring in fiscal year 2009 the severance costs have been recorded in the corporate segment 

our operating profit margin increased to 169 percent in fiscal year 2008 from 153 percent in fiscal year 2007 purchase accounting adjustments for inventory associated with fiscal year 2007 acquisitions reduced that year’s operating profit margin by 09 percent the improvement was also due to favorable currency translation effects and revenue increases that were supported by existing capacity the operating profit margin was reduced by 05 percent as a result of the severance and restructuring costs described above 

 

segment operating profit margins in fiscal years 2008 and 2007 were as follows 

 

 

 

operating capacity for each of our segments can support fluctuations in order activity without significant changes in operating costs also currency translation affects reported operating profit margins operating profit margins for each segment were favorably impacted from a weaker dollar during the year as compared to the prior year 

 

operating profit margin for the adhesive dispensing systems segment was 250 percent up from 232 percent in fiscal year 2007 the increase can be traced to the increased sales volume across all product lines and geographic regions and to favorable currency translation effects 

 

operating profit margin for the advanced technology systems segment increased to 168 percent in fiscal year 2008 from 135 percent in fiscal year 2007 the increase was primarily the result of sales volume increasing at a higher rate than operating costs and the absence of the effect of shortterm purchase accounting adjustments related to fiscal year 2007 acquisitions partially offset by changes in sales mix 

 

operating profit margin for the industrial coating and automotive systems segment was 62 percent in fiscal year 2008 as compared to 96 percent in fiscal year 2007 the decrease in the operating profit margin is primarily due to a sales volume decrease of 75 percent and to a higher mix of lower margin system sales 

 

interest and other income expense  — interest expense in fiscal year 2008 was 16714 a decrease of 4828 or 224 percent from fiscal year 2007 due to lower borrowing levels and lower interest rates other income was 4914 in fiscal year 2008 compared to 3617 in fiscal year 2007 included in other income expense were currency gains of 2153 in fiscal year 2008 and currency losses of 1028 in fiscal year 2007 the prior year amount also included a 3038 gain on the saleleaseback of real estate 

 

income taxes  — nordson’s effective income tax rate on continuing operations was 346 percent in fiscal year 2008 up from 332 percent in fiscal year 2007 the increased rate is primarily due to a favorable adjustment in fiscal year 2007 related to a prior year tax revision 

 

net income  — income from continuing operations was 117504 or 343 per diluted share in fiscal year 2008 this compares to income from continuing operations of 90692 or 265 per diluted share in fiscal year 2007 this represents a 296 percent increase in income from continuing operations and a 294 percent increase in earnings per share from continuing operations 

 

recently issued accounting standards  — in june 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” fin 48 an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 “accounting for income taxes” fin 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertain income tax positions that are recognized in a company’s financial statements fin 48 also provides guidance on financial statement classification accounting for interest and penalties accounting for interim periods and new disclosure requirements as discussed in note 5 nordson adopted fin 48 as of november 1 2007 

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 157 “fair value measurements” fas 157 this statement provides a common definition of fair value and establishes a framework to make the measurement of fair value in generally accepted accounting principles more consistent and comparable it also requires expanded disclosures to provide information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities the methods and assumptions used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measures on earnings in february 2008 the fasb issued fsp fas 1572 effective date of fasb statement no 157 fsp fas 1572 which permits a oneyear deferral of the application of fas 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually fas 157 is effective for nordson as of november 1 2008 the adoption will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 

 

in february 2007 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities — including an amendment of fasb statement no 115” fas 159 this statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and report unrealized gains and losses on these instruments in earnings we will not elect the fair value measurement option for any of our existing financial instruments other than those that are already being measured at fair value as such the adoption of fas 159 on november 1 2008 will not have an impact on our results of operations or financial position 

 

in december 2007 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 141r “business combinations” fas 141r this statement provides greater consistency in the accounting and financial reporting of business combinations it requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction establishes the acquisitiondate fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed and requires the acquirer to disclose the nature and financial effect of the business combination nordson must adopt fas 141r for all business combinations subsequent to november 1 2009 the impact of adoption will depend on the nature and significance of any future acquisitions 

 

in december 2007 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements” fas 160 this statement amends accounting research bulletin no 51 “consolidated financial statements” to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary nordson must adopt fas 160 in fiscal year 2010 and has not yet determined the impact of adoption on its results of operations or financial position 

 

in march 2008 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 161 “disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 133” fas 161 this statement is intended to improve transparency in financial reporting by requiring enhanced disclosures of an entity’s derivative instruments and hedging activities and their effects on the entity’s financial position financial performance and cash flows fas 161 applies to all derivative instruments within the scope of fas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” as well as related hedged items bifurcated derivatives and nonderivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments entities with instruments subject to fas 161 must provide more robust qualitative disclosures and expanded quantitative disclosures nordson must adopt fas 161 on a prospective basis beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2009 with early application permitted we are currently evaluating the disclosure implications of this statement 

 

fiscal years 2007 and 2006 

sales  — worldwide sales for fiscal year 2007 were 993649 an increase of 114 percent from fiscal year 2006 sales of 892221 acquisitions accounted for 79 percentage points of the growth while sales volume of base businesses increased 01 percent favorable currency effects caused by the weaker us dollar increased sales by an additional 34 percent 

historically nordson reported results in three operating segments adhesive dispensing systems advanced technology systems and finishing and coating systems in the third quarter of fiscal year 2007 we announced an organizational restructuring in which the portion of the adhesive dispensing systems segment serving the automotive industry was combined with the finishing and coating systems segment to form the newly named industrial coating and automotive systems segment the operations of this segment are headquartered in amherst ohio are managed by the same executive and share certain resources engineering sales and factories prior fiscal year results have been reclassified to reflect the segment change 

 

all three segments reported higher sales volume in fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006 sales of the adhesive dispensing systems segment were 509568 in fiscal year 2007 an increase of 30710 or 64 percent from fiscal year 2006 sales volume was up 17 percent while currency effects increased reported sales by 47 percent the increase in sales volume can be traced to higher system sales in several geographic regions most notably asia pacific 

 

sales of the advanced technology systems segment were 300719 in fiscal year 2007 an increase of 61461 or 257 percent from fiscal year 2006 acquisitions generated a volume increase of 293 percent while sales volume of base businesses was down 50 percent favorable currency translation rates contributed 14 percent to sales growth within this segment sales within this segment were impacted by weakness in the semiconductor and electronic assembly markets 

 

industrial coating and automotive systems segment sales in fiscal year 2007 were 183362 an increase of 9257 or 53 percent from the prior year this increase can be traced to a volume increase of 27 percent and favorable currency effects of 26 percent the volume increase can be traced to higher system sales in japan and asia pacific 

 

it is estimated that the effect of pricing on total revenue was neutral relative to the prior fiscal year 

 

sales outside the united states accounted for 693 percent of total fiscal year 2007 sales up from 674 percent in fiscal year 2006 sales volume in fiscal year 2007 exceeded that the prior year in all five geographic regions largely driven by acquisitions sales volume was up 141 percent in japan 114 percent in the americas 113 percent in asia pacific 72 percent in europe and 47 percent in the united states currency effects favorably impacted sales in the americas asia pacific and europe regions but negatively impacted sales in japan 

 

operating profit  — cost of sales in fiscal year 2007 was 439804 up 158 percent from fiscal year 2006 due primarily to the increase in sales volume currency effects increased cost of sales by 28 percent gross margins expressed as a percent of sales decreased to 557 percent in fiscal year 2007 from 574 percent in fiscal year 2006 the fiscal year 2007 percentage was negatively impacted by shortterm inventory purchase accounting adjustments related to acquisitions that reduced the margin percentage by approximately 09 percent these adjustments were partially offset by favorable currency effects that increased the gross margin rate by 03 percent changes in product mix also contributed to the overall margin percentage decrease 

 

selling and administrative expenses excluding severance and restructuring costs were 401294 in fiscal year 2007 an increase of 39115 or 108 percent from fiscal year 2006 acquisitions and associated purchase accounting adjustments for property plant and equipment and intangible assets increased selling and administrative expenses by 69 percent and currency translation effects increased these expenses by 28 percent the remainder of the increase was largely due to higher compensation and product development costs selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to 404 percent in fiscal year 2007 from 406 percent in fiscal year 2006 reflecting ongoing operational improvement efforts and revenue increases that were supported by existing capacity 

 

our operating profit margin decreased to 153 percent in fiscal year 2007 from 165 percent in fiscal year 2006 purchase accounting adjustments for inventory property plant and equipment and intangible assets associated with fiscal year 2007 acquisitions reduced operating profit margin by 12 percent 

segment operating profit margins in fiscal years 2007 and 2006 were as follows 

 

 

 

operating capacity for each of our segments can support fluctuations in order activity without significant changes in operating costs also currency translation affects reported operating margins operating margins for each of our segments were favorably impacted from a weaker dollar during the year 

 

operating profit margin for the adhesive dispensing systems segment was 232 percent in fiscal year 2007 up from 228 percent in fiscal year 2006 the increase can be traced to the increased sales volume and to favorable currency translation effects in march 2007 nordson announced that it would close a manufacturing operation located in talladega alabama and move production activities to other nordson facilities that are closer to supplier locations total severance costs for the 36 affected employees will be approximately 541 and are being recorded over the future service period of april 2007 through march 2008 the expense amount recorded in fiscal year 2007 was 433 during fiscal year 2006 nordson realigned the management of the adhesive dispensing systems segment which resulted in the elimination of nine positions these actions better positioned the segment to achieve our growth objectives total costs recorded in fiscal year 2006 attributable to the position eliminations were 429 

 

operating profit margin for the advanced technology systems segment decreased to 135 percent in fiscal year 2007 from 238 percent in fiscal year 2006 the operating profit of this segment was impacted by approximately 11800 of purchase accounting adjustments for inventory property plant and equipment and intangible assets related to the fiscal year 2007 acquisitions in addition demand for our base products within this segment declined in fiscal year 2007 as capital spending in some of the end markets served by this segment was down from the prior year as customers reacted to capacity requirements and technology shifts since the decline in demand is viewed as a cyclical trend we continued to invest in new product development and distribution capacity for sustained longterm sales growth the reduced demand resulted in lower manufacturing overhead absorption causing lower operating profit margin for the year sales mix also contributed to the decrease in the operating profit margin from the prior year in an effort to improve efficiencies in operations serving the curing and drying market we eliminated 13 positions in the advanced technology systems segment during the second half of fiscal year 2006 total costs attributable to the position eliminations were 380 

 

operating profit margin for the industrial coating and automotive systems segment was 96 percent in fiscal year 2007 up from 59 percent in fiscal year 2006 the improvement in the operating profit margin is primarily due to sales volume increasing at a rate greater than operating costs in addition during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 nordson began a number of restructuring actions to improve performance and reduce costs in this segment these actions which included operational consolidations and approximately 60 personnel reductions were completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 as a result of these actions this segment now operates with lower costs and improved operating performance fiscal year 2006 results include 1818 of severance and restructuring costs 

 

interest and other income expense  — interest expense in fiscal year 2007 was 21542 an increase 9525 or 793 percent from fiscal year 2006 due to higher borrowing levels resulting from the four acquisitions made during fiscal year 2007 interest and investment income in fiscal year 2007 was 1505 down from 1867 in the prior year the prior year amount included income of 898 from an income tax refund other income was 3617 in fiscal year 2007 as opposed to other expense of 1031 in fiscal year 2006 the current year amount included a 3038 gain on the saleleaseback of real estate included in other income expense are currency losses of 1028 in fiscal year 2007 and 1796 in fiscal year 2006 

 

income taxes  — nordson’s effective income tax rate on continuing operations was 332 percent in fiscal year 2007 up from 284 percent in fiscal year 2006 the fiscal year 2006 rate reflects the approval by the joint committee on taxation of an income tax refund of approximately 3100 the increase in the effective tax rate is also due to higher tax rates on foreign income and a lower extraterritorial income exclusion 

net income  — income from continuing operations was 90692 or 265 per diluted share in fiscal year 2007 this compares to income from continuing operations of 97667 or 286 per diluted share in fiscal year 2006 this represents a 71 percent decrease in income from continuing operations and a 73 percent decrease in earnings per share from continuing operations net income including discontinued operations was 90598 or 265 per diluted share in fiscal year 2006 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash generated by operations in fiscal year 2008 was 114046 compared to 124248 in fiscal year 2007 the primary sources were net income adjusted for the addback of noncash expenses totaling 164197 compared to 124936 in fiscal year 2007 uses of cash from operating activities included 20922 associated with operating assets and liabilities compared to 7012 in fiscal year 2007 the primary reason for the change is a valuation decline in measurement funds underlying deferred compensation plans another reduction in cash relates to the difference in translated value of intercompany balances on foreign subsidiary books using average exchange rates and the corresponding balances on the parent company’s books using exchange rates in effect at the beginning and end of the fiscal year 

 

cash used by investing activities was 31924 in fiscal year 2008 compared to 348109 in fiscal year 2007 the prior year amount included 325245 of cash used for acquisitions capital expenditures were 26386 in fiscal year 2008 and were primarily associated with improvements to the efd building in east providence rhode island purchased in fiscal year 2007 global information systems and machinery and equipment in china 

 

cash of 102720 was used for financing activities in fiscal year 2008 compared to cash provided by financing activities of 202224 in fiscal year 2007 in fiscal year 2008 87276 of shortterm borrowings net was repaid and 24290 of scheduled longterm debt payments were made issuance of common shares related to employee benefit plans generated 16135 of cash dividend payments were 24645 in fiscal year 2008 an increase of 1164 from fiscal year 2007 due to an increase in the pershare amount of 43 percent from fiscal year 2007 in fiscal year 2007 net proceeds from shortterm borrowings of 281293 were used for four acquisitions 

 

the following is a summary of significant changes in balance sheet captions from the end of fiscal year 2007 to the end of fiscal year 2008 accounts payable decreased primarily due to the paydown of vendor invoices associated with the demand for inventory the decrease in income taxes payable is due to a tax benefit from the exercise of stock options reclassifications to other longterm liabilities resulting from the adoption of fin 48 and to tax payments related to current and prior year income intangible assets decreased as a result of amortization and currency rate changes the decrease in other noncurrent asserts was primarily caused by the lower market value of assets held in a rabbi trust related to a deferred compensation obligation the increase in longterm pension and retirement liabilities is due to a decrease in the fair value of plan assets partially offset by decreases in obligations from higher discount rates 

 

on february 22 2008 we entered into a note purchase and private shelf agreement the “agreement” with prudential investment management inc the agreement consists of a 50000 senior note and a 100000 private shelf facility the senior note bears interest at a rate of 498 percent and matures on february 22 2013 the agreement also contains customary events of default and covenants related to limitations on indebtedness and the maintenance of certain financial ratios we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants at october 31 2008 under the private shelf facility we may also borrow during the next three years unto 100000 at interest rates then in effect at the time of borrowing borrowings can be for up to 12 years with an average life not to exceed 10 years at october 31 2008 the amount we could borrow under the private shelf facility would not have been limited by any debt covenants 

 

the board of directors authorized nordson to repurchase up to 1000 of our common shares over a threeyear period beginning november 2006 the board of directors amended this resolution in august 2007 to permit us to enter into written agreements with independent third party brokers to purchase common shares on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions uses for repurchased shares include the funding of benefit programs including stock options restricted stock and 401k matching shares purchased are treated as treasury shares until used for such purposes the repurchase program is funded using working capital during fiscal year 2008 nordson repurchased 664 of the shares authorized to be repurchased under this program for 30678 

the following table summarizes obligations as of october 31 2008 

 

 

 

1 nordson has various lines of credit with both domestic and foreign banks at october 31 2008 these lines totaled 512470 of which 300409 was unused included in the total amount of 512470 was a 400000 unsecured multicurrency credit facility with a group of banks that expires in fiscal year 2012 this facility may be increased by 100000 to 500000 under certain conditions at october 31 2008 170000 was outstanding under this facility compared to 280000 outstanding at october 31 2007 there are two primary financial covenants that must be met under this facility the first covenant limits the amount of total indebtedness that can be incurred to 35 times consolidated trailing ebitda both indebtedness and ebitda as defined in the credit agreement the second covenant requires trailing consolidated trailing ebitda to be at least three times consolidated trailing interest expense both as defined in the credit agreement we were in compliance with all debt covenants at october 31 2008 

 

2 pension and postretirement plan funding amounts after fiscal year 2009 will be determined based on the future funded status of the plans and therefore cannot be estimated at this time 

 

we believe that the combination of present capital resources internally generated funds and unused financing sources are more than adequate to meet cash requirements for fiscal year 2009 there are no significant restrictions limiting the transfer of funds from international subsidiaries to the parent company 

 

outlook 

current disruptions in global financial markets and resulting turmoil in the general economic environment will have an impact on nordson’s performance however we believe we are well positioned to manage the impact upon our liquidity our liquidity needs arise from working capital requirements capital expenditures and principal and interest payments on indebtedness primary sources of liquidity to meet these needs are cash provided by operations and borrowings under our loan agreements cash provided by operations extending back to the end of the 2001 – 2002 recession ranged from 10 percent to 14 percent of net sales during the 2001 and 2002 recession years cash from operations were 10 percent and 20 percent of net sales respectively since the recession of 2001 – 2002 nordson has enhanced its sources of revenue by expanding its diversity of end markets and geographies into which it sells and also has employed lean practices into all areas of operations to gain cost efficiencies and improve operating margins and cash flow from operations in addition during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 we announced an acceleration of ongoing operational improvement activities as described above cash is available through a 400000 5year committed revolving line of credit with 12 domestic and international banks this line of credit was put into place in july 2007 and expires in july 2012 as of october 31 2008 we are in compliance with the financial covenants of this credit facility and have 230000 available borrowing capacity in addition in february 2008 nordson put in place a master shelf arrangement with the prudential insurance company to allow for the issuance of medium to longterm unsecured notes as of october 31 2008 we are in compliance with the financial covenant relating to a 50000 fiveyear note issued under this arrangement while these facilities provide the contractual terms for any borrowing we cannot be assured that these facilities would be available in the event of these financial institutions failure to remain sufficiently capitalized 

nordson’s priorities for fiscal year 2009 are focused upon the continuation of strategic actions to optimize revenue opportunities in a challenging economic environment and achieve its expectations for operational improvements through a combination of nonworkforce related efficiencies and workforce reductions major areas of improvement include the streamlining of marketing and sales organizations optimization of engineering and information technology resources rationalization of products and continued integration of recent acquisitions we also expect to reduce exposure to certain underperforming markets given the current economic challenges we expect this focus to result in optimized improvements in cash provided by operations 

 

with respect to spending the table above presents nordson’s financial obligations for the longterm being 391600 of which 108598 is payable in 2009 excluding amounts payable under terms of our revolving line of credit on december 10 2008 our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to 1000 shares over a threeyear period beginning december 22 2008 under this authorization the timing and actual number of shares subject to repurchase are at the discretion of management and are contingent on a number of factors including levels of cash generation from operations cash requirements for acquisitions repayment of debt and our share price capital expenditures for 2009 will be reduced from recent years and primarily focused upon our inprocess rollout of sap enterprise management software and various projects that improve manufacturing and distribution 

 

we will continue to look for strategic acquisition opportunities develop new applications and markets for our technologies and move forward with our initiatives to improve operating performance 

 

effects of foreign currency 

the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on sales and operating results cannot be precisely measured because of fluctuating selling prices sales volume product mix and cost structures in each country where we operate as a general rule a weakening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies has a favorable effect on sales and net income while a strengthening of the us dollar has a detrimental effect 

 

in fiscal year 2008 compared with fiscal year 2007 the us dollar was generally weaker against foreign currencies if fiscal year 2007 exchange rates had been in effect during fiscal year 2008 sales would have been approximately 43051 lower and thirdparty costs would have been approximately 27719 lower in fiscal year 2007 compared with fiscal year 2006 the us dollar was also generally weaker against foreign currencies if fiscal year 2006 exchange rates had been in effect during fiscal year 2007 sales would have been approximately 30261 lower and thirdparty costs would have been approximately 20807 lower these effects on reported sales do not include the impact of local price adjustments made in response to changes in currency exchange rates 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

nordson operates internationally and enters into intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies consequently we are subject to market risk arising from exchange rate movements between the dates foreign currencies are recorded and the dates they are settled we regularly use foreign exchange contracts to reduce our risks related to most of these transactions these contracts primarily euro british pound and yen usually have maturities of 90 days or less and generally require us to exchange foreign currencies for us dollars at maturity at rates stated in the contracts gains and losses from changes in the market value of these contracts offset foreign exchange losses and gains respectively on the underlying transactions other transactions denominated in foreign currencies are designated as hedges of nordson’s net investments in foreign subsidiaries or are intercompany transactions of a longterm investment nature as a result of the use of foreign exchange contracts on a routine basis to reduce the risks related to most of our transactions denominated in foreign currencies as of october 31 2008 we did not have a material foreign currency risk 

 

note 11 to the financial statements contains additional information about nordson’s foreign currency transactions and the methods and assumptions used to record these transactions 

 

a portion of our operations is financed with shortterm and longterm borrowings and is subject to market risk arising from changes in interest rates for longterm debt 

the tables that follow present principal repayments and related weightedaverage interest rates by expected maturity dates of fixedrate debt 

 

at october 31 2008 

 

 

nordson also has variablerate notes payable the weighted average interest rate of this debt was 37 percent at october 31 2008 and 53 percent at october 31 2007 a 1 percent increase in interest rates would have resulted in additional interest expense of approximately 2431 on the notes payable in fiscal year 2008 

inflation 

inflation affects profit margins because the ability to pass cost increases on to customers is restricted by the need for competitive pricing although inflation has been modest in recent years and has had no material effect on the years covered by these financial statements we continue to seek ways to minimize the impact of inflation through focused efforts to raise productivity 

 

trends 

the fiveyear summary in item 6 documents nordson’s historical financial trends over this period the world’s economic conditions fluctuated significantly our solid performance is attributed to our participation in diverse geographic and industrial markets and our longterm commitment to develop and provide quality products and worldwide service to meet customers’ changing needs

intellectual property the company maintains procedures to protect its intellectual property including patents trademarks and copyrights both domestically and internationally risk factors associated with the company’s intellectual property are discussed in item 1a risk factors 

seasonal variation in business generally the highest volume of sales occurs in the company’s fourth fiscal quarter due in large part to the timing of large engineered systems shipments firstquarter sales volume is normally the lowest of the year due to customer holiday shutdowns 

working capital practices no special or unusual practices affect nordson’s working capital however the company generally requires advance payments as deposits on customized equipment and systems and in certain cases requires progress payments during the manufacturing of these products the company has initiated a number of new business processes focused on reduction of manufacturing lead times these initiatives have resulted in lower investment in inventory while maintaining the capability to respond promptly to customer needs 

customers the company serves a broad customer base both in terms of industries and geographic regions the loss of a single or few customers would not have a material adverse effect on the company’s business in fiscal 2006 no single customer accounted for 5 percent or more of sales 

backlog the company’s backlog of open orders from continuing operations decreased to 68637 at october 31 2006 from 73845 at october 30 2005 the decrease can be traced primarily to the advanced technology segment all orders in the fiscal 2006 yearend backlog are expected to be shipped to customers in fiscal 2007 

government contracts nordson’s business neither includes nor depends upon a significant amount of governmental contracts or subcontracts therefore no material part of the company’s business is subject to renegotiation or termination at the option of the government 

competitive conditions nordson equipment is sold in competition with a wide variety of alternative bonding sealing caulking finishing and coating techniques any production process that requires the application of material to a substrate or surface is a potential use for nordson equipment 

many factors influence the company’s competitive position including pricing product quality and service nordson enjoys a leadership position in the competitive industrial application systems business by delivering highquality innovative products and technologies as well as afterthesale service and technical support working with customers to understand their processes and developing the application solutions that help them meet their production requirements also contributes to nordson’s leadership position nordson’s worldwide network of direct sales and technical resources also is a competitive advantage 

research and development investments in research and development are important to nordson’s longterm growth because they enable the company to keep pace with changing customer and marketplace needs and they help to sustain sales improvements year after year the company places strong emphasis on technology developments and improvements through its internal engineering and research teams research and development expenses related to continuing operations were approximately 24467 in fiscal 2006 compared with approximately 20946 in fiscal 2005 and 22016 in fiscal 2004 

environmental compliance we are subject to extensive federal state local and foreign environmental safety and health laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to land and water and the generation handling treatment and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials under certain of these laws we can be held strictly liable for hazardous substance contamination of any real property we have ever owned operated or used as a disposal site or for natural resource damages associated with such contamination we are also required to maintain various related permits and licenses many of which require periodic modification and renewal the operation of manufacturing plants unavoidably entails environmental safety and health risks and we could incur material unanticipated costs or liabilities in the future if any of these risks were realized in ways or to an extent that we did not anticipate 

6 we believe that we operate in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations compliance with environmental laws and regulations requires continuing management effort and expenditures we have incurred and will continue to incur costs and capital expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations and to obtain and maintain the necessary permits and licenses we believe that the cost of complying with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material affect on our earnings liquidity or competitive position but we cannot assure that material compliancerelated costs and expenses may not arise in the future for example future adoption of new or amended environmental laws regulations or requirements or newly discovered contamination or other circumstances that require a response on our part may require us to incur costs and expenses that we cannot presently anticipate we believe that we have properly designed our policies practices and procedures to prevent unreasonable risk of material environmental damage arising from our operations we accrue for estimated environmental liabilities with charges to expense we believe our environmental accrual is adequate to provide for our portion of the costs of all such known environmental liabilities except for the disclosure in item 3 legal proceedings compliance with federal state and local environmental protection laws during fiscal 2006 had no material effect on the company’s capital expenditures earnings or competitive position based upon consideration of currently available information we believe liabilities for environmental matters will not have a material adverse affect on our financial position operating results or liquidity but we cannot assure that material environmental liabilities may not arise in the future

 item 1a risk factors in an enterprise as diverse and complex as nordson’s a wide range of factors could affect future performance we discuss in this section some of the risk factors that if they actually occurred could materially and adversely affect the company’s business financial condition value and results of operations you should consider these risk factors in connection with evaluating the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k because these factors could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected in forwardlooking statements the risks that we highlight below are not the only ones that we face additional risks and uncertainties that the company does not presently know about or that the company currently believes will be immaterial may also affect the company’s business 7 in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in this report the significant risk factors affecting our operations include the following 

changes in us or international economic conditions could adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses 

in 2006 33 percent of the company’s revenue was derived from domestic operations while 67 percent was derived from international operations the company’s largest markets include appliance automotive bookbinding container converting electronics food and beverage furniture life sciences medical metal finishing nonwovens packaging and semiconductor a slowdown in any of these specific end markets could directly affect the company’s revenue stream and profitability 

a portion of our product sales is attributable to industries and markets such as the semiconductor and metal finishing industries which historically have been cyclical and sensitive to relative changes in supply and demand and general economic conditions the demand for our products depends in part on the general economic conditions of the industries or national economies of our customers downward economic cycles in our customers’ industries or countries may reduce sales of some of our products it is not possible to predict accurately the factors that will affect demand for our products in the future 

any significant downturn in the health of the general economy either globally regionally or in the markets in which we sell products could have an adverse effect on our revenues and financial performance 

political conditions in foreign countries in which we operate could adversely affect us 

the company conducts its manufacturing sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and is subject to risks associated with doing business outside the united states in the year ended october 31 2006 approximately 67 percent of our total sales were to customers outside the us we expect that international operations and us export sales will continue to be important to our business for the foreseeable future both the sales from international operations and us export sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside the united states such risks include but are not limited to the following 

 any of these events could reduce the demand for our products limit the prices at which we can sell our products or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operating performance 

8 the inability to continue to develop new products could limit the company’s revenue and profitability innovation is critical to the company’s success we believe that we must continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and manufacture new products with improved capabilities in order to continue to be a market leader we also believe that we must continue to make improvements in our productivity in order to maintain our competitive position our inability to anticipate respond to or utilize changing technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated results of operations 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions and we may not be able to make acquisitions of suitable candidates or integrate acquisitions successfully our recent historical growth has also depended and our future growth is likely to continue to depend in large part on our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses into our existing operations we intend to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world we cannot assure however that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates prevail against competing potential acquirers negotiate appropriate acquisition terms obtain financing that may be needed to consummate such acquisitions complete proposed acquisitions successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new markets in addition we cannot assure that any acquisition once successfully integrated will perform as planned be accretive to earnings or prove to be beneficial to our operations and cash flow 

the success of any acquisition is subject to other risks and uncertainties including  in addition an acquisition could adversely impact the company’s results of operations by causing the company to incur debt or requiring the amortization of acquisition expenses and acquired assets we may also face liability with respect to acquired businesses for violations under environmental laws occurring prior to the date of our acquisition and some or all of these liabilities may not be covered by environmental insurance secured to mitigate the risk or by indemnification from the sellers from which we acquired these businesses we could incur significant costs including cleanup costs natural resources damages civil or criminal fines and sanctions and thirdparty claims as a result of past or future violations of or liabilities under environmental laws significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates or change in monetary policy may harm our financial results we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly with respect to the euro and the yen any significant change in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business against the us dollar could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for additional detail related to this risk see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

9 the majority of our consolidated revenues in 2006 were generated in currencies other than the us dollar which is our reporting currency we recognize foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from our operations in the period incurred as a result currency fluctuations between the us dollar and the currencies in which we do business have caused and will continue to cause foreign currency transaction gains and losses which historically have been material and could continue to be material we cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future operating results because of the number of currencies involved the variability of currency exposures and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates we take actions to manage our foreign currency exposure such as entering into hedging transactions where available but we cannot assure that our strategies will adequately protect our consolidated operating results from the effects of exchange rate fluctuations we also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls currency devaluations diminish the value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation and if they occur or continue for significant periods could adversely affect our earnings or cash flow inability to access capital could impede growth the limits imposed on us by the restrictive covenants contained in our credit facilities could prevent us from making acquisitions or capital improvements or cause us to lose access to these facilities 

our existing credit facilities contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to among other things  in addition our credit facilities require us to meet financial ratios including debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit facility and consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit facility to interest expense these restrictions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs and could otherwise restrict our financing activities our ability to comply with the covenants and other terms of our credit facilities will depend on our future operating performance if we fail to comply with such covenants and terms we will be in default and the maturity of the related debt could be accelerated and become immediately due and payable we may be required to obtain waivers from our lenders in order to maintain compliance under our credit facilities including waivers with respect to our compliance with certain financial covenants if we are unable to obtain any necessary waivers and the debt under our credit facilities is accelerated our financial condition would be adversely affected we may need new or additional financing in the future to expand our business or refinance existing indebtedness if we are unable to access capital on satisfactory terms and conditions we may not be able to expand our business or meet our payment requirements under our existing credit facilities our ability to obtain new or additional financing will depend on a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control we may not be able to obtain new or additional financing because we have substantial debt or because we may not have sufficient cash flow to service or repay our existing or future debt in addition depending on market conditions and our financial performance equity financing may not be available on satisfactory terms or at all we could be adversely affected if our debt is downgraded 10 we could be adversely affected by rapid changes in interest rates any period of unexpected or rapid increase in interest rates may also adversely affect our profitability at october 31 2006 we had 117318 of total debt outstanding of which approximately 14 percent was priced at interest rates that float with the market a 1 percent increase in the interest rate on the floating rate debt in 2006 would have resulted in approximately 171 of additional interest expense a higher level of debt would increase the exposure discussed above for additional detail related to this risk see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

our inability to protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect product sales and financial performance difficulties in acquiring and maintaining a proprietary intellectual ownership position could also adversely affect the company’s business and financial position our performance may depend in part on our ability to establish protect and enforce intellectual property rights with respect to our patented technologies and proprietary rights and to defend against any claims of infringement which involves complex legal scientific and factual questions and uncertainties the company’s ability to compete effectively with other companies depends in part on its ability to maintain and enforce the company’s patents and other proprietary rights which are essential to its business these measures afford only limited protection and competitors may gain access to the company’s intellectual property and proprietary information the law of patents and trade secrets is constantly evolving and often involves complex legal and factual questions 

litigation has been and may continue to be necessary to enforce the company’s intellectual property rights to protect the company’s trade secrets and to determine the validity and scope of the company’s proprietary rights in addition we may face claims of infringement that could interfere with our ability to use technology or other intellectual property rights that are material to our business operations if litigation that we initiate is unsuccessful we may not be able to protect the value of some of our intellectual property in the event a claim of infringement against us is successful we may be required to pay royalties or license fees to continue to use technology or other intellectual property rights that we have been using or we may be unable to obtain necessary licenses from third parties at a reasonable cost or within a reasonable time if we are unable to obtain licenses on reasonable terms we may be forced to cease selling or using any of our products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property or to redesign or in the case of trademark claims rename our products to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties which may not be possible and if possible may be time consuming any litigation of this type whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs to us and diversions of some of our resources our intellectual property rights may not have the value we believe them to have which could result in a competitive disadvantage or adversely affect our business and financial performance this form 10k particularly “management’s discussion and analysis” contains forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the securities act of 1933 as amended the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended and the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 such statements relate to among other things income earnings cash flows changes in operations operating improvements businesses in which nordson corporation operates and the us and global economies statements in this 10k that are not historical are hereby identified as “forwardlooking statements” and may be indicated by words or phrases such as “anticipates” “supports” “plans” “projects” “expects” “believes” “should” “would” “could” “hope” “forecast” “management is of the opinion” use of the future tense and similar words or phrases in light of these risks and uncertainties actual events and results may vary significantly from those included in or contemplated or implied by such statements readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forwardlooking statements these forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date made the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise except as required by law 11 the company may from time to time post financial or other information on its web site httpwwwnordsoncom investors  the internet address is for informational purposes only and is not intended for use as a hyperlink the company is not incorporating any material on its web site into this report

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend in this annual report all amounts related to us and foreign currency and to the number of shares of nordson corporation common shares except for per share earnings and dividend amounts are expressed in thousands amounts in the consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended october 30 2005 and october 31 2004 have been reclassified to conform to the presentation used in 2006 see note 3 “discontinued operations” to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the reclassification of financial information for discontinued operations 

critical accounting policies and estimates the company’s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires the company’s management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses on an ongoing basis the company evaluates the accounting policies and estimates it uses to prepare financial statements the company bases its estimates on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates used by management 

certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to the company’s results of operations or financial position are discussed below on a regular basis the company reviews critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors revenue recognition  — most of the company’s revenues are recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the sales price is fixed or determinable collectibility is reasonably assured and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer revenues from contracts with multiple element arrangements such as those including installation or other services are recognized as each element is earned based on objective evidence of the relative fair value of each element if the installation or other services are inconsequential to the functionality of the delivered product the entire amount of revenue is recognized upon transfer of ownership inconsequential installation or other services are those that can generally be completed in a short period of time at insignificant cost and the skills required to complete these installations are not unique to the company if installation or other services are essential to the functionality of the delivered product revenues attributable to these obligations are deferred until completed amounts received in excess of revenue recognized are included as deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheets revenues deferred in 2006 2005 and 2004 were not material a limited number of the company’s large engineered systems sales contracts were accounted for using the percentageofcompletion method the amount of revenue recognized in any accounting period was based on the ratio of actual costs incurred through the end of the period to total estimated costs at completion cost estimates were updated on a quarterly basis during 2006 no revenues were recognized under the percentageofcompletion method during 2005 and 2004 the company recognized revenue of approximately 5000 and 7000 respectively under this method these revenues have been reclassified to discontinued operations goodwill  — goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired at october 31 2006 and october 30 2005 goodwill represented 40 percent and 42 percent respectively of the company’s total assets the majority of the goodwill resulted from the acquisition of efd inc in fiscal 2001 in accordance with fasb statement no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level or more often if indications of impairment exist the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined by applying appropriate discount rates to estimated future cash flows and terminal value amounts for the reporting units the results of the company’s analyses indicated that no reduction of goodwill is required 18 inventories  — inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market cost has been determined using the lastin firstout lifo method for 37 percent of the company’s consolidated inventories at october 31 2006 and 35 percent at october 30 2005 with the firstin firstout fifo method used for the remaining inventory on an ongoing basis the company tests its inventory for technical obsolescence as well as for future demand and changes in market conditions the company has historically maintained inventory reserves to reflect those conditions when the cost of inventory is not expected to be recovered the company also maintains inventory reserves for inventory used for demonstration purposes amounts expensed related to inventory reserves were 2210 2896 and 4421 in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the reserve balance was 7499 7126 and 7139 at the end of 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively pension plans and postretirement medical plan  — the measurement of liabilities related to the company’s pension plans and postretirement medical plan is based on management’s assumptions related to future factors including interest rates return on pension plan assets compensation increases mortality and turnover assumptions and health care cost trend rates the weightedaverage discount rate used to determine the present value of the company’s domestic pension plan obligations was 60 percent at october 31 2006 compared to 58 percent at october 30 2005 the discount rate for these plans which comprised 79 percent of the worldwide pension obligations at october 31 2006 was based on quality fixed income investments with a duration period approximately equal to the period over which pension obligations are expected to be settled the weightedaverage discount rate used to determine the present value of the company’s various international pension plan obligations was 43 percent at october 31 2006 compared to 42 percent at october 30 2005 the discount rates used for the international plans were determined by using quality fixed income investments in determining the expected return on plan assets the company considers both historical performance and an estimate of future longterm rates of return on assets similar to those in the company’s plans the company consults with and considers the opinions of financial and other professionals in developing appropriate return assumptions the expected rate of return longterm investment rate on domestic pension assets was 85 percent in both 2006 and 2005 the average expected rate of return on international pension assets decreased to 54 percent in 2006 from 57 percent in 2005 the assumed rate of compensation increases for domestic employees was 33 percent in 2006 the same as 2005 the assumed rate of compensation increases for international employees was 31 percent in 2006 also the same as 2005 annual expense amounts are determined based on the discount rate used at the end of the prior year differences between actual and assumed investment returns on pension plan assets result in actuarial gains or losses that are amortized into expense over a period of years with respect to the domestic postretirement medical plan the discount rate used to value the benefit obligation increased from 58 percent at october 30 2005 to 60 percent at october 31 2006 the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the health care cost trend rate is assumed to be 9 percent in 2007 decreasing gradually to 5 percent in 2011 the health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported for example a onepercentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects  employees hired after january 1 2002 are not eligible to participate in the domestic postretirement medical plan the company expects that pension and postretirement expenses in fiscal 2007 will be approximately 1000 lower than fiscal 2006 primarily reflecting changes in actuarial assumptions 19 financial instruments  — assets liabilities and commitments that are to be settled in cash and are denominated in foreign currencies are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates the company enters into foreign currency forward contracts which are derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of foreign currency exposures resulting from the collection of receivables payables and loans denominated in foreign currencies the maturities of these contracts are usually less than 90 days forward contracts are marked to market each accounting period and the resulting gains or losses are included in other income expense on the consolidated statement of income 

warranties  — the company provides customers with a product warranty that requires the company to repair or replace defective products within a specified period of time generally one year from the date of delivery or first use an accrual is recorded for expected warranty costs for products shipped through the end of each accounting period in determining the amount of the accrual the company relies primarily on historical warranty claims by product sold amounts charged to the warranty reserve were 6092 4090 and 3732 in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the reserve balance was 4917 3989 and 3601 at the end of 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

longterm incentive compensation plan ltip  — under the longterm incentive compensation plan executive officers and selected other employees receive cash or stock awards based solely on corporate performance measures over threeyear performance periods awards vary based on the degree to which corporate performance equals or exceeds predetermined threshold target and maximum performance levels at the end of a performance period no payout will occur unless the company equals or exceeds certain threshold performance objectives 

under the performance periods originating in 2004 and 2005 awards will be paid in cash based upon the share price of the company’s common shares at a predetermined date subsequent to the end of each threeyear performance period over each threeyear performance period costs are accrued based upon current performance projections for the threeyear period and the percentage of the requisite service that has been rendered along with changes in value of the company’s common shares the method of estimating accrual amounts was revised upon adoption of fas 123r however the cumulative effect of the change was not material the accruals for these performance periods continue to be classified as liabilities at october 31 2006 the liability for the plans originating in 2004 and 2005 was 8596 

under the performance period originating in 2006 awards will be settled in common shares the amount of compensation expense is based upon current performance projections for the threeyear period and the percentage of the requisite service that has been rendered the calculation is also based upon the weightedaverage value of the company’s common stock at the dates of grant these awards are recorded in shareholders’ equity the amount recorded at october 31 2006 was 1590 

compensation expense attributable to the ltip was 5456 in 2006 4237 for 2005 and 7004 for 2004 

discontinued operations 

on october 13 2006 the company entered into an agreement to sell its fiber systems group to saurer ltd for 5966 the fiber systems group was acquired in 1998 as part of the acquisition of jm laboratories as a means of expanding the adhesive dispensing systems segment however due to the changing competitive environment the fiber systems group did not meet the company’s financial performance objectives the sale will enable the company to concentrate its activities on better performing or fastergrowing businesses proceeds of 5411 were received on the closing date with the remaining 555 to be paid over an 18month period following the closing date in accordance with fasb statement of accounting standards no 144 the results of this business have been classified as discontinued operations accordingly the revenues costs and expenses assets and liabilities and cash flows of this business have been segregated in the consolidated statement of income consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of cash flows

the company is organized into three business segments adhesive dispensing systems advanced technology systems and finishing and coating systems all three reported higher sales volume in 2006 compared to 2005 sales of the adhesive segment were 507959 in 2006 an increase of 13277 or 27 percent from 2005 sales volume was up 45 percent while currency effects reduced reported sales by 18 percent all

sales volume increased 201 percent while currency effects reduced sales by 04 percent within this segment the asymtek business was especially strong with efd and uv curing sales volume also increasing significantly finishing and coating segment sales in 2006 were 145004 an increase of 7314 or 53 percent from the prior year this increase can be traced to a volume increase of 64 percent offset by negative currency effects of 11 percent volume increases were seen in all businesses within this segment with liquid system sales being particularly strong it is estimated that the effect of pricing on total revenue was neutral relative to the prior year nordson’s sales outside the united states accounted for 674 percent of total 2006 sales up slightly from 665 percent in 2005 sales volume in 2006 exceeded that of 2005 in all five geographic regions with the largest increase generated in the asia pacific region where sales volume increased 274 percent sales volume was up 44 percent in the united states 68 percent in the americas 76 percent in europe and 38 percent in japan these increases can be traced largely to the advanced technology segment operating profit  — cost of sales in 2006 was 379800 up 47 percent from 2005 due primarily to a volume increase of 55 percent offset by currency effects that reduced cost of sales by 08 percent gross margins expressed as a percent of sales increased to 574 percent in 2006 from 564 percent in 2005 the increase was driven by favorable product mix and productivity improvements currency effects reduced the margin rate by approximately 03 percent selling and administrative expenses were 362179 in 2006 an increase of 24397 or 72 percent from 2005 the increase is primarily due to compensation increases and higher employee benefit costs other charges totaling 6510 for stock option expense and for remediation costs related to a wisconsin landfill also impacted 2006 selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses were 406 percent of sales in both 2006 and 2005 reflecting ongoing lean efforts and revenue increases that were supported by existing capacity currency effects reduced selling and administrative expenses by 10 percent 21 effective in 2006 the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of fas 123r using the modified prospective transition method resulting in stock option expenses of 3675 for the year under the modified prospective transition method compensation costs in 2006 include cost for options granted prior to but not vested as of october 31 2005 and unvested options granted in 2006 compensation expense is being recognized in selling and administrative expenses on a straightline basis over the total requisite service period of each option grant prior to 2006 the company accounted for its stock options under the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” no stock option expense was reflected in net income as all options granted under these plans had an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying common shares on the date of grant results for prior periods have not been restated as of october 31 2006 there was 5553 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options that cost is expected to be amortized over a weighted average period of approximately 14 years the company has voluntarily agreed with the city of new richmond wisconsin and other potentially responsible parties “prp” to share costs associated with 1 a feasibility study and remedial investigation “fsri” for remediation of the city of new richmond municipal landfill the “site” and 2 providing clean drinking water to the affected residential properties down gradient of the site the prp group has agreed to an allocation that sets the company’s share of the cost of remediation at 5635 percent the fs ri was completed and submitted to the wisconsin department of natural resources “wdnr” in july 2006 the total cost of the company’s share for remediation efforts site and clean drinking water will not be ascertainable until a remediation plan is approved by the wdnr approval is not anticipated to occur before the second quarter of fiscal 2007 however based upon the range of viable alternatives for site remediation and providing clean drinking water to residences down gradient of the site submitted as part of the feasibility study the company recorded 2835 of expense in the third quarter of 2006 its best estimate of its obligation with respect to remediation of the site and providing clean drinking water to residences down gradient of the site if the site remediation takes longer than expected and clean drinking water must be

better positioned the segment to achieve its growth objectives total costs attributed to the position eliminations were 429 of which 398 was paid in 2006 the remaining 31 will be paid in 2007 sales volume of the advanced technology segment improved at a rate greater than operating costs resulting in an increase in the operating profit percentage as a result of a slowdown in customer demand in the uv curing business within the advanced technology segment the company eliminated 13 positions in the second half of 2006 total severance costs of 380 were paid in 2006 22 the improvement in the finishing and coating segment operating profit is primarily due to sales volume increasing at a rate greater than operating costs in addition during the fourth quarter of 2005 the company announced a number of restructuring actions to improve performance and reduce costs in its finishing and coating segment these actions which included operational consolidations and approximately 60 personnel reductions were completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 as a result of these actions resources are more effectively aligned with shifting patterns of global demands enabling the segment to

borrowing levels interest and investment income in 2006 was 1867 up from 1826 in the prior year interest income of 898 on an income tax refund in 2006 was offset by lower interest income from cash equivalents and marketable securities other expense was 1031 in 2006 as opposed to other income of 1586 in 2005 included in these amounts were currency losses of 1796 in 2006 and 705 in 2005 net income  — the company’s effective income tax rate on continuing operations was 284 percent in 2006 down from 297 percent in 2005 the 2006 rate reflects the approval by the joint committee on taxation of an income tax refund of approximately 3100 which was treated as a discrete event in the third quarter the 2005 tax rate was impacted by the reversal of a valuation allowance on foreign tax credits of 7367 offset somewhat by a lower extraterritorial income exclusion and a higher state income tax provision net income from continuing operations was 97667 or 286 per diluted share in 2006 this compares to net income from continuing operations of 84510 or 231 per diluted share in 2005 this represents a 156 percent increase in income from continuing operations and a 238 percent increase in

additional 21 percent to the overall sales gain 

sales of the adhesive segment were 494682 in 2005 an increase of 19077 or 40 percent from 2004 currency effects added 26 percent to reported sales with the remainder of the increase due to a sales volume increase of 14 percent within this segment lower nonwoven system sales were partially offset by increases in the core packaging and product assembly businesses sales of the advanced technology segment were 199807 in 2005 an increase of 34906 or 212 percent from 2004 substantially all of the increase was the result of volume gains within this segment the asymtek and march plasma businesses were especially strong with volume up more than 33 percent in the aggregate from 2004 efd sales volume also increased finishing and coating segment sales in 2005 were 137690 compared with 130944 in the prior year the 52 percent increase can be traced to a volume increase of 31 percent combined with currency effects of 21 percent the volume increase was due to strong container system sales across all geographic regions partially offset by a decrease in liquid system sales it is estimated that the effect of pricing on total revenue was neutral relative to the prior year nordson’s sales outside the united states accounted for 665 percent of total 2005 sales up slightly from 657 percent in 2004 sales volume was up 54 percent in the united states 187 percent in asia pacific 162 percent in the americas and 66 percent in japan these increases can be traced largely to the advanced technology segment european sales volume was flat compared to 2004 operating profit  — cost of sales in 2005 was 362824 up 85 percent from 2004 due primarily to a volume increase of 72 percent and currency effects that added 13 percent gross margins expressed as a percent of sales decreased to 564 percent in 2005 from 567 percent in 2004 selling and administrative expenses were 337782 in 2005 an increase of 19220 or 60 percent from 2004 the increase is due to currency translation effects of 19 percent and to compensation increases and higher employee benefit costs as a percent of sales these costs decreased to 406 percent in 2005 from 413 percent in 2004 operating profit margins expressed as a percent of sales were 157 percent in 2005 compared to 154 percent in 2004 segment operating profit margins in 2005 and 2004 were as follows  operating capacity for each of our segments can support increases or decreases in order activity without significant changes in operating costs also currency translation affects reported operating margins operating margins for each of our segments benefited from a weaker dollar during the year sales volume of the advanced technology segment improved at a rate greater than operating costs resulting in an increase in the operating profit percentage 25 the finishing and coating segment experienced improved sales volume but also higher operating costs due in part to restructuring activity during the fourth quarter of 2005 the company announced a number of restructuring actions to improve performance and reduce costs in its finishing and coating segment as a result of these actions resources are more effectively aligned with shifting patterns of global demands enabling the segment to operate both with lower costs and better capability to serve customers in the faster growing emerging markets costs of 875 were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005 interest and other  — interest expense in 2005 was 13825 a decrease of 104 percent from 2004 due to lower borrowing levels interest and investment income in 2005 was 1826 up from 1192 in the prior year due to higher levels of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities other income was 1586 in 2005 as opposed to other expense of 2685 in 2004 included in these amounts were currency losses of 705 in 2005 and 326 in 2004 in 2004 other expenses included a loss of 3288 on the disposition of a minority equity investment net income  — the company’s effective income tax rate on continuing operations was 297 percent in 2005 down from 328 percent in 2004 the decrease was primarily due to the reversal of a valuation allowance on foreign tax credits of 7367 offset somewhat by a lower extraterritorial income exclusion and a higher state income tax provision net income from continuing operations was 84510 or 231 per diluted share in 2005 this compares to net income from continuing operations of 68307 or 187 per diluted share in 2004 this represents a 24 percent increase in both income and earnings per share from continuing operations liquidity capital expenditures and sources of capital cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2006 were 48859 an increase of 37541 from the end of 2005 the 2005 yearend balance was impacted by the repurchase of approximately 10 percent of the company’s outstanding common shares in a september 2005 transaction 

cash generated by operations in 2006 was 120024 up from 118458 last year the increase was due to higher net income offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities the increase in yearend receivables is traced to higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to 2005 the 2006 yearend receivable balance also included approximately 4000 related to an income tax refund and related interest an increase in accrued liabilities accounted for 6801 of cash provided by operations and was largely due to higher incentive compensation and donation accruals the reduction in current deferred taxes in 2006 related primarily to employee benefit accruals and the increase in longterm deferred tax assets related primarily to employee benefit accruals and to accruals not currently deductible offset by amortization of goodwill other noncurrent assets increased due to the funding of a deferred compensation obligation within longterm liabilities pension and retirement obligations decreased as a result of plan funding and other liabilities increased primarily due to higher deferred compensation in addition there was a 9074 use of cash from operations traced to a change in the presentation of tax benefits from the exercise of stock options whereby prior to the adoption of fas 123r the company presented the tax benefit of deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options as operating cash flows in the statement of cash flows fas 123r requires the reclassification of the benefit associated with capital in excess of stated value as financing cash flows cash used by investing activities was 7195 in 2006 compared to cash provided by investing activities of 33565 in 2005 the change was due to the sale of auction rate and variable rate demand obligation securities in 2005 capital expenditures which were concentrated on information systems and production equipment were 13610 cash of 5411 was generated from the sale of the fiber systems group cash used for financing activities in 2006 was 77968 principal uses of cash were 54004 for scheduled repayments of longterm debt 22521 for the repurchase of the company’s common shares and 22372 for dividend payments to shareholders total dividend payments decreased 1006 from 2005 due to a lower number of shares outstanding the pershare amount increased 39 percent from 2005 issuance of common shares related to the exercise of stock options generated 21535 of cash 26 discontinued operations  — cash flows from discontinued operations are presented separately on a single line in each section of the consolidated statement of cash flows the absence of future cash flows from discontinued operations is not expected to materially affect future liquidity and capital resources 

the following table summarizes the company’s obligations as of october 31 2006 

 pension and postretirement plan funding amounts after 2007 will be determined based on the future funded status of the plans and therefore cannot be estimated at this time 

nordson has various lines of credit with both domestic and foreign banks at october 31 2006 these lines totaled 268157 of which 252259 was unused included in the total amount of 268157 was a 200000 facility with a group of banks that expires in 2009 this facility was increased from 200000 to 300000 on december 8 2006 and may be increased to 400000 under certain conditions this facility was unused at the end of 2006 there are two covenants that the company must meet under this facility the first covenant limits the amount of additional debt the company can incur at the end of 2006 this covenant would not have limited the amount the company could borrow under this facility the other covenant requires ebit as defined in the credit agreement to be at least three times interest expense the actual interest coverage was 112 for 2006 the company was in compliance with all debt covenants at october 31 2006 

on december 14 2006 the company announced that it had acquired dage holdings limited a leading manufacturer of testing and inspection equipment used in the semiconductor and printed circuit board industries dage headquartered in the united kingdom employs more than 200 people and had revenues of approximately 59000 during the 12month period ending october 31 2006 the purchase price was approximately great britain pounds 117006 approximately 230000 subject to certain postclosing adjustments cash and existing lines of credit were used for the purchase 

the company believes that the combination of present capital resources internally generated funds and unused financing sources are more than adequate to meet cash requirements for 2007 there are no significant restrictions limiting the transfer of funds from international subsidiaries to the parent company 

in october 2003 the board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to 2000 of the company’s common shares on the open market uses for repurchased shares include the funding of benefit programs including stock options restricted stock and 401k matching shares purchased are treated as treasury shares until used for such purposes the repurchase program is funded using the company’s working capital during 2006 the company repurchased 423 of the shares authorized to be repurchased under this program in october 2006 the board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to 1000 of the company’s common shares on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions over a threeyear period 

27 outlook the company has recently taken two strategic actions that will add value in 2007 and beyond the first was the sale of the fiber systems group in the fourth quarter of 2006 the absence of the operating losses from this business will improve ongoing earnings per share the second strategic action was the december 14 2006 acquisition of dage holdings limited dage operates two principle product lines used to analyze the integrity of electronic connections in semiconductor packages and printed circuit board assemblies revenues for the 12 months ended october 31 2006 were approximately 59000 this acquisition is expected to be moderately accretive to the company’s 2007 earnings per share 

effects of foreign currency the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on sales and operating results cannot be precisely measured because of fluctuating selling prices sales volume product mix and cost structures in each country where nordson operates as a rule a weakening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies has a favorable effect on sales and net income while a strengthening of the us dollar has a detrimental effect 

in 2006 compared with 2005 the us dollar was generally stronger against foreign currencies if 2005 exchange rates had been in effect during 2006 sales would have been approximately 11161 higher and thirdparty costs would have been approximately 6535 higher in 2005 compared with 2004 the us dollar was generally weaker against foreign currencies if 2004 exchange rates had been in effect during 2005 sales would have been approximately 16510 lower and thirdparty costs would have been approximately 10618 lower these effects on reported sales do not include the impact of local price adjustments made in response to changes in currency exchange rates 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company operates internationally and enters into transactions denominated in foreign currencies consequently the company is subject to market risk arising from exchange rate movements between the dates foreign currencies are recorded and the dates they are settled nordson regularly uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce its risks related to most of these transactions these contracts primarily euro and yen usually have maturities of 90 days or less and generally require the company to exchange foreign currencies for us dollars at maturity at rates stated in the contracts gains and losses from changes in the market value of these contracts offset foreign exchange losses and gains respectively on the underlying transactions the balance of transactions denominated in foreign currencies are designated as hedges of the company’s net investments in foreign subsidiaries or are intercompany transactions of a longterm investment nature as a result of the company’s use of foreign exchange contracts on a routine basis to reduce the risks related to nearly all of the company’s transactions denominated in foreign currencies as of october 31 2006 the company did not have a material foreign currency risk related to its derivatives or other financial instruments note 11 to the financial statements contains additional information about the company’s foreign currency transactions and the methods and assumptions used by the company to record these transactions the company finances a portion of its operations with shortterm and longterm borrowings and is subject to market risk arising from changes in interest rates for its longterm debt 28 the tables that follow present principal repayments and related weightedaverage interest rates by expected maturity dates of fixedrate longterm debt 

at october 31 2006 

 at october 30 2005 

 the company also has variablerate notes payable the weighted average interest rate of this debt was 31 percent at the end of 2006 and 27 percent at the end of 2005 a 1 percent increase in interest rates would have resulted in additional interest expense of approximately 171 on the notes payable in fiscal 2006 

inflation 

inflation affects profit margins because the ability to pass cost increases on to customers is restricted by the need for competitive pricing although inflation has been modest in recent years and has had no material effect on the years covered by these financial statements nordson continues to seek ways to minimize the impact of inflation it does so through focused efforts to raise its productivity 

trends 

the fiveyear summary in item 6 documents nordson’s historical financial trends over this period the world’s economic conditions fluctuated significantly nordson’s solid performance is attributed to the company’s participation in diverse geographic and industrial markets and its longterm commitment to develop and provide quality products and worldwide service to meet customers’ changing needs

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend in this annual report all amounts related to us and foreign currency and to the number of shares of nordson corporation common shares except for per share earnings and dividend amounts are expressed in thousands 

critical accounting policies and estimates the company’s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires the company’s management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses on an ongoing basis the company evaluates the accounting policies and estimates it uses to prepare financial statements the company bases its estimates on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates used by management 

certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to the company’s results of operations or financial position are discussed below on a regular basis the company reviews critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors revenue recognition  — most of the company’s revenues are recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the sales price is fixed or determinable collectibility is reasonably assured and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer revenues from contracts with multiple element arrangements such as those including both installation and services are recognized as each element is earned based on objective evidence of the relative fair value of each element amounts received in excess of revenue recognized are included as deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheets revenues deferred in 2005 and 2004 were not material a limited number of the company’s large engineered systems sales contracts are accounted for using the percentageofcompletion method the amount of revenue recognized in any accounting period is based on the ratio of actual costs incurred through the end of the period to total estimated costs at completion cost estimates are updated on a quarterly basis during 2005 2004 and 2003 the company recognized approximately 5000 7000 and 5000 respectively of revenue under the percentageofcompletion method the remaining revenues are recognized upon delivery goodwill  — goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired at october 30 2005 and october 31 2004 goodwill represented 42 percent and 40 percent respectively of the company’s total assets the majority of the goodwill resulted from the acquisition of efd inc in fiscal 2001 in accordance with fasb statement no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level or more often if indications of impairment exist the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined by applying appropriate discount rates to estimated future cash flows and terminal value amounts for the reporting units the results of the company’s analyses indicated that no reduction of goodwill is required inventories  — inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market cost has been determined using the lastin firstout lifo method for 34 percent of the company’s consolidated inventories at october 30 2005 and 38 percent at october 31 2004 with the firstin firstout fifo method used for the remaining inventory on an ongoing basis the company tests its inventory for technical obsolescence as well as for future demand and changes in market conditions the company has historically maintained inventory reserves to reflect those conditions when the cost of inventory is not expected to be recovered the company also maintains inventory reserves for inventory used for demonstration purposes amounts charged to inventory reserves were 2905 4481 and 2670 in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the reserve balance was 7231 7294 and 7126 at the end of 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 12 pension plans and postretirement medical plan  — the measurement of liabilities related to the company’s pension plans and postretirement medical plan is based on management’s assumptions related to future factors including interest rates return on pension plan assets compensation increases mortality and turnover assumptions and health care cost trend rates the weightedaverage discount rate used to determine the present value of the company’s aggregate pension plan obligation was 54 percent at october 30 2005 compared to 58 percent at october 31 2004 the discount rate for the us plans which comprise 80 percent of the worldwide pension obligations was based on quality fixed income investments with a duration period approximately equal to the period over which pension obligations are expected to be settled the discount rates used for the various international plans were determined by using quality fixed income investments in determining the expected return on plan assets the company considers both historical performance and an estimate of future longterm rates of return on assets similar to those in the company’s plans the company consults with and considers the opinions of financial and other professionals in developing appropriate return assumptions the average expected rate of return longterm investment rate on pension assets decreased slightly from 82 percent in 2004 to 81 percent in 2005 the assumed rate of compensation increases was 33 percent in 2005 compared to 34 percent in 2004 annual expense amounts are determined based on the discount rate used at the end of the prior year differences between actual and assumed investment returns on pension plan assets result in actuarial gains or losses that are amortized into expense over a period of years with respect to the postretirement medical plan the discount rate used to value the benefit obligation decreased from 600 percent at october 31 2004 to 575 percent at october 30 2005 the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the health care trend rate is assumed to be 10 percent in 2006 decreasing gradually to 5 percent in 2011 the health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported for example a onepercentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects  employees hired after january 1 2002 are not eligible to participate in the postretirement medical plan the company expects that pension and postretirement expenses in fiscal 2006 will be approximately 3800 higher than fiscal 2005 primarily reflecting changes in actuarial assumptions financial instruments  — assets liabilities and commitments that are to be settled in cash and are denominated in foreign currencies are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates the company enters into foreign currency forward contracts which are derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of foreign currency exposures resulting from the collection of receivables payables and loans denominated in foreign currencies the maturities of these contracts are usually less than 90 days forward contracts are marked to market each accounting period and the resulting gains or losses are included in other income expense on the consolidated statement of income warranties  — the company provides customers with a product warranty that requires the company to repair or replace defective products within a specified period of time generally one year from the date of delivery or first use an accrual is recorded for expected warranty costs for products shipped through the end of each accounting period in determining the amount of the accrual the company relies primarily on historical warranty claims by product sold amounts charged to the warranty reserve were 4210 4165 and 2942 in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the reserve balance was 4405 4121 and 3030 at the end of 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 13 longterm incentive compensation plan ltip  — under this plan officers are awarded a cash payment if predetermined performance measures are met over a threeyear period the value of this payment is based upon the share price of the company’s common shares at a predetermined date subsequent to the end of each threeyear performance period over each threeyear performance period costs are accrued based on progress against performance measures along with changes in value of the company’s common shares at october 30 2005 the accrued liability for the 2003 2004 and 2005 ltip performance periods was 9836 the portion of these costs recognized in the income statement was 4237 in 2005 7004 for 2004 and 2653 for 2003 fiscal years 2005 and 2004 sales  — worldwide sales for 2005 were 839162 an increase of 57 percent from 2004 sales of 793544 sales volume increased 36 percent with favorable currency effects contributing an additional 21 percent to the overall sales gain

501665 in 2005 an increase of 3966 or 1 percent from 2004 currency effects added 3 percent to reported sales which was offset by a sales volume decrease of 2 percent within this segment lower nonwoven fiber system sales were partially offset by increases in the core packaging and product assembly businesses sales of the advanced technology segment were 197370 in 2005 an increase of 32469 or 20 percent from 2004 the increase was the result of 19 percent volume gains and 1 percent from the effects of currency within this segment the asymtek and march plasma businesses were especially strong with volume up over 33 percent in the aggregate from 2004 efd sales volume also increased finishing segment sales in 2005 were 140127 compared with 130944 in the prior year the 7 percent increase can be traced to a volume increase of 5 percent combined with currency effects of 2 percent the volume increase was due to strong container system sales across all geographic regions partially offset by a decrease in liquid system sales it is estimated that the effect of pricing on total revenue was neutral relative to the prior year nordson’s sales outside the united states accounted for 67 percent of total 2005 sales up slightly from 66 percent in 2004 sales volume was up 5 percent in the united states 17 percent in asia pacific 12 percent in the americas and 1 percent in japan these increases can be traced largely to the advanced technology segment offsetting these increases was a sales volume decrease of 3 percent in europe related to a large fiber system sale in the prior year operating profit  — cost of sales in 2005 was 371298 up 5 percent from 2004 due primarily to volume increases and currency effects gross margins expressed as a percent of sales increased to 558 percent in 2005 from 554 percent in 2004 the increase in the rate is attributable to product mix and currency effects selling and administrative expenses were 345322 in 2005 an increase of 16561 or 50 percent from 2004 the increase is due to currency translation effects of 19 percent and to compensation increases and higher employee benefit costs as a percent of sales these costs decreased to 412 percent in 2005 from 414 percent last year operating profit margins expressed as a percentage of sales were 145 percent in 2005 compared to 139 percent in 2004 segment operating profit margins in 2005 and 2004 were as follows  the improvement in profit margins in the advanced technology segment is traced primarily to better absorption of fixed operating expenses 14 operating profit of the finishing and coating segment includes 875 of severance and restructuring costs during the fourth quarter of 2005 the company announced a number of restructuring actions to improve performance and reduce costs in its finishing and coating segment these actions which include operational consolidations and approximately 60 personnel reductions will be substantially completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2006 as a result of these actions resources will be more effectively aligned with shifting patterns of global demands enabling the segment to operate both with lower costs and better capability to serve customers in the faster growing emerging markets the company expects that total restructuring costs will be approximately 3100 interest and other  — interest expense in 2005 was 13825 a decrease of 10 percent from 2004 due to lower borrowing levels interest and investment income in 2005 was 1864 up from 1350 in the prior year due to higher levels of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities other income was 1570 in 2005 compared to other expense of 2560 in 2004 included in these amounts were currency losses of 721 in 2005 and 201 in 2004 in 2004 other expenses included a loss of 3288 on the disposition of a minority equity investment net income — the company’s effective income tax rate was 296 percent in 2005 down from 325 percent in 2004 the decrease was primarily due to the reversal of a valuation allowance on foreign tax credits of 7367 offset somewhat by a lower extraterritorial income exclusion and a higher state income tax provision net income was 78338 or 214 per diluted share in 2005 this compares to net income of 63334 or 173 per diluted share in 2004 this represents a 24 percent increase in both net income and earnings per share

currency effects contributing an additional 56 percent to the overall sales gain sales of the adhesive segment were 497699 in 2004 an increase of 71495 from 2003 of the total 17 percent increase 10 percent was due to volume increases and 7 percent was due to currency effects all five businesses in the adhesive segment showed increased volume with more than half of the increase coming from higher product assembly and fiber system sales sales of the advanced technology segment were 164901 in 2004 an increase of 36480 from 2003 the increase was the result of 26 percent volume gains and 2 percent from the effects of currency within this segment the asymtek business which sells to customers in the semiconductor printed circuit board and electronic assembly industries was especially strong with volume up 50 percent from 2003 the other businesses in this segment all showed sales volume growth of at least 10 percent finishing segment sales in 2004 were 130944 compared with 112722 in the prior year the 16 percent increase can be traced to a volume increase of 11 percent and currency effects of 5 percent the volume increase was primarily due to a strong recovery in powder system sales across all geographic regions with the biggest growth seen in the united states and japan it is estimated that the effect of pricing on total revenue was neutral relative to the prior year 

nordson’s sales outside the united states accounted for 66 percent of total 2004 sales compared with 63 percent for 2003 sales volume in all five geographic regions increased in 2004 compared to 2003 sales volume was up 8 percent in the united states 19 percent in the americas 10 percent in europe 11 percent in japan and 48 percent in asia pacific the increase in asia pacific can be traced largely to the advanced technology segment and to higher fiber system sales 16 operating profit  — gross margins expressed as a percent of sales increased to 554 percent in 2004 from 548 percent in 2003 currency changes had a 9 percent favorable effect with the effect of mix and absorption offsetting this gain selling and administrative expenses were 328761 in 2004 an increase of 33229 or 112 percent from 2003 the increase is due to currency translation effects of 43 percent and to compensation increases and higher employee benefit costs as a percent of sales these costs decreased to 414 percent in 2004 from 442 percent last year operating profit margins expressed as a percentage of sales were 139 percent in 2004 compared to 102 percent in 2003 segment operating profit margins in 2004 and 2003 were as follows  the improvement in profit margins across all three segments can be traced to absorption of fixed operating expenses and to the effects of continuing cost controls related to lean initiatives in light of the difficult economic environment from 2000 to 2003 the company embarked on a number of cost reduction initiatives consistent with these initiatives the company recognized 2028 1359 on an aftertax basis or 04 per share of severance and restructuring costs in 2003 interest and other  — interest expense in 2004 was 15432 a decrease of 15 percent from 2003 the decrease was due to lower borrowing levels other expense was 2560 in 2004 compared to other income of 1430 last year the change was primarily due to a loss of 3288 on the disposition of a minority equity investment in addition currency losses of 201 were incurred in 2004 compared to gains of 558 in 2003 net income  — the company’s effective income tax rate was 325 percent in 2004 down from 330 percent in 2003 the decrease was due to a refund related to a prior tax year net income was 63334 or 173 per diluted share in 2004 this compares to net income of 35160 or 104 per diluted share in 2003 this represents an 80 percent increase in net income and 66 percent increase in earnings per share liquidity capital expenditures and sources of capital cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2005 were 11269 approximately equal to 2004 cash generated by operations in 2005 was 118831 up from 112923 last year the increase was due to higher net income offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities the increase in receivables is traced to higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to 2004 in 2005 a further improvement was achieved in days’ sales in accounts receivable a shipment of a large engineered system out of beginning backlog along with improved inventory turnover were the primary factors driving the decreases in inventories and accounts payable in 2005 an increase in accrued liabilities accounted for 6076 of cash provided by operations the increase was largely due to higher incentive compensation and pension accruals the reduction in deferred taxes in 2005 related primarily to the amortization of goodwill and to accruals not currently deductible income taxes payable increased largely due to higher pretax income other noncurrent assets increased due to the funding of a deferred compensation obligation increases in deferred compensation and pension accruals caused the increase in other noncurrent liabilities 

cash provided by investing activities was 33565 in 2005 compared to cash used by investing activities of 64403 in 2004 the change was due to the purchase of auction rate and variable rate demand obligation securities in 2004 that were sold in 2005 for the stock repurchase described below capital expenditures which were concentrated on information systems production equipment and previously leased buildings were 15389 cash of 557 was used for the acquisition of hp solutions inc dba hf johnson manufacturing a california machining company 17 cash used for financing activities in 2005 was 152040 cash of 132159 was used for the repurchase of the company’s common shares including the repurchase of approximately 10 percent of the company’s outstanding shares from the trustee of numerous trusts established by evan w nord funds for the repurchase came from cash marketable securities and borrowing under existing bank credit facilities dividend payments to shareholders totaled 23378 in 2005 increasing 3 percent on a pershare basis from 2004 issuance of common shares related to the exercise of stock options generated 9575 of cash the following table summarizes the company’s obligations as of october 30 2005  pension and postretirement plan funding amounts after 2006 will be determined based on the future funded status of the plans and therefore cannot be estimated at this time nordson has various lines of credit with both domestic and foreign banks at october 30 2005 these lines totaled 265425 of which 247032 was unused included in the total amount of 265425 is a 200000 facility with a group of banks that expires in 2009 this facility was entered into in october 2004 and replaced an existing facility that was scheduled to expire in 2006 the new facility may be increased from 200000 to 400000 under certain conditions at the end of 2005 4800 was outstanding under this line of credit there are two covenants that the company must meet under this facility the first covenant limits the amount of additional debt the company can incur at the end of 2005 this covenant would not have limited the amount the company could borrow under this facility the other covenant requires ebit as defined in the credit agreement to be at least three times interest expense the actual interest coverage was 96 for 2005 the company was in compliance with all debt covenants at october 30 2005 the company believes that the combination of present capital resources internally generated funds and unused financing sources are more than adequate to meet cash requirements for 2006 there are no significant restrictions limiting the transfer of funds from international subsidiaries to the parent company in october 2003 the board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to 2000 of the company’s common shares on the open market expected uses for repurchased shares include the funding of benefit programs including stock options restricted stock and 401k matching shares purchased will be treated as treasury shares until used for such purposes the repurchase program is funded using the company’s working capital during 2005 the company repurchased 203 of the shares authorized to be repurchased under this program as of october 30 2005 1722 shares may still be purchased under this program 18 outlook the company ended 2005 with a backlog of 77878 million up from 77573 at the beginning of the year during a teleconference with security analysts held on december 14 2005 management stated that it expected 2006 first quarter revenue to grow about 1 percent to 2 percent from 2005 with revenue for the quarter negatively effected by a stronger us dollar looking over the remaining course of the year with a low debt level and expectations of good cash flow the company will have the capability to respond to investment opportunities as they develop 

effects of foreign currency the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on sales and operating results cannot be precisely measured because of fluctuating selling prices sales volume product mix and cost structures in each country where nordson operates as a rule a weakening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies has a favorable effect on sales and net income while a strengthening of the us dollar has a detrimental effect 

in 2005 compared with 2004 the us dollar was generally weaker against foreign currencies if 2004 exchange rates had been in effect during 2005 sales would have been approximately 16510 lower and thirdparty costs would have been approximately 10618 lower in 2004 compared with 2003 the us dollar was also generally weaker against foreign currencies if 2003 exchange rates had been in effect during 2004 sales would have been approximately 37146 lower and thirdparty costs would have been approximately 22471 lower these effects on reported sales do not include the impact of local price adjustments made in response to changes in currency exchange rates 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company operates internationally and enters into transactions denominated in foreign currencies consequently the company is subject to market risk arising from exchange rate movements between the dates foreign currencies are recorded and the dates they are settled nordson regularly uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce its risks related to most of these transactions these contracts primarily euro and yen usually have maturities of 90 days or less and generally require the company to exchange foreign currencies for us dollars at maturity at rates stated in the contracts gains and losses from changes in the market value of these contracts offset foreign exchange losses and gains respectively on the underlying transactions the balance of transactions denominated in foreign currencies are designated as hedges of the company’s net investments in foreign subsidiaries or are intercompany transactions of a longterm investment nature as a result of the company’s use of foreign exchange contracts on a routine basis to reduce the risks related to nearly all of the company’s transactions denominated in foreign currencies as of october 30 2005 the company did not have a material foreign currency risk related to its derivatives or other financial instruments note 10 to the financial statements contains additional information about the company’s foreign currency transactions and the methods and assumptions used by the company to record these transactions the company finances a portion of its operations with shortterm and longterm borrowings and is subject to market risk arising from changes in interest rates for most of its longterm debt 19 the tables that follow present principal repayments and related weightedaverage interest rates by expected maturity dates of fixedrate longterm debt at october 30 2005  at october 31 2004  the tables that follow present principal repayments by expected maturity dates of variablerate longterm debt at october 30 2005  at october 31 2004  included in the variablerate tables above is longterm debt in the amount of japanese yen 200000 this debt was converted from fixed rate to variable rate through an interest rate swap agreement also included in the tables above is longterm debt in the amount of 40000 this debt was converted from fixed rate to variable rate through an interest rate swap agreement these swaps are discussed in notes 9 and 10 to the company’s financial statements the weightedaverage interest rate of the company’s variablerate debt was 694 percent at the end of fiscal 2005 compared to 508 percent at the end of 2004 a 1 percent increase in interest rates would have resulted in approximately 419 of additional interest expense in fiscal 2005 the company also has variablerate notes payable the weighted average interest rate of this debt was 27 percent at the end of 2005 and 2004 a 1 percent increase in interest rates would have resulted in additional interest expense of approximately 186 on the notes payable in fiscal 2005 20 inflation inflation affects profit margins because the ability to pass cost increases on to customers is restricted by the need for competitive pricing although inflation has been modest in recent years and has had no material effect on the years covered by these financial statements nordson continues to seek ways to minimize the impact of inflation it does so through focused efforts to raise its productivity 

trends the fiveyear summary in item 6 documents nordson’s historical financial trends over this period the world’s economic conditions fluctuated significantly nordson’s solid performance is attributed to the company’s participation in diverse geographic and industrial markets and its longterm commitment to develop and provide quality products and worldwide service to meet customers’ changing needs

certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to the company’s results of operations or financial position are discussed below on a regular basis the company reviews critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors revenue recognition  — most of the company’s revenues are recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the sales price is fixed or determinable collectibility is reasonably assured and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer revenues from contracts with multiple element arrangements such as those including both installation and services are recognized as each element is earned based on objective evidence of the relative fair value of each element amounts received in excess of revenue recognized are included as deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheets revenues deferred in 2004 were not material a limited number of the company’s large engineered systems sales contracts are accounted for using the percentageofcompletion method the amount of revenue recognized in any accounting period is based on the ratio of actual costs incurred through the end of the period to total estimated costs at completion cost estimates are updated on a quarterly basis during 2004 2003 and 2002 the company recognized approximately 7000 5000 and 20000 respectively of revenue under the percentageofcompletion method the remaining revenues are recognized upon delivery goodwill  — goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired at october 31 2004 goodwill represented approximately 40 percent of the company’s total assets the majority of the goodwill resulted from the acquisition of efd inc in fiscal 2001 in 2002 the company adopted fasb statement no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” which provides that goodwill should not be amortized but instead be tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level in accordance with no 142 the company completed a transitional goodwill impairment test that resulted in no impairment loss being recognized goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and more often if indications of impairment exist the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined by applying appropriate discount rates to estimated future cash flows and terminal value amounts for the reporting units the results of the company’s analyses indicated that no reduction of goodwill is required 11 inventories  — inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market cost has been determined using the lastin firstout method for 38 percent of the company’s consolidated inventories at october 31 2004 with the firstin firstout method used for the remaining inventory on an ongoing basis the company tests its inventory for technical obsolescence as well as for future demand and changes in market conditions the company has historically maintained inventory reserves to reflect those conditions when the cost of inventory is not expected to be recovered in the face of difficult economic conditions that accelerated the technical obsolescence of certain inventory and impacted the demand outlook for other inventory the company recognized an inventory writedown of 11388 in the fourth quarter of 2002 7630 on an aftertax basis or 23 per share the addition of 11388 to the inventory obsolescence reserve brought the reserve balance to 23149 during 2003 21281 of inventory was disposed of and charged against the reserve and 2243 was added to the reserve after a currency effect of 444 the balance in the inventory obsolescence reserve was 4555 at november 2 2003 during 2004 3066 of inventory was disposed of and charged against the reserve and 2782 was added to the reserve after a currency effect of 130 the balance in the inventory obsolescence reserve was 4401 at october 31 2004

future factors including interest rates return on pension plan assets compensation increases and health care cost trend rates the weightedaverage discount rate based on aa quality fixed income investments used to determine the present value of the company’s aggregate pension plan obligation was 58 percent at october 31 2004 compared to 59 percent at november 2 2003 the average expected rate of return longterm investment rate on pension assets increased slightly from 81 percent in 2003 to 82 percent in 2004 the assumed rate of compensation increases was 34 percent in 2004 compared to 33 percent in 2003 annual expense amounts are determined based on the discount rate used at the end of the prior year differences between actual and assumed investment returns on pension plan assets result in actuarial gains or losses that are amortized into expense over a period of years with respect to the postretirement medical plan the discount rate used to value the benefit obligation decreased from 625 percent at november 2 2003 to 60 percent at october 31 2004 the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the health care trend rate is assumed to be 80 percent in 2005 decreasing gradually to 50 percent in 2009 the health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported for example a onepercentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects  employees hired after january 1 2002 are not eligible to participate in the postretirement medical plan the company expects that pension and postretirement expenses in fiscal 2005 will be approximately 1400 higher than fiscal 2004 reflecting among other things changes in actuarial assumptions and plan design changes financial instruments  — assets liabilities and commitments that are to be settled in cash and are denominated in foreign currencies are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates the company enters into foreign currency forward contracts which are derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of foreign currency exposures resulting from the collection of receivables payables and loans

warranty costs for 2004 were 4165 longterm incentive compensation plan ltip  — under this plan officers are awarded a cash payment if predetermined performance measures are met over a threeyear period

with more than half of the increase coming from higher product assembly and fiber system sales finishing segment sales in 2004 were 130944 compared with 112722 in the prior year the 16 percent increase can be traced to a volume increase of 11 percent and currency effects of 5 percent the volume increase was primarily due to a strong recovery in powder system sales across all geographic regions with the biggest growth seen in the united states and japan sales of the advanced technology segment were 164901 in 2004 an increase of 36480 from 2003 the increase was the result of 26 percent volume gains and 2 percent from the effects of currency within this segment the asymtek business which sells to customers in the semiconductor printed circuit board and electronic assembly industries was especially strong with volume up 50 percent from 2003 the other businesses in this segment all showed sales volume growth of at least 10 percent it is estimated that the effect of pricing on total revenue was neutral relative to the prior year 

nordson’s sales outside the united states accounted for 66 percent of total 2004 sales compared with 63 percent for 2003 during 2004 the company realigned its geographic reporting previously sales

percent in the americas 10 percent in europe 11 percent in japan and 48 percent in asia pacific the increase in asia pacific can be traced largely to the advanced technology segment and to higher fiber system sales operating profit  — gross margins expressed as a percent of sales increased to 554 percent in 2004 from 548 percent in 2003 currency changes had a 9 percent favorable effect with the effect of mix and absorption offsetting this gain selling and administrative expenses were 328633 in 2004 an increase of 33476 or 113 percent from 2003 the increase is due to currency translation

these initiatives the company recognized 2028 1359 on an aftertax basis or 04 per share of severance and restructuring costs in 2003 interest and other  — interest expense in 2004 was 15432 a decrease of 15 percent from 2003 the decrease was due to lower borrowing levels other expense was 2688 in 2004 compared to other income of 1055 last year the change was primarily due to a loss of 3288 on the

provides prescription drug benefits under medicare “medicare part d” as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d currently statement of financial accounting standard no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” “no 106” requires that changes in relevant law be considered in current measurement of postretirement benefit costs the company’s measures of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and the net periodic postretirement benefit cost do not reflect the effects of the subsidy because benefits under the company’s plan are not actuarially equivalent to medicare part d the adoption of fsp no 1062 had no effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations in november 2004 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 151 “inventory costs” no 151 amends accounting research bulletin

the ability to account for sharebased compensation transactions using the intrinsic method currently used by the company no 123r requires such transactions be accounted for using a fairvaluebased method that would result in expense being recognized in the company’s financial statements the company will be required to adopt no 123r in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and has not yet determined the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial position or results of operations fiscal years 2003 and 2002 sales  — worldwide sales for 2003 were 667347 an increase of 3 percent from 2002 sales of 647756 a sales volume decline of 3 percent was more than offset by a 6 percent increase in revenue traced to favorable currency effects 

sales within the adhesive segment increased 3 percent with a 7 percent increase from currency effects offset by a 4 percent decline in volume a dropoff in shipments of large engineered systems used in the production of nonwoven fabrics and in the assembly of durable goods accounted for virtually the entire volume decline advanced technology segment sales increased 7 percent with volume up 4 percent and favorable currency effects contributing an additional 3 percent improved activity related to sales of plasma treatment systems and manual fluid dispensing systems to the electronics and medical industries as well as sales of uv curing systems to the graphic arts industry accounted for the higher volume within this segment finishing and coating segment revenue was down 1 percent in 2003 sales volume was down 6 percent offset by a 5 percent increase from favorable currency effects the volume decline was influenced by lower engineered system sales in north america it is estimated that the effect of pricing on total revenue was neutral relative to the prior year 16 nordson’s sales outside the united states accounted for 63 percent of total 2003 sales compared with 57 percent for 2002 sales volume decreased 12 percent in the united states 4 percent in europe and 1 percent in the americas offsetting these decreases were increases of 17 percent in japan and 28 percent in the asia pacific regions volume was up in all segments in japan while advanced technology was primarily responsible for the increase in the asia pacific region operating profit  — gross margins expressed as a percentage of sales were 548 percent in 2003 compared to 521 percent in 2002 in 2002 the company recognized a pretax inventory writedown of 11388 excluding the effect of this writedown the 2003 gross margin rate improved by 10 percent over 2002 favorable currency effects accounted for approximately a 11 percent increase in the gross margin rate with the effect of product mix offsetting a portion of this improvement selling and administrative expenses increased by 48 percent over 2002 currency translation effects accounted for a 44 percent increase with the balance of the increase traced to compensation adjustments and higher employee benefit costs selling and administrative expenses excluding severance and restructuring costs amounted to 442 percent of sales in 2003 compared to 435 percent of sales in 2002 in light of the difficult economic environment over the last three years the company embarked on a number of cost reduction initiatives consistent with these initiatives the company recognized 2028 1359 on an aftertax basis or 04 per share of severance and restructuring costs in 2003 in 2002 the company recognized 2690 1802 million on an aftertax basis or 05 per share of restructuring charges consisting of severance and other costs associated with the combination of certain businesses of the total amount 191 was included in cost of sales operating profit margins expressed as a percentage of sales were 103 percent in 2003 compared to 82 percent in 2002 segment operating profit margins in 2003 and 2002 after restatement for the allocation of a larger portion of corporate expenses were as follows  the lower adhesive segment operating margin in 2003 compared to 2002 is traced primarily to absorption of fixed operating expenses related to a direct distribution organization in an environment where sales volume declined in addition higher initial manufacturing costs were incurred associated with the introduction of a new family of products operating margin increases in both the finishing and coating and the advanced technology segments are due to improved manufacturing cost absorption the restructuring initiatives conducted over the last three years impacted all segments favorably interest and other  — interest expense of 18063 decreased 3650 from 2002 due to lower borrowing levels and lower interest rates other income increased from 714 in 2002 to 1055 in 2003 mainly due to currency gains of 558 in 2003 in 2003 the company recorded a charge of 375 in other expense related to the wisconsin municipal landfill described above through the end of fiscal 2003 the company had committed 700 towards completing the fsri phase of the project and providing clean drinking water this amount was recorded in the company’s financial statements against this commitment the company had made payments of 325 through the end of fiscal 2003 the remaining amount of 375 was recorded in accrued liabilities in the november 2 2003 consolidated balance sheet net income  — the company’s effective tax rate was 330 percent for both 2003 and 2002 net income in 2003 was 35160 or 104 per share on a diluted basis compared with 22072 or 66 per share on a diluted basis in 2002 as noted above 2002 included a pretax inventory writedown of 11388 or 23 per share 17 liquidity capital expenditures and sources of capital cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2004 were 60251 an increase of 53306 from 2003 cash generated by operations in 2004 was 109318 up from 87547 last year the increase was primarily due to higher net income changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a use of 563 of cash increases in accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable resulted in a use of 11535 of cash the increases were entirely due to increased business activity in 2004 compared to 2003 further improvements were achieved in inventory turnover and days sales in accounts receivable in the current year an increase in accrued liabilities accounted for 5643 of the increase in cash this increase was largely due to higher incentive compensation accruals a reduction in deferred taxes in 2004 related primarily to pension payments and the amortization of goodwill 

cash used by investing activities was 15328 in 2004 capital expenditures which were concentrated on information systems and production equipment were 11437 cash of 4013 was used for the acquisition of w puffe technologie a german manufacturer of hot melt adhesive dispensing systems for the textile aerospace life science automotive construction and baby diaper industries cash used in financing activities in 2004 was 41602 the company repaid 72024 of notes payable and longterm debt in 2004 bringing the debt to equity ratio down from 80 at november 2 2003 to 44 at october 31 2004 dividend payments to shareholders totaled 22128 in 2004 increasing 3 percent on a pershare basis from 2003 issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options generated 56758 of cash on may 18 2004 the company entered into an interest rate swap to convert 40000 of 679 percent fixed rate debt due in may 2006 to variable rate debt the variable rate is reset semiannually and at october 31 2004 the rate was 534 percent the following table summarizes the company’s obligations as of october 31 2004  nordson has various lines of credit with both domestic and foreign banks at october 31 2004 these lines totaled 277958 of which 262657 was unused included in the total amount of 277958 is a 200000 facility with a group of banks that expires in 2009 this facility was entered into on october 19 2004 and replaced an existing facility that was scheduled to expire in 2006 the new facility may be increased from 200000 to 400000 under certain conditions it was unused at the end of 2004 there are two covenants that the company must meet under this facility the first covenant limits the amount of additional debt the company can incur at the end of 2004 this covenant would not have limited the amount the company could borrow under this facility the other covenant requires ebit as defined in the credit agreement to be at least three times interest expense the actual interest coverage was 787 for 2004 the company was in compliance with all debt covenants at october 31 2004 the company believes that the combination of present capital resources internally generated funds and unused financing sources are more than adequate to meet cash requirements for 2005 there are no significant restrictions limiting the transfer of funds from international subsidiaries to the parent company 18 in october 2003 the board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to 2000 shares of the company’s common stock on the open market expected uses for repurchased shares include the funding of benefit programs including stock options restricted stock and 401k matching shares purchased will be treated as treasury shares until used for such purposes the repurchase program will be funded using the company’s working capital during october 2004 the company repurchased approximately 1 percent of the shares authorized to be repurchased under this program outlook the company ended 2004 with a backlog of 78 million up 11 million from the beginning of the year and is poised for a strong start to 2005 looking over the course of the year we will continue to focus on identifying new market opportunities with a low debt level and expectations of good cash flow the company will have the capability to respond to opportunities as they develop 

effects of foreign currency the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on sales and operating results cannot be precisely measured because of fluctuating selling prices sales volume product mix and cost structures in each country where nordson operates as a rule a weakening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies has a favorable effect on sales and net income while a strengthening of the us dollar has a detrimental effect 

in 2004 compared with 2003 the us dollar was generally weaker against foreign currencies if 2003 exchange rates had been in effect during 2004 sales would have been approximately 37146 lower and thirdparty costs would have been approximately 22471 lower in 2003 compared with 2002 the us dollar was also generally weaker against foreign currencies if 2002 exchange rates had been in effect during 2003 sales would have been approximately 37685 lower and thirdparty costs would have been approximately 22408 lower these effects on reported sales do not include the impact of local price adjustments made in response to changes in currency exchange rates 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company operates internationally and enters into transactions denominated in foreign currencies consequently the company is subject to market risk arising from exchange rate movements between the dates foreign currencies are recorded and the dates they are settled nordson regularly uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce its risks related to most of these transactions these contracts primarily euro and yen usually have maturities of 90 days or less and generally require the company to exchange foreign currencies for us dollars at maturity at rates stated in the contracts gains and losses from changes in the market value of these contracts offset foreign exchange losses and gains respectively on the underlying transactions the balance of transactions denominated in foreign currencies are designated as hedges of the company’s net investments in foreign subsidiaries or are intercompany transactions of a longterm investment nature as a result of the company’s use of foreign exchange contracts on a routine basis to reduce the risks related to nearly all of the company’s transactions denominated in foreign currencies as of october 31 2004 the company did not have a material foreign currency risk related to its derivatives or other financial instruments note 10 to the financial statements contains additional information about the company’s foreign currency transactions and the methods and assumptions used by the company to record these transactions the company finances a portion of its operations with shortterm and longterm borrowings and is subject to market risk arising from changes in interest rates for most of its longterm debt 19 the tables that follow present principal cash flows and related weightedaverage interest rates by expected maturity dates of fixedrate longterm debt expected maturity date october 31 2004  expected maturity date november 2 2003  the tables that follow present principal cash flows and related weightedaverage interest rates by expected maturity dates of variablerate longterm debt expected maturity date october 31 2004  expected maturity date november 2 2003  included in the variablerate tables above is longterm debt in the amount of japanese yen 200000 this debt was converted from fixed rate to variable rate through an interest rate swap agreement included in the october 31 2004 table above is longterm debt in the amount of 40000 this debt was converted from fixed rate to variable rate through an interest rate swap agreement these swaps are discussed in notes 9 and 10 to the company’s financial statements the weightedaverage interest rate of the company’s variablerate debt was 508 percent at the end of fiscal 2004 compared to 97 percent at the end of 2003 a 1 percent increase in interest rates would have resulted in approximately 312 of additional interest expense in fiscal 2004 the company also has variablerate notes payable the weighted average interest rate of this debt was 27 percent at the end of 2004 compared to 25 percent at the end of 2003 a 1 percent increase in interest rates would have resulted in additional interest expense of approximately 228 on the notes payable in fiscal 2004 inflation inflation affects profit margins because the ability to pass cost increases on to customers is restricted by the need for competitive pricing although inflation has been modest in recent years and has had no material effect on the years covered by these financial statements nordson continues to seek ways to minimize the impact of inflation it does so through focused efforts to raise its productivity 

20 trends the fiveyear summary in item 6 documents nordson’s historical financial trends over this period the world’s economic conditions fluctuated significantly nordson’s solid performance is attributed to the company’s participation in diverse geographic and industrial markets and its longterm commitment to develop and provide quality products and worldwide service to meet customers’ changing needs

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend critical accounting policies and estimates the company’s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires the company’s management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses on an ongoing basis the company evaluates the accounting policies and estimates it uses to prepare financial statements the company bases its estimates on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates used by management 

certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to the company’s results of operations or financial position are discussed below on a regular basis the company reviews critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors revenue recognition  — most of the company’s revenues are recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the sales price is fixed or determinable collectibility is reasonably assured and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer revenues from contracts with multiple element arrangements such as those including both installation and services are recognized as each element is earned based on objective evidence of the relative fair value of each element amounts received in excess of revenue recognized are included as deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheets revenues deferred in 2003 were not material a limited number of the company’s large engineered systems sales contracts are accounted for using the percentageofcompletion method the amount of revenue recognized in any accounting period is based on the ratio of actual costs incurred through the end of the period to total estimated costs at completion cost estimates are updated on a quarterly basis during 2003 and 2002 the company recognized approximately 5 million and 20 million respectively of revenue under the percentageofcompletion method the remaining revenues are recognized upon delivery goodwill  — goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired at november 2 2003 goodwill represented approximately 43 percent of the company’s total assets the majority of the goodwill resulted from the acquisition of efd inc in 2001 in 2002 the company adopted fasb statement no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” which provides that goodwill should not be amortized but instead be tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level in accordance with no 142 the company completed a transitional goodwill impairment test that resulted in no impairment loss being recognized goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and more often if indications of impairment exist the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined by applying appropriate discount rates to estimated future cash flows and terminal value amounts for the reporting units the results of the company’s analyses indicated that no reduction of goodwill is required in 2001 goodwill amortization was 15446000 11243000 on an aftertax basis or 34 per share inventories  — inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market cost has been determined using the lastin firstout method for 39 percent of the company’s consolidated inventories at november 2 2003 with the firstin firstout method used for the remaining inventory on an ongoing basis the company tests its inventory for technical obsolescence as well as for future demand and changes in market conditions the company has historically maintained inventory reserves to reflect those conditions when the cost of inventory is not expected to be recovered in the face of difficult economic conditions that accelerated the technical obsolescence of certain inventory and impacted the demand outlook for other inventory the company recognized an inventory writedown of 114 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 76 million on an aftertax basis or 23 per share the addition of 114 million to the inventory obsolescence reserve brought the reserve balance to 231 million during 2003 approximately 213 million of inventory was disposed of and charged against the reserve and 22 million was added to the reserve after a currency effect of 5 million the balance in the inventory obsolescence reserve was 45 million at november 2 2003 10 pension plans and other postretirement medical plan  — the measurement of liabilities related to the company’s pension plans and postretirement medical plan is based on management’s assumptions related to future factors including interest rates return on pension plan assets compensation increases and health care cost trend rates the weightedaverage discount rate based on aa quality fixed income investments used to determine the present value of the company’s aggregate pension plan obligation was 59 percent at november 2 2003 compared to 65 percent at november 3 2002 the average expected rate of return longterm investment rate on pension assets was decreased to 81 percent in 2003 from 86 percent in 2002 the assumed rate of compensation increases was reduced from 37 percent in 2002 to 33 percent in 2003 to reflect an inflationary outlook consistent with the discount and longterm investment yield assumptions annual expense amounts are determined based on the discount rate used at the end of the prior year differences between actual and assumed investment returns on pension plan assets result in actuarial gains or losses which are amortized into expense over a period of years with respect to the postretirement medical plan the discount rate used to value the benefit obligation was 625 percent at november 2 2003 a decrease from 675 at november 3 2002 the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the health care trend rate is assumed to be 78 percent in 2004 decreasing gradually to 50 percent in 2008 the health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported for example a onepercentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects  employees hired after january 1 2002 are not eligible to participate in the postretirement medical plan the overall effect of the assumption changes above will be to increase pension and postretirement expenses in fiscal 2004 by approximately 2 million financial instruments  — assets liabilities and commitments that are to be settled in cash and are denominated in foreign currencies are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates the company enters into foreign currency forward contracts which are derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of foreign currency exposures resulting from the collection of receivables payables and loans denominated in foreign currencies the maturities of these contracts are usually less than 90 days forward contracts are marked to market each accounting period and the resulting gains or losses are included in other income expense on the consolidated statement of income warranties  — the company provides customers with a product warranty that requires the company to repair or replace defective products within a specified period of time generally one year for the date of sale an accrual is recorded for expected warranty costs for products shipped through the end of each accounting period in determining the amount of the accrual the company relies primarily on historical warranty claims by product sold at november 2 2003 the warranty accrual was 30 million while warranty costs for 2003 were 29 million longterm incentive compensation plans ltip  — under these plans officers are awarded ltip units if predetermined performance targets are met over a threeyear period the value of these units is based upon the share price of the company’s stock at the end of the third year of each plan over the period of each plan costs are accrued based on progress against performance targets along with changes in value of the company’s stock at november 2 2003 the accrued liability for the 2002 and 2003 plans amounted to 41 million the portion of these costs recognized in the income statement was 27 million for 2003 and 14 million for 2002 at this time it is estimated that costs to be recognized in the 2004 income statement for the 2002 and 2003 plans as well as the plan commencing in 2004 will be 61 million 11 fiscal years 2003 and 2002 worldwide sales for 2003 were 6673 million an increase of 3 percent from 2002 sales of 6478 million a sales volume decline of 3 percent was more than offset by a 6 percent increase in revenue traced to favorable currency effects 

sales within the adhesive segment increased 3 percent with a 7 percent increase from currency effects offset by a 4 percent decline in volume a dropoff in shipments of large engineered systems used in the production of nonwoven fabrics and in the assembly of durable goods accounted for virtually the entire volume decline advanced technology segment sales increased 7 percent with volume up 4 percent and favorable currency effects contributing an additional 3 percent improved activity related to sales of plasma treatment systems and manual fluid dispensing systems to the electronics and medical industries as well as sales of uv curing systems to the graphic arts industry accounted for the higher volume within this segment coating and finishing segment revenue was down 1 percent in 2003 sales volume was down 6 percent offset by a 5 percent increase from favorable currency effects the volume decline was influenced by lower engineered system sales in north america it is estimated that the effect of pricing on total revenue was neutral relative to the prior year nordson’s sales outside the united states accounted for 63 percent of total 2003 sales compared with 57 percent for 2002 sales volume decreased 11 percent in north america and 4 percent in europe offsetting these decreases were increases of 17 percent in both japan and the pacific south regions volume was up in all segments in japan while advanced technology was primarily responsible for the increase in the pacific south region gross margins expressed as a percentage of sales were 548 percent in 2003 compared to 521 percent in 2002 in 2002 the company recognized a pretax inventory writedown of 114 million excluding the effect of this writedown the 2003 gross margin rate improved by 10 percent over 2002 favorable currency effects accounted for approximately a 11 percent increase in the gross margin rate with the effect of product mix offsetting a portion of this improvement selling and administrative expenses increased by 48 percent over 2002 currency translation effects accounted for a 44 percent increase with the balance of the increase traced to compensation adjustments and higher employee benefit costs selling and administrative expenses excluding severance and restructuring costs amounted to 442 percent of sales in 2003 compared to 435 percent of sales in 2002 in light of the difficult economic environment over the last three years the company embarked on a number of cost reduction initiatives consistent with these initiatives the company recognized 20 million 14 million on an aftertax basis or 04 per share of severance and restructuring costs in 2003 no additional restructuring costs are expected in 2004 operating profit margins expressed as a percentage of sales were 103 percent in 2003 compared to 82 percent in 2002 segment operating profit margins in 2003 and 2002 excluding corporate costs not allocated to segments were as follows  the lower adhesive segment operating margin in 2003 compared to 2002 is traced primarily to absorption of fixed operating expenses related to a direct distribution organization in an environment where sales volume declined in addition higher initial manufacturing costs were incurred associated with the introduction of a new family of products operating margin increases in both the coating and finishing and the advanced technology segments are due to improved manufacturing cost absorption the restructuring initiatives conducted over the last three years impacted all segments favorably 12 in 2003 the company recorded a charge of 375000 in other expense we have been identified as a potentially responsible party prp at a wisconsin municipal landfill and has voluntarily agreed with other prp’s to share costs associated with 1 a feasibility study and remedial investigation “fsri” for the site and 2 providing clean drinking water to the affected residential properties through completion of the fsri phase of the project the fs ri is expected to be completed in 2005 the company is committing 700000 towards completing the fs ri phase of the project and providing clean drinking water this amount has been recorded in the company’s financial statements against this commitment the company has made payments of 325000 through the end of 2003 the remaining amount of 375000 is recorded in accrued liabilities in the november 2 2003 consolidated balance sheet interest expense of 181 million decreased 36 million from 2002 due to lower borrowing levels and lower interest rates other income increased 714000 in 2002 to 1055000 in 2003 mainly due to currency gains of 558000 in 2003 the company’s effective tax rate was 3300 percent for both 2003 and 2002 net income in 2003 was 352 million or 104 per share on a diluted basis

accounting standard board fasb statements no 141 “business combinations” and no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” no 141 requires that all business combinations be accounted for by the purchase method and that certain acquired intangible assets be recognized as assets apart from goodwill no 142 provides that goodwill should not be amortized but instead be tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level in accordance with no 142 the company completed a transitional goodwill impairment test that resulted in no impairment loss being recognized the annual impairment test completed in 2003 indicated that no writedown was required in 2001 goodwill amortization was 15446000 11243000 on an aftertax basis or 34 per share in 2002 the company adopted fasb statement of financial standards no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” no 143 requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred when a liability is initially recorded the entity capitalizes a cost by increasing the carrying value of the related longlived asset over time the liability is accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset upon settlement of the liability an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement there was no impact on the company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations as a result of the adoption of no 143 in 2002 the company adopted fasb statement of financial standards no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” no 144 which supersedes no 121 “accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and for longlived assets to be disposed of” provides a single accounting model for longlived assets to be disposed of although retaining many of the fundamental recognition and measurement provisions of no 121 this statement significantly changes the criteria that would have to be met to classify an asset as heldforsale this distinction is important because assets heldforsale are stated at the lower of their fair values or carrying amounts and depreciation is no longer recognized there was no impact on the company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations as a result of the adoption of no 144 in 2003 the company adopted fasb statement no 145 “rescission of statements no 4 44 and 64 amendment of fasb statement no 13 and technical corrections” this statement eliminates the

sales volume in the company’s adhesive dispensing systems segment decreased 4 percent increases in packaging sales volume were more than offset by lower sales of nonwoven systems in north america advanced technology segment volume was down 29 percent primarily due to the continuing global slowdown in the semiconductor and electronics industries coating and finishing systems segment sales volume was down 13 percent influenced significantly by lower engineered systems sales in north america it is estimated that the effect of pricing on total revenues was neutral relative to the prior year nordson’s sales outside the united states accounted for 57 percent of total 2002 sales compared with 54 percent for 2001 sales volume decreased in all four of nordson’s geographic regions volume decreased 17 percent in north america 3 percent in europe 15 percent in japan and 9 percent in the pacific south region the slowdown in advanced technology and capital goods sectors was felt across all of these regions gross margins before restructuring charges and inventory writedowns expressed as a percentage of sales were 538 percent in 2002 compared with 540 percent in 2001 a change in the mix of products sold pricing pressures and higher indirect costs caused the lower margins the company recognized a fourth quarter inventory writedown of 114 million 76 million on an aftertax basis or 23 per share gross margins including restructuring charges and inventory writedowns were 521 percent in 2002 down from 539 percent in 2001 selling and administrative expenses excluding goodwill amortization and severance and restructuring costs were 435 percent of sales in 2002 and 418 percent in 2001 spending for 2002 decreased 79 percent as a result of the company’s organizational restructuring and facility consolidations as a result of adopting fasb statement no 142 at the beginning of 2002 the company no longer amortizes goodwill goodwill amortization was 15446000 in 2001 as a result of the continuing economic slowdown during 2002 the company recognized 27 million 18 million on an aftertax basis or 05 per share of restructuring charges consisting of severance and other costs associated with the combination of certain businesses of the total amount 2 million is included in cost of sales 15 worldwide operating profits expressed as a percentage of sales before the effects of nonrecurring charges were 104 percent in 2002 compared with 101 percent for 2001 segment operating profit percentages in 2002 and 2001 excluding corporate expenses that are not allocated to segments were as follows  all segments were impacted by the global economic downturn interest expense of 217 million decreased 78 million from 2001 primarily due to lower borrowing levels other income decreased 55 million from 2001 which included a gain of 51 million on the sale of real estate nordson’s effective tax rate was 3300 percent in 2002 compared with a rate of 3475 percent in 2001 the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party prp at a wisconsin municipal landfill and has voluntarily agreed with other prp’s to share costs associated with a feasibility study and remedial investigation “fs ri” for the site with the company committing up to 325000 toward the fs ri this amount has been recorded in the company’s financial statements net income in 2002 was 221 million or 66 per share on a diluted basis compared with 246 million or 74 per share on a diluted basis in 2001 excluding goodwill amortization net income for 2001 was 359 million or 108 per share included in 2002 were inventory writedowns of 114 million or 23 per share liquidity capital expenditures and sources of capital cash generated by operations in 2003 was 875 million compared to 1304 million in 2002 the company generated 72 million of cash in 2003 through continued focus on management of operating working capital further improvements were achieved in inventory turnover and days sales outstanding in accounts receivable an increase in accounts receivable due to higher fourth quarter sales resulted in a use of cash of 69 million for the year compared to 2002 when receivables decreased by over 32 million inventory reductions generated over 125 million of cash in 2003 compared to 416 million in 2002 an increase in accrued liabilities generated 58 million of cash this increase was largely due to higher incentive compensation accruals a reduction in deferred taxes in 2003 related to the 2002 inventory writedown impacted cash from operating activities favorably by 76 million 

cash used by investing activities was 68 million in 2003 capital expenditures which were concentrated on information systems and production equipment were 76 million cash used in financing activities in 2003 was 806 million the company repaid 648 million of notes payable and longterm debt in 2003 bringing the debt to equity ratio down from 11 at november 3 2002 to 80 at november 2 2003 dividend payments to shareholders totaled 204 million in 2003 increasing 6 percent on a pershare basis from 2002 issuance of common stock primarily related to the exercise of stock options generated 89 million of cash in march 2003 the company acquired full ownership interest in land and a building owned by a partnership that leased office and manufacturing space to the company the real estate is located in duluth georgia and serves as the worldwide headquarters for the company’s adhesives businesses as a result the company assumed 107 million of debt owed by the partnership real estate with a net book value of 103 million cash and other current liabilities prior to march the company leased the property under an operating lease with a partnership in which the company was a partner 16 the following table summarizes the company’s obligations as of november 2 2003  nordson has various lines of credit with both domestic and foreign banks at november 2 2003 these lines totaled 317 million of which 258 million was unused included in the total amount of 317 million is a 250 million facility with a group of banks that expires in 2006 there are three covenants that the company must meet under this facility the first covenant limits the amount of additional debt the company can incur at the end of 2003 the company could have incurred approximately 95 million of debt under this covenant the second covenant requires ebit as defined in the credit agreement to be at least three times interest expense the actual interest coverage was 435 for 2003 the final covenant requires the company’s shareholders’ equity to be at least 237 million at the end of 2003 actual shareholders’ equity was 300 million the company was in compliance with all debt covenants at november 2 2003 the company has issued guarantees to two banks to support the shortterm borrowing facilities of an unconsolidated korean affiliate one guarantee is for korean won three billion approximately 2535000 secured by land and building and expires on july 31 2004 the other guarantee is for 2300000 and expires on october 31 2004 under these arrangements the company could be required to fulfill obligations of the affiliate if the affiliate does not make required payments no amount is recorded in the company’s financial statements related to these guarantees the company believes that the combination of present capital resources internally generated funds and unused financing sources are more than adequate to meet cash requirements for 2004 there are no significant restrictions limiting the transfer of funds from international subsidiaries to the parent company in october 2003 the board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to two million shares of the company’s common stock on the open market expected uses for repurchased shares include the funding of benefit programs including stock options restricted stock and 401k matching shares purchased will be treated as treasury shares until used for such purposes the repurchase program will be funded using the company’s working capital no shares were purchased under this program in 2003 outlook sales volume for the fourth quarter of 2003 increased one percent from 2002 compared to decreases for the first three quarters in addition backlog at the end of 2003 was up close to 16 million from the beginning of the year the company’s new product and business development programs aided by a rebound in the global manufacturing sector and the weakening dollar provides optimism for 2004 

effects of foreign currency the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on sales and operating results cannot be precisely measured because of fluctuating selling prices sales volume product mix and cost structures in each country where nordson operates as a rule a weakening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies has a favorable effect on sales and net income while a strengthening of the us dollar has a detrimental effect 

17 in 2003 compared with 2002 the us dollar was generally weaker against foreign currencies if 2002 exchange rates had been in effect during 2003 sales would have been approximately 377 million lower and thirdparty costs would have been approximately 224 million lower in 2002 compared with 2001 the us dollar was also generally weaker against foreign currencies if 2001 exchange rates had been in effect during 2002 sales would have been approximately 22 million lower and thirdparty costs would have been approximately 15 million lower these effects on reported sales do not include the impact of local price adjustments made in response to changes in currency exchange rates 


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company operates internationally and enters into transactions denominated in foreign currencies consequently the company is subject to market risk arising from exchange rate movements between the dates foreign currencies are recorded and the dates they are settled nordson regularly uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce its risks related to most of these transactions these contracts primarily euro and yen usually have maturities of 90 days or less and generally require the company to exchange foreign currencies for us dollars at maturity at rates stated in the contracts gains and losses from changes in the market value of these contracts offset foreign exchange losses and gains respectively on the underlying transactions the balance of transactions denominated in foreign currencies are designated as hedges of the company’s net investments in foreign subsidiaries or are intercompany transactions of a longterm investment nature as a result of the company’s use of foreign exchange contracts on a routine basis to reduce the risks related to nearly all of the company’s transactions denominated in foreign currencies as of november 2 2003 the company did not have a material foreign currency risk related to its derivatives or other financial instruments note 10 to the financial statements contains additional information about the company’s foreign currency transactions and the methods and assumptions used by the company to record these transactions the company finances a portion of its operations with shortterm and longterm borrowings and is subject to market risk arising from changes in interest rates for most of its longterm debt the tables that follow present principal cash flows and related weightedaverage interest rates by expected maturity dates of fixedrate longterm debt expected maturity date november 2 2003  expected maturity date november 3 2002  18 the tables that follow present principal cash flows and related weightedaverage interest rates by expected maturity dates of variablerate longterm debt expected maturity date november 2 2003  expected maturity date november 3 2002  included in the table above is longterm debt in the amount of japanese yen 200 million this debt was converted from fixed rate to variable rate through an interest rate swap agreement as disclosed in note 10 to the company’s financial statements the weightedaverage interest rate of the company’s variablerate debt was 97 at the end of fiscal 2003 compared to 13 at the end of 2002 a 1 increase in interest rates would have resulted in approximately 157000 of additional interest expense in fiscal 2003 the company also has variablerate notes payable the weighted average interest rate of this debt was 25 at the end of 2003 compared to 30 at the end of 2002 a 1 increase in interest rates would have resulted in additional interest expense of approximately 834000 on the notes payable in fiscal 2003 inflation inflation affects profit margins because the ability to pass cost increases on to customers is restricted by the need for competitive pricing although inflation has been modest in recent years and has had no material effect on the years covered by these financial statements nordson continues to seek ways to minimize the impact of inflation it does so through focused efforts to raise its productivity 

trends the fiveyear summary in item 6 documents nordson’s historical financial trends over this period the world’s economic conditions fluctuated significantly nordson’s solid performance is attributed to the company’s participation in diverse geographic and industrial markets and its longterm commitment to develop and provide quality products and worldwide service to meet customers’ changing needs

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend critical accounting policies and estimates the company’s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires the company’s management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses on an ongoing basis the company evaluates the accounting policies and estimates it uses to prepare financial statements the company bases its estimates on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates used by management certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to the company’s results of operations or financial position are discussed below 

revenue recognition  — most of the company’s revenues are recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the sales price is fixed or determinable collectibility is reasonably assured and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer a limited number of the company’s large engineered systems sales contracts are accounted for using the percentageofcompletion method the amount of revenue recognized in any accounting period is based on the ratio of actual costs incurred through the end of the period to total estimated costs at completion during 2002 the company recognized approximately 20 million of revenue under this method with respect to one contract which was substantially completed prior to yearend the remaining revenues are recognized upon delivery 10 goodwill  — goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired at november 3 2002 goodwill represented approximately 43 percent of the company’s total assets the majority of the goodwill resulted from the acquisition of efd inc in 2001 in 2002 the company adopted fasb statement no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” which provides that goodwill should not be amortized but instead be tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level in accordance with no 142 the company completed a transitional goodwill impairment test that resulted in no impairment loss being recognized goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and more often if indications of impairment exist the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined by applying appropriate discount rates to estimated future cash flows and terminal value amounts for the reporting units the results of the company’s analyses indicated that no reduction of goodwill is required in 2001 goodwill amortization was 15446000 11243000 on an aftertax basis or 34 per share in 2000 goodwill amortization was 5110000 3347000 on an aftertax basis or 10 per share inventories  — inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market cost has been determined using the lastin firstout method for 38 percent of the company’s consolidated inventories at november 3 2002 with the firstin firstout method used for the remaining inventory on an ongoing basis the company tests its inventory for technical obsolescence as well as for future demand and changes in market conditions the company has historically maintained inventory reserves to reflect those conditions when the cost of inventory is not expected to be recovered in the face of difficult economic conditions that accelerated the technical obsolescence of certain inventory and impacted the demand outlook for other inventory the company recognized an inventory writedown of 114 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 76 million on an aftertax basis or 23 per share pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans  — the measurement of liabilities related to pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans is based on management’s assumptions related to future events including interest rates return on pension plan assets compensation increases and health care cost trend rates the discount rates used to determine the present value of future benefits are based on yields of aa quality or better fixed income investments the weighted average discount rate used to value pension plan obligations was 65 percent at november 3 2002 compared to 69 percent at october 28 2001 the rate used to value the postretirement obligation was 675 percent at november 3 2002 compared to 725 percent at october 28 2001 annual expense amounts are determined based on the discount rate at the end of the prior year the expected rate of return on pension assets is designed to be a longterm assumption that will be subject to yeartoyear variability the rate for 2002 was decreased to 86 percent from 95 percent in 2001 during 2002 the fair market value of pension plan assets decreased actual pension plan asset performance will either reduce or increase unamortized losses which will ultimately affect net income the rate of compensation increases was reduced from 52 percent in 2001 to 37 percent in 2002 to reflect actual experience the rate of increase in medical costs over the next five years was increased to reflect actual experience the health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported for example a onepercentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects  employees hired after january 1 2002 are not eligible to participate in the postretirement plan the overall effect of the assumption changes above will be to increase pension and postretirement expenses in fiscal 2003 11 financial instruments  — assets liabilities and commitments that are to be settled in cash and are denominated in foreign currencies are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates the company enters into foreign currency forward contracts which are derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of foreign currency exposures resulting from the collection of receivables payables and loans denominated in foreign currencies the maturities of these contracts are usually less than 90 days forward contracts are marked to market each accounting period and the resulting gains or losses are included in other income expense on the consolidated statement of income fiscal years 2002 and 2001 worldwide sales for 2002 were 6478 million down 11 percent from 2001 sales of 7314 million sales volume decreased 12 percent which was offset by favorable currency effects of 1 percent due to the weaker dollar 

sales volume in the company’s adhesive dispensing systems segment decreased 4 percent increases in packaging sales volume were more than offset by lower sales of nonwoven systems in north america advanced technology segment volume was down 29 percent primarily due to the continuing global slowdown in the semiconductor and electronics industries coating and finishing systems segment sales volume was down 13 percent influenced significantly by lower engineered systems sales in north america it is estimated that the effect of pricing on total revenues was neutral relative to the prior year nordson’s sales outside the united states accounted for 57 percent of total 2002 sales compared with 54 percent for 2001 sales volume decreased in all four of nordson’s geographic regions volume decreased 17 percent in north america 3 percent in europe 15 percent in japan and 9 percent in the pacific south region the slowdown in advanced technology and capital goods sectors was felt across all of these regions gross margins before restructuring charges and inventory writedowns expressed as a percentage of sales were 538 percent in 2002 compared with 540 percent in 2001 a change in the mix of products sold pricing pressures and higher indirect costs caused the lower margins the company recognized a fourth quarter inventory writedown of 114 million 76 million on an aftertax basis or 23 per share gross margins including restructuring charges and inventory writedowns were 521 percent in 2002 down from 539 percent in 2001 selling and administrative expenses excluding goodwill amortization and severance and restructuring costs were 435 percent of sales in 2002 and 418 percent in 2001 spending for 2002 decreased 79 percent as a result of the company’s organizational

a result of the continuing economic slowdown during 2002 the company recognized 27 million 18 million on an aftertax basis or 05 per share of nonrecurring charges consisting of severance and other costs associated with the combination of certain businesses of the total amount 2 million is included in cost of sales it is anticipated that additional costs of approximately 2 million primarily related to severance payments will be incurred in fiscal 2003 annualized savings from the company’s restructuring actions that began in 2000 are projected to be in excess of 40 million worldwide operating profits expressed as a percentage of sales before the effects of nonrecurring charges were 104 percent in 2002 compared with 101 percent for 2001 segment operating profit percentages in 2002 and 2001 excluding corporate expenses which are not allocated to segments were as follows  all segments were impacted by the global economic downturn 12 interest expense of 217 million decreased 78 million from 2001 primarily due to lower borrowing levels other income decreased 55 million from 2001 which included a gain of 51 million on the sale of real estate nordson’s effective tax rate was 3300 percent in 2002 compared with a rate of 3475 percent in 2001 the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party prp at a wisconsin municipal landfill and has voluntarily agreed with other prp’s to share costs associated with a feasibility study and remedial investigation “fs ri” for the site with the company committing up to 325000 toward the fs ri this amount has been recorded in the company’s financial statements the fs ri is expected to be completed in 2005 the total cost of the company’s share for site remediation cannot be determined at this time but based on current information the company does not expect that the costs associated with remediation will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations net income in 2002 was 221 million or 66 per share on a diluted basis compared with 246 million or 74 per share on a diluted basis in 2001 excluding goodwill amortization net income for 2001 was 359 million or 108 per share excluding the effects of severance and restructuring costs and inventory writedowns net income in 2002 was 315 million or 94 per share compared with 338 million or 102 per share for 2001 450 million or 136 per share without goodwill amortization severance and restructuring costs and inventory writedowns on an aftertax basis totaled 94 million or 28 per share for 2002 and 92 million or 28 per share on a diluted basis for 2001 in august 2001 the fasb issued statement no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” no 143 requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred when a liability is initially recorded the entity capitalizes a cost by increasing the carrying value of the related longlived asset over time the liability is accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset upon settlement of the liability an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement the company is required to adopt no 143 in fiscal 2003 and has not yet determined the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial position or results of operations in october 2001 the fasb issued statement no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” no 144 which supersedes no 121 “accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and for longlived assets to be disposed of” provides a single accounting model for longlived assets to be disposed of although retaining many of the fundamental recognition and measurement provisions of no 121 this statement significantly changes the criteria that would have to be met to classify an asset as heldforsale this distinction is important because assets heldforsale are stated at the lower of their fair values or carrying amounts and depreciation is no longer recognized the company is required to adopt no 144 in fiscal 2003 and has not yet determined the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial position or results of operations in may 2002 the fasb issued statement no 145 “rescission of statements no 4 44 and 64 amendment of fasb statement no 13 and technical corrections” this statement eliminates the requirement that gains and losses on the early extinguishment of debt be classified as extraordinary items it also provides guidance with respect to the accounting for gains and losses on capital leases that were modified to become operating leases the company is required to adopt no 145 in 2003 and there will be no impact as a result of the adoption in june 2002 the fasb issued statement no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” no 146 requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan examples of costs covered by the standard include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring discontinued operation plant closing or other exit or disposal activity no 146 is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december 31 2002 13 fiscal years 2001 and 2000 worldwide sales for 2001 were 7314 million down 1 percent from 2000 sales of 7406 million sales volume increased 2 percent which was offset by negative currency effects of 3 percent due to the stronger dollar excluding sales from efd inc which was acquired on october 30 2000 volume was down 5 percent 

sales volume in the company’s adhesive dispensing systems segment decreased 3 percent advanced technology segment volume was up 32 percent as a result of the efd acquisition excluding efd sales volume for this segment was off 11 percent primarily due to the global slowdown in the semiconductor and electronics industries coating and finishing systems sales volume was down 7 percent influenced by weak demand for powder engineered systems in the united states it is estimated that the effect of pricing on total revenues was neutral relative to the prior year nordson’s sales outside the united states accounted for 54 percent of total 2001 sales compared with 55 percent for 2000 the addition of efd resulted in volume gains in all of nordson’s four geographic regions excluding efd volume decreased 7 percent in north america 5 percent in europe and 6 percent in the pacific south region the slowdown in advanced technology was felt across all of these regions sales volume rose 1 percent in japan aided by gains in the advanced technology segment gross margins before restructuring charges expressed as a percentage of sales were 540 percent in 2001 compared with 551 percent in 2000 unfavorable currency effects a change in the mix of products sold pricing pressures and higher indirect costs were partially offset by the higher margins reported by efd selling and administrative expenses excluding goodwill amortization and severance and restructuring costs were 418 percent of sales in 2001 and 408 percent in 2000 spending for 2001 increased 12 percent excluding efd spending was down 5 percent with favorable currency translation effects accounting for more than onehalf of the decline goodwill amortization increased as a result of the efd acquisition during 2001 continuing activity related to the company’s action 2000 initiative resulted in the recognition of 140 million 92 million on an aftertax basis or 28 per share of nonrecurring charges consisting of severance and other costs associated with the combination of certain businesses the amount related to inventory writeoffs 7 million is included in cost of sales worldwide operating profits expressed as a percentage of sales before the effects of nonrecurring charges were 101 percent in 2001 compared with 136 percent for 2000 segment operating profit percentages in 2001 and 2000 excluding corporate expenses which are not allocated to segments were as follows  all segments were impacted by the global economic downturn the addition of efd had a positive effect on the profitability of the advanced technology segment interest expense of 295 million increased 178 million over 2000 due to increased borrowing levels as a result of the efd acquisition other income included a gain of 51 million on the sale of real estate nordson’s effective tax rate was 3475 percent in 2001 compared with a rate of 3450 percent in 2000 net income in 2001 was 246 million or 74 per share on a diluted basis compared with 546 million or 167 per share on a diluted basis in 2000 excluding the effects of severance and restructuring costs net income in 2001 was 338 million or 102 per share compared with 605 million or 185 per share for 2000 nonrecurring charges on an aftertax basis totaled 92 million or 28 per share for 2001 and 59 million or 18 per share on a diluted basis for 2000 14 liquidity capital expenditures and sources of capital during 2002 cash generated by operations was 1304 million up from 734 million in 2001 working capital excluding cash and notes payable decreased over 68 million accounts receivable were down more than 32 million from the prior yearend due to the downturn in business activity and improvement in days’ sales outstanding inventories and accounts payable decreased as a result of a lower level of business activity and the company’s efforts to improve working capital efficiencies pension and retirement obligations increased due to a decrease in the value of plan assets and changes in actuarial assumptions 

significant uses of cash included capital expenditures dividends and repayments of over 110 million of notes payable and longterm debt nordson concentrated the majority of its 2002 capital expenditures on information systems and lab equipment dividend payments to shareholders on a pershare basis increased 2 percent over 2001 the following table summarizes the company’s obligations as of november 3 2002  nordson has various lines of credit with both domestic and foreign banks at november 3 2002 these lines totaled 309 million of which 200 million was unused included in the total amount of 309 million is a 250 million facility with a group of banks that expires in 2006 the company believes that the combination of present capital resources internally generated funds and unused financing sources are more than adequate to meet cash requirements for 2003 there are no significant restrictions limiting the transfer of funds from international subsidiaries to the parent company the company has an operating lease for office and manufacturing space with a partnership in which the company is a partner the lease contains an option to purchase the property at fair market value and the company intends to exercise the option in 2003 the amount of debt that would be assumed would be less than 11 million and is approximately equal to the current fair market value of the property outlook while the immediate outlook for the global economy is uncertain we remain confident that the combination of our market leadership geographic and technological diversity new product offerings and our leaner moreflexible infrastructure will allow us to respond effectively to customer demands as conditions improve 

effects of foreign currency the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on sales and operating results cannot be precisely measured because of fluctuating selling prices sales volume product mix and cost structures in each country where nordson operates as a rule a weakening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies has a favorable effect on sales and net income while a strengthening of the us dollar has a detrimental effect 

15 in 2002 compared with 2001 the us dollar was generally weaker against foreign currencies if 2001 exchange rates had been in effect during 2002 sales would have been approximately 22 million lower and thirdparty costs would have been approximately 15 million lower in 2001 compared with 2000 the us dollar was generally stronger against foreign currencies if 2000 exchange rates had been in effect during 2001 sales would have been approximately 254 million higher and thirdparty costs would have been approximately 155 million higher these effects on reported sales do not include the impact of local price adjustments made in response to changes in currency exchange rates 


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company operates internationally and enters into transactions denominated in foreign currencies consequently the company is subject to market risk arising from exchange rate movements between the dates foreign currencies are recorded and the dates they are settled nordson regularly uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce its risks related to most of these transactions these contracts primarily euro and yen usually have maturities of 90 days or less and generally require the company to exchange foreign currencies for us dollars at maturity at rates stated in the contracts gains and losses from changes in the market value of these contracts offset foreign exchange losses and gains respectively on the underlying transactions the balance of transactions denominated in foreign currencies are designated as hedges of the company’s net investments in foreign subsidiaries or are intercompany transactions of a longterm investment nature as a result of the company’s use of foreign exchange contracts on a routine basis to reduce the risks related to nearly all of the company’s transactions denominated in foreign currencies as of november 3 2002 the company did not have a material foreign currency risk related to its derivatives or other financial instruments note 10 to the financial statements contains additional information about the company’s foreign currency transactions and the methods and assumptions used by the company to record these transactions the company finances a portion of its operations with shortterm and longterm borrowings and is subject to market risk arising from changes in interest rates for most of its longterm debt the tables that follow present principal cash flows and related weightedaverage interest rates by expected maturity dates of fixedrate longterm debt expected maturity date november 3 2002  expected maturity date october 28 2001  16 inflation inflation affects profit margins because the ability to pass cost increases on to customers is restricted by the need for competitive pricing although inflation has been modest in recent years and has had no material effect on the years covered by these financial statements nordson continues to seek ways to minimize the impact of inflation it does so through focused efforts to raise its productivity 

trends the fiveyear summary in item 6 documents nordson’s historical financial trends over this period the world’s economic conditions fluctuated significantly nordson’s solid performance is attributed to the company’s participation in diverse geographic and industrial markets and its longterm commitment to develop and provide quality products and worldwide service to meet customers’ changing needs
